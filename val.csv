good afternoon to our friends in the south just sending this message to open a channel for future relations when ever they need to happen and to say howdy and have a good game to you,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,0,Spring,1901
of course i thank you very much the future of the kaissereich and its effect on my neighbors will be very important to me so tell me if you want help to dissuade attack,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,1,Spring,1901
well should the french turn out to be a thorn in my side i would greatly appreciate the aid,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,2,Spring,1901
greetings from new italy,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,3,Spring,1901
would just like to reiterate that italy would likely take an opportunistic stance towards france  their defensive position is strong enough that i wont attack them proactively but if they are locked into a conflict with you i might stab them,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,4,Spring,1901
so in that sense italy is broadly friendly to your interests  if you and france are allied i will leave you alone but if france is your enemy i could potentially help you to break a stalemate,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,5,Spring,1901
but what id need in exchange is for you to keep me posted on developments in the west are you leaning towards working with england or france,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,6,Spring,1901
it seems for the moment that both are cooperative but im likely to side with the french from the outset barring difficulties with them ill keep you posted same relationship as previously established in any case friendship with the french is not very likely to last past englands demise so ill definitely need the help then thank,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,7,Spring,1901
makes sense hopefully ill be on the winning side of a conflict against turkey or austria by then which should put us in position to squeeze france,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,8,Spring,1901
id greatly prefer you end up on austrias side of that conflict all things considered but if things dont go his way i wouldnt blame you for siding against them,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,9,Spring,1901
definitely understandable but since italy starts off as one of the weaker countries i basically need to play a little opportunistically,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,10,Spring,1901
the elephant in the room is russia  would you have any insight on what theyre planning,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,11,Spring,1901
unfortunately we only talked very briefly about staying out of each others ways,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,12,Spring,1901
haha didnt try to hold sweden hostage to get him to play nice with austria thats my usual goto as germany lol,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,13,Spring,1901
have you talked more with austria i must admit to being concerned about you moving to tyrolia in their defense,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,14,Spring,1901
since that would allow the two of you to launch a pretty credible attack on venetia,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,15,Spring,1901
as germany i generally play somewhat more careful get them to just promise not to be an enemy until the western triple becomes a western double as far as austria goes were allied hence my preference for turkey being your foe rather than them ive no intent of turning south though not by any means dont have the pieces for that,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,16,Spring,1901
yeah fair enough im planning on a pretty standard opening to ionian sea aiming to convoy to tunis and with a bounce in austria,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,17,Spring,1901
its a pretty noncommittal move so will wait and see how things play out,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,18,Spring,1901
but im sure nobody will miss the fact that it sets me up for the lepanto if the cards fall that wau,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,19,Spring,1901
well the lepanto setup is generally considered italys best opener regardless of whether they trust austria hard to argue with a classic,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,20,Spring,1901
its looking like the russians and the turks are trying a juggernaut,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,21,Fall,1901
if they do that we desperately need to be strongly allied with the austrians otherwise theyll roll us over hard,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,22,Fall,1901
i am also concerned about the juggernaut which pushes me towards you and austrias camp,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,23,Fall,1901
it seems france and england are at a loggerhead already so if you side with england it might be an opportunity for me as well,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,24,Fall,1901
our interests are aligned in both sides of the map so lets just coordinate closely,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,25,Fall,1901
id be more comfortable committing both fleets east to support austria against turkey if i knew you were going to burgundy which makes it harder for france to convoy to tuscany,1,True,-1,italy,germany,11,26,Spring,1902
frances f marseille is a major headache for me,1,True,-1,italy,germany,11,27,Spring,1902
what say you,1,True,-1,italy,germany,11,28,Spring,1902
france is definitely going to be a thorn in your side unfortunately i can neither afford to attack them right now nor likely convince them to not attack you theyre more powerful than i am and ive already pissed off two of my three potentially unfriendly neighbors,1,True,1,germany,italy,11,29,Fall,1902
the balkan front is pretty secure for you two though you can at least hold and with some tricky maneuvering very easily begin advancing through the turks,1,True,1,germany,italy,11,30,Fall,1902
understood know that austria and italy are not going to be able to hold out against russia and turkey,1,True,-1,italy,germany,11,31,Fall,1902
if you want to prevent a juggernaut we will need whatever help from you we can get,1,True,-1,italy,germany,11,32,Fall,1902
well as im sure youve noticed ive mobilized for the task,1,True,1,germany,italy,11,33,Fall,1902
ive talked to the french to try and get them off your back but theyre dedicated to seeing you off they told me to tell you that they plan to attack piedmont with support which indicates that theyre probably planning a convoy to tuscany you cant let that happen,1,True,1,germany,italy,11,34,Fall,1902
well it seems the attack on piedmont with support was genuine which seems like a very poor decision by the french,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,35,Winter,1902
yeah maybe they predicted that youd think they were lying to me regardless bad move on their part in any case especially since you have a build,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,36,Winter,1902
good news for you though a distracted france is still more than enough firepower to get you through england and it makes it easy for you to stab them after,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,37,Winter,1902
i dont know whether you deliberately leaked me that intel thinking i would disbelieve it and go to tuscany but no hard feeling if so,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,38,Winter,1902
thats jsut well played,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,39,Winter,1902
it certainly does i wish theyd let you get on with destroying the turks so you could focus fire on them when its needed but still and i gave you that information because i genuinely thought that their objective would be to get you to expect what they told me to tell you so they could do something else was worried that theyd do the convoy because that would be devastating for you,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,40,Winter,1902
haha honestly that risk was very top of mind for me since i attempted the same convoy as france in the previous game,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,41,Winter,1902
so would likely have made the risk averse move to avoid the convoy even without the warning,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,42,Winter,1902
yeah its a real powermove as the french to pull off that convoy,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,43,Winter,1902
well it didnt work for me either,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,44,Winter,1902
well experienced italys generally see it coming,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,45,Winter,1902
indeed,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,46,Winter,1902
im trying to do damage control with the austrians it was incredibly damaging for them to do that and i cant imagine why theyve decided to side with the turks rather than you if it doesnt work out im going to go nuclear and split them lengthways with the turks,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,47,Spring,1903
i was taken very surprised in large part because i didnt see  and still dont see  what they stand to gain,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,48,Spring,1903
and if they really stand to gain ground why not make a play for venice,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,49,Spring,1903
no idea the y apparently arent interested in working with you anymore im quite frankly pulling my hair over this its the worst possible move,1,True,0,germany,italy,11,50,Spring,1903
i find myself very confused by it as well which is part of why i am not quite sure how to respond,1,True,0,italy,germany,11,51,Fall,1903
would you be willing to coordinate against a tyrolia id be happy to support a munich in,1,True,-3,italy,germany,11,52,Spring,1904
im afraid that if i do that my current position could quickly become untenable im worried that the austrians are planning something funky,1,True,3,germany,italy,11,53,Spring,1904
alright so i realize that this is a little bit late but now that the austrians are embroiled with the turks i am moving against the french im trying to convince the austrians that its in their best interests to join back with you but i would understand if you might resent him or both of us for our failure to consistently side with you,1,True,3,germany,italy,11,54,Fall,1904
you stabbing the french is already a massive lifeline to me i could not in good conscious ask you to do more,1,True,-6,italy,germany,11,55,Winter,1904
i will listen to what austria has to say and keep you updated on that front i do not really trust them but i may still be willing to work with them against the turks if they say the right things,1,True,-6,italy,germany,11,56,Winter,1904
im moving on the french this next season hopefully theyll pull back to face me and you and the british will be able to surge back against them,1,True,6,germany,italy,11,57,Winter,1904
im pleasantly surprised that youre so willing to work with england as well,1,True,-6,italy,germany,11,58,Winter,1904
in that case ill play defensively but try to set myself up for a counteroffensive,1,True,-6,italy,germany,11,59,Winter,1904
well the english are a little miffed that i didnt move last season but still i see no reason not to work with them for the time being,1,True,6,germany,italy,11,60,Winter,1904
yeah agreed the english are too desperate to turn down your support,1,True,-6,italy,germany,11,61,Spring,1905
conversely you have a free walk into paris right now,1,True,-6,italy,germany,11,62,Spring,1905
since france has only fleets,1,True,-6,italy,germany,11,63,Spring,1905
a mun  bur and then to paris is guarrenteed to succeed as long as you can cover a potential stab on mun which you could easily do with a ber,1,True,-6,italy,germany,11,64,Spring,1905
and then a holbel isnt quite as foolproof but is pretty safe as well,1,True,-6,italy,germany,11,65,Spring,1905
especially if you support yourself into nth and move kie  hol,1,True,-6,italy,germany,11,66,Spring,1905
if youre wondering who convinced the french to make it a fleet you need go no further,1,True,6,germany,italy,11,67,Spring,1905
well sounds like things are in good shape,1,True,-6,italy,germany,11,68,Spring,1905
hopefully the french are sufficiently distracted that you can launch a counter attack,1,True,6,germany,italy,11,69,Spring,1905
yeah ill make the most of this,1,True,-6,italy,germany,11,70,Fall,1905
the austrians wouldnt happen to be talking about me would they,1,True,8,germany,italy,11,71,Spring,1906
i havent heard anything from them,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,72,Spring,1906
well at the very least thats good im worried about them potentially deciding that they want warsaw despite the fact that im on the right side of a stalemate line where theyd only get 1 supply center if they attacked,1,True,8,germany,italy,11,73,Spring,1906
are you coordinating with the turks i think that for the time being that would be a good idea,1,True,8,germany,italy,11,74,Fall,1906
yeah am trying to do so,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,75,Fall,1906
not to be needy or anything but i would greatly appreciate a hard move for venice this next year,1,,8,germany,italy,11,76,Fall,1906
i will make a play for venice this fall,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,77,Fall,1907
if i was in austrias shoes i would do a self bounce of f ven  tri a ser  tri,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,78,Fall,1907
so i plan to do f alb s f ven  tri a apu  ven,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,79,Fall,1907
odds of succeeding in this improve dramatically if also support with a tyr s a apu  ven  would you be willing to do so,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,80,Fall,1907
gas and bur likely cannot take mar anyways so in my view you would be better off using a par  a pic s a gas  bre f nth s f bel  eng a bur  mun,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,81,Fall,1907
this would be a nearguarantee that you take brest and would occupy f eng as a consolation prize in the only outcome where you didnt while still covering munich,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,82,Fall,1907
my only problem with that plan is that it risks losing burgundy if the french pull a fast one and go for silesia instead while moving marseilles into burgundy,1,True,8,germany,italy,11,83,Fall,1907
thats a valid point my view is that a mar  bur is unlikely but a boh  sil is a real risk,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,84,Fall,1907
if you want to keep france out of bohemia a gal is the only unit you have that can do so,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,85,Fall,1907
which might be a better investment that using it to try and snipe bud,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,86,Fall,1907
although actually if you hit vienna and france has two disbands they may struggle to keep up the pressure around silesia,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,87,Fall,1907
thats true i dont know if i want to take my chances with that though,1,True,8,germany,italy,11,88,Fall,1907
ill probably move into vienna but im not sure i can afford to move out of burgundy,1,True,8,germany,italy,11,89,Fall,1907
understood so then you would use a gal to cover warsaw a bur to cover munich and then try to snipe vienna with a tyr,1,True,-8,italy,germany,11,90,Fall,1907
correct,1,True,8,germany,italy,11,91,Fall,1907
how’s it going italy,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,0,Spring,1901
relatively well im doing a small concert soon so kind of nervous honestly how about you,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,1,Spring,1901
im assuming we can both agree to a nonaggression pact and that you too were told to lepanto the turks though im not sure if its a good idea,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,2,Spring,1901
were the only ones i trust to understand how unlikely a solo is and you seem interested in cooperation so ill honestly put all my chips under your bag and defend you until the end if youre willing to do the same with me,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,3,Spring,1901
at the very least we can give one hell of a ride,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,4,Spring,1901
i haven’t been told to do a lepanto yet who said that and yes i would like peace on our front i could have a three front war at any time so it would be great if you and i did not fight where would you expand to then,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,5,Spring,1901
i will be moving into ven with tri traditional austrian opening and fully understand that you would go ven to tri as a response so that we bounce if you can come up with a good alternative then i am fine with that but i don’t see one,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,6,Spring,1901
i am perfectly comfortable with a ventri bounce so no need for further discussion on that point would like to suggest that we demilitarize tyrolia at least for year one as well,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,7,Spring,1901
would like to get your thoughts on your other moves is a budapest going to serbia and is a vienna going to galicia or allowing russia in,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,8,Spring,1901
okay the bounce sounds good and i would love to demilitarize tyr for this year and we can talk about it again then,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,9,Spring,1901
why do you need my moves,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,10,Spring,1901
i think in general it pays to know as much as possible about what everyone is doing even if they lie it helps you get an early picture on who is trustworthy p,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,11,Spring,1901
but i think the austria italy relationship is bigger than that,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,12,Spring,1901
austria and italy are two countries which can easily fall into a mutually destructive war until they both get eaten by turkey,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,13,Spring,1901
but its also very hard for us to trust each other since its so easy to stab thats a big part of what makes these two countries so challenging for a lot of players right,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,14,Spring,1901
in that sense it helps for us to be open with each other its a very different game for me if russia gets into galicia early putting them and turkey in place to roll the map compared to if you and turkey push russia out of rumania in year one,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,15,Spring,1901
in that context im pretty comfortable telling you that i dont plan to get greedy in year 1  as long as i can secure tunisia while keeping a secure defensive position im happy,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,16,Spring,1901
i 100 do not want to fight you i agree that austria italy is a war that often happens but never really works out for either side we would just stagnate until russia or turkey or both took us out,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,17,Fall,1901
on that note i have heard rumors that turkey and russia are gonna go for a juggernaut if that is the case i’d assume you would help me slow them down,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,18,Fall,1901
probably don’t need to point this out but you allying with turkey would eventually lead to him attacking you unless you stabbed him first,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,19,Fall,1901
definitely agree that assuming we can trust each other the austriaitaly alliance tends to be more stable than the austriaturkey one,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,20,Fall,1901
turkey and russia bounced in the black sea but that proves little since juggernaut allies often go for that anyways,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,21,Fall,1901
russia has committed pretty hard to the south which is mildly concerning for both of us in the event that the juggernaut materializes however my sense is that germany would also be willing to support us,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,22,Fall,1901
i guess for this year suggest that we do the ventri bounce again i would suggest to keep turkey out of greece and use vienna to defend against russia,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,23,Fall,1901
i will convoy a apulia to tunisia,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,24,Fall,1901
all sounds good to me,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,25,Fall,1901
have you talked to turkey much,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,26,Fall,1901
not a whole lot their move to the black sea was news to me,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,27,Winter,1901
so turkey went back on their deal with me and tried to let russia get rum while they snuck into gre juggernaut confirmed,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,28,Winter,1901
i’d like to propose that you and i go full alliance,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,29,Winter,1901
im game for the lepanto and it seems germany is on board as well,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,30,Winter,1901
what does that look like in practice germany builds in berlin you in budapest,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,31,Winter,1901
and then hit rumania in spring,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,32,Winter,1901
not positive what i would do yet but something along those lines you would definitely build a fleet in nap and then move ion to eas,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,33,Winter,1901
france and turkey are trying to get me to attack you obviously i will not do that,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,34,Spring,1902
with the build in marseilles frances goals are quite transparent,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,35,Spring,1902
turkey will likely bounce me in eas would you be willing to support me into greece via convoy,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,36,Spring,1902
from there i can support you into bulgaria,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,37,Spring,1902
i’m willing to debate it but i had a different view on this turn i figured he would bounce you in eas but what if you went for aeg instead unless you’re worried about over extending yourself due to france because i trust you enough at this point to move tri to alb and then we will definitely be able to get gre in the fall,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,38,Spring,1902
which makes going to aegeas a bit of an overstretch,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,39,Spring,1902
if we can get germany on board id feel a lot more comfortable with committing east,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,40,Spring,1902
sorry some connection issues on my end so messages sent out of order,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,41,Spring,1902
but basically im concerned about frances f marseille so a little nervous about committing both fleets east,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,42,Spring,1902
but i think having germany attack france would ease that,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,43,Spring,1902
so in theory if we could not get germany to attack france what kind of attack would you be comfortable with us making,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,44,Spring,1902
in which case convoying onto greece is the best use of the fleet and army id have available,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,45,Spring,1902
okay i will support that can you move out of ven,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,46,Spring,1902
so i am in a slightly sticky situation but i think i can get out of it if i support you holding in gre then would you move that fleet into eas,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,47,Fall,1902
also germany and france are allied however germany is also willing to help us out,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,48,Fall,1902
let me know what you’re thinking,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,49,Fall,1902
germany and france allying is not ideal for me but i feel confident in observing that turkey and russia are allied as well,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,50,Fall,1902
so desperate times call for desperate measures  may need to do what needs to be done to stop the juggernaut,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,51,Fall,1902
would appreciate you helping me to hold in greece and well need whatever help from germany that we can get,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,52,Fall,1902
i can still support a serbia  buglaria as well if that helps,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,53,Fall,1902
look at the moves from last turn turkey tried to support me attacking russia why do you think they are still allied,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,54,Fall,1902
to put it simply i missed that i find backstabbrs map interface hard to read and didnt see it in the list of orders,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,55,Winter,1902
which i will look at more carefully going forward,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,56,Winter,1902
i gotcha so you are clearly going after turkey right now but have to deal with france what’re you thinking in regards to that whole situation because i have to figure out whether or not i can use turkey as a short term ally vs russia,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,57,Winter,1902
however i view you as my most important ally which is why i’m asking you about all this,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,58,Winter,1902
i have moved against turkey but i am willing to back down to focus on france,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,59,Winter,1902
if you would rather coordinate with turkey against russia im open to the idea of a southern triple as turkey suggested,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,60,Winter,1902
i mean turkey knows that you and i are allied so i think that if you attack him then he will attack me i don’t really wanna fight him and russia at the same time,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,61,Winter,1902
do you think you can gain supply centers vs france i get that you need to expand somewhere,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,62,Winter,1902
what’re you thinking for this season,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,63,Spring,1903
i most likely cant gain a supply center this year but i should be able to gain ground as long as neither you nor turkey stab me,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,64,Spring,1903
my thinking is that ill go with the conservative option,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,65,Spring,1903
which is  f tys s f rome  tus a tus  ven,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,66,Spring,1903
and then withdraw f eas  ion,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,67,Spring,1903
should put me in position to push through wes starting fall while covering all my bases defeinsively,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,68,Spring,1903
that all seems logical,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,69,Spring,1903
what are you thinking f alb s a gre h would be appreciated in my perspective,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,70,Spring,1903
neither of us have a good reason to stab you we gotta focus on russia,0,True,0,austria,italy,11,71,Spring,1903
yeah naturally im concerned about what turkey will do once russia is defeated but thats a question for another day,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,72,Spring,1903
i’ll do that it keeps turkey from snagging gre,0,True,0,austria,italy,11,73,Spring,1903
do you have germany on your side as well,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,74,Spring,1903
so am i i’d expect they go through me before they go through you that is why i need you,0,True,0,austria,italy,11,75,Spring,1903
turkey has sev in their pocket which might open up a path to moscow,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,76,Spring,1903
for now he supported me into war which is nice so i will keep working with them,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,77,Spring,1903
but they might want it for themselves,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,78,Spring,1903
that is true,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,79,Spring,1903
makes sense keep me posted,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,80,Spring,1903
will do we gotta take another russia center this year,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,81,Spring,1903
not immediately relevant to us but i feel like sweden will be interesting too,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,82,Spring,1903
just because russia has a good shot at holding it if they can play england and germany against each other,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,83,Spring,1903
yeah i reached out to england to see what they think about all of this,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,84,Spring,1903
england seems to be a bit pessimistic which is probably justified facing a francegermany coalition,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,85,Spring,1903
although the fact that france is quite committed in the south and germany in the east improves their position a lot,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,86,Spring,1903
so about this whole greece affair,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,87,Spring,1903
understandably you would be mad at me about it i honestly just felt like i could use it better than you could,1,False,0,austria,italy,11,88,Spring,1903
i realize that sounds rude,1,False,0,austria,italy,11,89,Spring,1903
at least you have that much selfawareness we opened this game stating that conflict between italy and austria is usually selfdefeating but it is hard for us to trust each other,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,90,Fall,1903
now that you have betrayed that trust i dont really see a path forward away from that mutually destructive conflict,1,True,0,italy,austria,11,91,Fall,1903
understandable,1,True,0,austria,italy,11,92,Fall,1903
so you are now in conflict with all three of your allies,1,True,-3,italy,austria,11,93,Winter,1904
all three of your neighbors,1,True,-3,italy,austria,11,94,Winter,1904
france may defeat me but most likely you wouldnt see any centers from that and you wont win against turkey and germany,1,True,-3,italy,austria,11,95,Winter,1904
i dont trust you enough to seek an alliance but wouldnt  a ceasefire be mutually beneficial,1,True,-3,italy,austria,11,96,Winter,1904
both of us have our backs against the wall,1,True,-3,italy,austria,11,97,Winter,1904
yes a cease fire sounds perfect i need to handle turkey,1,True,3,austria,italy,11,98,Winter,1904
i understand why you don’t trust me however notice that i have not helped france and don’t actually want to see you off the board,1,True,3,austria,italy,11,99,Winter,1904
of course a cease fire is mutually beneficial enough that id have little doubts,1,True,-3,italy,austria,11,100,Spring,1905
but that said if you want to win back my trust supporting me into venice would be a great start,1,True,-3,italy,austria,11,101,Spring,1905
with a vie  tyr f tri s a romven,1,True,-3,italy,austria,11,102,Spring,1905
i would be guarrenteed to take it with no sc downside risk to you,1,True,-3,italy,austria,11,103,Spring,1905
so about your move to the ionian,1,True,-4,italy,austria,11,104,Spring,1906
turkey refuses to work with me,1,True,4,austria,italy,11,105,Spring,1906
well thats good news for me if you dont mind me saying so,1,True,-4,italy,austria,11,106,Spring,1906
lol yeah i know,1,,4,austria,italy,11,107,Spring,1906
well done on slipping into serbia,1,True,-3,italy,austria,11,108,Fall,1907
i assume you aim to push further in the balkans,1,True,-3,italy,austria,11,109,Fall,1907
not really sure yet i think this game is a lost cause for me,1,True,3,austria,italy,11,110,Fall,1907
not sure if now is the right time for told you sos but my statement that italyaustria conflict would ultimately lead to both of us going down seems pretty on the mark right now,1,True,-3,italy,austria,11,111,Fall,1907
hahahahaha,1,True,3,austria,italy,11,112,Fall,1907
i suck as austria,1,True,3,austria,italy,11,113,Fall,1907
to be fair austria is one of the harder countries on the map,1,True,-2,italy,austria,11,114,Winter,1907
you basically need to play both sides with russia and turkey just to have a chance at winning,1,True,-2,italy,austria,11,115,Winter,1907
even if youre only aiming for second place or to survive and draw you need to pick your partners well,1,True,-2,italy,austria,11,116,Winter,1907
haha i appreciate it italy is obviously hard as well i have a weird affection for playing it though,1,True,2,austria,italy,11,117,Spring,1908
so this is the point in the game where you probably need to start thinking about your goals,1,True,-2,italy,austria,11,118,Fall,1908
if your goal is to survive you would be best placed in going into moscow and then slipping into scandinavia,1,True,-2,italy,austria,11,119,Fall,1908
germany has pivoted strongly west so they would not easily retake it,1,True,-2,italy,austria,11,120,Fall,1908
and a draw would likely be germany plus whatever opposing alliance  occupying german territory would make you a key part of that draw alliance,1,True,-2,italy,austria,11,121,Fall,1908
alright heres an offer,1,True,3,italy,austria,11,122,Winter,1908
if you can capture st petersburg from germany while holding on to moscow,1,True,3,italy,austria,11,123,Winter,1908
and that enables us to stalemate against germany,1,True,3,italy,austria,11,124,Winter,1908
we can include you as one of the survivors in the draw,1,True,3,italy,austria,11,125,Winter,1908
i can probably get turkey on board for this france would have no choice but to accept,1,True,3,italy,austria,11,126,Winter,1908
yeah i’m gonna try and stop germany,1,True,-3,austria,italy,11,127,Spring,1909
understood i will stay out of budapest you should be able to get a build there from taking warsaw and vienna,1,True,3,italy,austria,11,128,Fall,1909
would a vienna be able to support me into tyrolia,1,True,3,italy,austria,11,129,Fall,1909
would be going from trieste venice will also support,1,True,3,italy,austria,11,130,Fall,1909
yes i will,1,True,-3,austria,italy,11,131,Fall,1909
hello  how goes the mighty tsar,1,,-1,italy,russia,11,0,Spring,1901
hi italy hope youre doing well where are you planning to head first,1,True,1,russia,italy,11,1,Spring,1901
greetings russia this is the new italy,1,,-1,italy,russia,11,2,Spring,1901
this will sound like flattery but i feel like russia is the one country italy cannot offend an italyturkey alliance cannot defeat russia and austria and similarly italy and austria cannot defeat russia and turkey unless germany joins as well,1,,-1,italy,russia,11,3,Spring,1901
so rather than deciding whether i want to attack austria or turkey id want to target the same one as you,1,,-1,italy,russia,11,4,Spring,1901
attacking france early is a fools errand,1,,-1,italy,russia,11,5,Spring,1901
oh shucks so much flattery right out of the gate,1,True,1,russia,italy,11,6,Spring,1901
its pretty neutral with both so far  perhaps youre leaning one way right now,1,True,1,russia,italy,11,7,Spring,1901
hahaha italy is one of the weaker powers on the board i need to be proactive in seeking allies even if it means accepting being the junior partner and russia is the natural first choice,1,,-1,italy,russia,11,8,Spring,1901
between austria and turkey i havent had a lot of time to talk to either yet so dont have a clear sense on who would make a better ally,1,,-1,italy,russia,11,9,Spring,1901
austria has been playing his hands close to his chest while turkey is from my home town but you dont do well in diplomacy by relying on those kinds of calculations,1,,-1,italy,russia,11,10,Spring,1901
lol usually not  where are you looking to focus for now,1,True,1,russia,italy,11,11,Fall,1901
as is often the case for italy i want to avoid commitment for now and see how the bigger fish play before making my move,1,,-1,italy,russia,11,12,Winter,1901
it seems theres some hostility between you and germany,1,,-1,italy,russia,11,13,Winter,1901
am also curious if turkeys move to black sea was arranged or if it also hostile,1,,-1,italy,russia,11,14,Winter,1901
arranged,1,True,1,russia,italy,11,15,Spring,1902
understood,1,,-1,italy,russia,11,16,Fall,1902
so things probably havent been going to plan for either of us,1,,1,italy,russia,11,17,Fall,1903
but austria serves as a common enemy,1,,1,italy,russia,11,18,Fall,1903
whats your plan for a galicia,1,,1,italy,russia,11,19,Fall,1903
hows everyones favorite geopolitical powerhouse,1,True,0,italy,england,11,0,Spring,1901
💪,1,True,0,england,italy,11,1,Spring,1901
feeling grand  not sure if we directly impact each other for a while but we both border people who do  i still havent decided what im going to do but knowing if youll be opening against france or not will help me figure it out,1,True,0,england,italy,11,2,Spring,1901
greetings from new italy would love to get your thoughts on france and germany,1,True,0,italy,england,11,3,Spring,1901
italy typically wants to involve itself more on the eastern triangle but it still borders both,1,True,0,italy,england,11,4,Spring,1901
in the west i am likely to play as an opportunist  if you ally with one against the third i will help the two of you for a center or two but otherwise i wont get involved,1,True,0,italy,england,11,5,Spring,1901
so i guess you can view me as a resource in that sense,1,True,0,italy,england,11,6,Spring,1901
well considering the opening i’d say i’m anti france i will be working with germany against france pressure in piedmont and med would be appreciated you’re bound to pick up a few dots if germany and i work well against france,1,True,0,england,italy,11,7,Fall,1901
makes sense ill check with germany but should be on board,1,True,0,italy,england,11,8,Fall,1901
im getting the feeling that a gf is forming against me  what have your conversations been like with germany,1,True,0,england,italy,11,9,Fall,1901
most of my conversation with germany has centered around the possibility of a russia turkey juggernaut which they seem quite concerned about,1,True,0,italy,england,11,10,Winter,1901
if you help then against russia that might put you on better terms,1,True,0,italy,england,11,11,Winter,1901
i am having trouble trusting germany although without that trust the jug will be unstoppable,1,True,0,england,italy,11,12,Winter,1901
im pretty mad at france as well after they built a fleet in marseilles,1,True,0,italy,england,11,13,Spring,1902
does that mean youll be moving in,1,True,0,england,italy,11,14,Spring,1902
not sure yet need to see id really like to but sending f nap  to tys also weakens my position in the east a lot,1,,0,italy,england,11,15,Spring,1902
kind of want to see what germany says,1,,0,italy,england,11,16,Spring,1902
it seems that france is a mutual enemy for us,1,True,1,italy,england,11,17,Winter,1902
not sure how much we can coordinate at this stage however,1,True,1,italy,england,11,18,Winter,1902
agreed let’s just give it our best i’m also up against germany and russia seems to be inept,1,True,-1,england,italy,11,19,Spring,1903
you didnt hear this from me but it seems the germanyfrance alliance is breaking down,1,True,1,italy,england,11,20,Winter,1904
it could be a chance for you to play them against each pther,1,True,1,italy,england,11,21,Winter,1904
and how is the mighty sultan today,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,0,Spring,1901
i’m doing great just wrapped up a long weekend at a con how’re you,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,1,Spring,1901
pretty good just finished volunteering with some physically disabled kiddos absolutely unprepared for the mountain of homework im somehow staying on top of what con was it,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,2,Spring,1901
it was “whose turn is it anyway” in durham,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,3,Spring,1901
i think turkey and italy can work together as long as turkey doesn’t build a lot of fleets i would like to not have to build a lot of fleets are you comfortable not putting fleet pressure on me it frees you up for other things  maybe an early go against france or an austrian sandwich,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,4,Spring,1901
a seems like it was great,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,5,Spring,1901
b im fine if you dont want to build fleets it would be interesting and powerful for you if we had a infantrynaval power dynamic but i understand if thats uncomfortable to you i was planning on going all out with naval power but i think our alliance could be really important depending on how things swing so ill accept cutting back,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,6,Spring,1901
greetings from new italy also was scanning the previous messages and noticed you were in durham is that durham england or durham nc,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,7,Spring,1901
but yeah i am largely aligned with the previous players view that turkey and italy can make for a great alliance as long as turkey is more army focused,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,8,Spring,1901
nc  and great to hear,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,9,Spring,1901
where are you from,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,10,Spring,1901
haha i went to school in durham nc,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,11,Spring,1901
ive moved out of the country now though spent the last two years in hong kong and in brussels right now,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,12,Spring,1901
small world haha,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,13,Spring,1901
but yeah gamewise i aim to be pretty defensive year one if i secure tunisia im happy,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,14,Spring,1901
austria has been really cagey with me which probably means they have a plan and im not a part of it might be good news for you or might not depending on whether youve reached an understanding with them or not,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,15,Spring,1901
good to know  i havent set anything in stone with him  i like to send both my armies north as italy everyone wants to talk to me in fall 01 thats for sure,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,16,Spring,1901
out of curiosity how is your relationship with russia i assume the bounce in black sea was prearranged,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,17,Fall,1901
also how is durham these days,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,18,Fall,1901
durham is amazing the city has really gone through a transformation have you played in any european facetoface diplomacy events or are you only an online player,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,19,Fall,1901
black sea was prearranged,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,20,Fall,1901
ok  austria is out of position and only gets one build  would you like to work together and take him down,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,21,Winter,1901
ive played face to face with irl friends but never gone to a face to face event with serious players,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,22,Winter,1901
makes sense that black sea was prearranged  are they on board with occupying it now,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,23,Winter,1901
id be willing in principle to attack austria but want to check what russia has to say as well,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,24,Winter,1901
not sure need to talk with him,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,25,Winter,1901
that was wrt to the black sea bounce,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,26,Winter,1901
yeah fair enough,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,27,Winter,1901
i would be so happy if your fleet went to adriatic this spring  🙂  can we find a peace in the mediterranean,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,28,Winter,1901
russia building in moscow makes me think that he isnt worried about austria  an austriarussia collaboration isnt good for me and it probably isnt the best thing for you in the long run  thoughts,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,29,Spring,1902
agree that i wouldnt want to see a russiaaustria collaboration but not sure if id make too much of it,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,30,Spring,1902
after being kept out of sweden its natural for russia to feel that they need to invest more in the north,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,31,Spring,1902
currently frances fleet marseille is a big headache for me,1,False,0,italy,turkey,11,32,Spring,1902
but if youre willing to support me into greece which would be done by convoy i could follow up by occupying adriatic,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,33,Spring,1902
why dont you convoy into albania,1,False,0,turkey,italy,11,34,Spring,1902
i would like to have a build and greece seems like the likely target,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,35,Spring,1902
im thinking  what do you see as a fair split of austrian dots between us if were going to work together,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,36,Spring,1902
alright  i might be asking for some help into serbia in the fall,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,37,Spring,1902
i would say trieste greece to me and then serbia and budapest  to you you would probably pick up rumania as well in this scenario but need to see how russia plays regarding vienna,0,True,0,italy,turkey,11,38,Spring,1902
let’s do this,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,39,Spring,1902
its come to my understanding that you had no intention of turning on austria this fall  if youre not motivated to attack him and i understand why youd prefer not to go to war with your neighbor when france is playing in your backyard perhaps the three of us can work together and try to force a wedge in the western triple  allow austria and i to focus on russia and you get into a more threatening posture against france,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,40,Fall,1902
i basically sent this to austria ive replaced the pronouns so that it makes sense to you   ok i now realize that theres no western triple  instead its an fg  which is just as bad for you guys since germany is already into russia  heres my idea and take it or leave it  but i suggest that italy keep rotating his fleets out maybe move towards wes and tun while austria backfills ion  italy builds a fleet in rom and austria can convoy greece into nap in the spring  now italys got three fleets in play while france is trying to land a unit on england  meanwhile austria moves the army out of ser and towards munich and i move bulrum north into sev mos and war  its a logical expansion for all of us and presents each of us with room to grow and peace in the balkans,1,,0,turkey,italy,11,41,Fall,1902
you’re really forcing the fleet build i wanted to build armies but you’re forcing the fleet build,1,,0,turkey,italy,11,42,Fall,1902
id like to start by apologizing the turn change comes first thing in the morning my time and your message was sent after i had went to sleep as a result i did not see it until i got off work just now and did not give it proper consideration,1,,0,italy,turkey,11,43,Winter,1902
my alliance with austria against you was based on the premise that you and russia were planning on a juggernaut alliance that needs to be stopped as soon as possible and that your move to the black sea was a concession on russias part to grease the wheels of that alliance,1,,0,italy,turkey,11,44,Winter,1902
your stab on russia in bulgaria has proven those premises to be false yet my move to eas puts us in conflict nonetheless,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,45,Winter,1902
for what its worth i will build a fleet in rome as you had requested  as it is necessary to cover france,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,46,Winter,1902
if you are willing to build an army in con as well i would take that as a strong indicator of your desire for cooperation but would understand if you feel that is not an option for you,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,47,Winter,1902
i think you need an army in venice my friend,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,48,Winter,1902
i’ll consider the army,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,49,Winter,1902
the army in venice is more important for my immediate defensive position but a fleet in rome puts me in a better place to slip through wes and attack france,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,50,Winter,1902
that being said if i felt confident that you would allow me to return to ion building an army in venice would be safer,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,51,Winter,1902
i think that would be mutually beneficial seeing as youre probably not a fan of forcing me to stay in eas either,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,52,Winter,1902
i’m gonna roll the dice and build a con,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,53,Winter,1902
you wont regret it,1,False,0,italy,turkey,11,54,Winter,1902
well i see you got cold feet regarding the a con build,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,55,Spring,1903
cant say i blame you,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,56,Spring,1903
i hope that youll at least let me withdraw to ion,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,57,Spring,1903
certainly,1,,0,turkey,italy,11,58,Spring,1903
ughhh  that was unfortunate  can you effectively defend against both austria and france  any thoughts,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,59,Spring,1903
defensively i can defend against them easily if they are not coordinated if they are i should be able to hold out for some time but it is ultimately a losing battle,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,60,Fall,1903
of course thats assuming that you remain neutral in this  if you pick a side in this conflict either me or austria should be able to cruise to victory,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,61,Fall,1903
i currently have the upper hand against france and dont face any disbands since a greece disbanded anyways but a hostile austria makes it tifficult to commit to gaining ground against france,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,62,Fall,1903
what are your thoughts,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,63,Fall,1903
austria has been a valuable ally for you against russia and can support you into moscow if you were so inclined but germany could do the same  their value to you on that front is reaching its limits,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,64,Fall,1903
i wouldnt be able to support you as much from greece as i was in the past since even if i were to somehow reclaim it it would be with a fleet instead of an army but i would still be willing to put pressure on trieste to help you claim serbiabudapest,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,65,Fall,1903
my thoughts on your comments are  you are correct  i dont plan on attacking you with my fleets,1,True,2,turkey,italy,11,66,Spring,1904
on the other hand i’m not sure i want to attack austria,0,True,2,turkey,italy,11,67,Spring,1904
not sure im a fan of you occupying the ionian,1,True,-2,italy,turkey,11,68,Spring,1904
ill just point out that austria is highly exposed to an attack from you and germany has turned on that,1,True,-2,italy,turkey,11,69,Spring,1904
attacking them would be an easy win,1,,-2,italy,turkey,11,70,Spring,1904
well not easy right now i kept my word to you about not attacking you with my fleets what are your plans with ion,1,True,2,turkey,italy,11,71,Fall,1904
apologies missed this message,1,True,-3,italy,turkey,11,72,Winter,1904
but to be honest given my situation with france and austria i am at your mercy right now,1,True,-3,italy,turkey,11,73,Winter,1904
i have no choice but to offer myself as the junior partner in a italyturkey alliance if you stab me i will rapidly be conquered by france,1,True,-3,italy,turkey,11,74,Winter,1904
that said i believe i still have value as an ally i can help you to keep austrias navy bottled up and help you break through austria and on to germany,1,,-3,italy,turkey,11,75,Winter,1904
i agree  we certainly can and should work together,1,True,3,turkey,italy,11,76,Winter,1904
i think you might make it out of this alive  what is stopping germany from walking into paris this year,1,True,3,turkey,italy,11,77,Spring,1905
not much honestly and germany also told me that theyre ready for a stab on france you didnt hear this from me,1,True,-3,italy,turkey,11,78,Spring,1905
of course ill believe it when i see it but ill do everything i can to encourage that,1,True,-3,italy,turkey,11,79,Spring,1905
apologies for missing the turn,1,True,-2,italy,turkey,11,80,Spring,1906
but would you be willing to support me into the ionian against austria,1,True,-2,italy,turkey,11,81,Spring,1906

fucker needs to go,1,,2,turkey,italy,11,83,Fall,1906
i assume were working together at this point  anything i can do to help,1,,2,turkey,italy,11,84,Winter,1906
not sure if my previous message didnt go through or if you just didnt have a chance to reply,1,True,-2,italy,turkey,11,85,Spring,1907
but just want to reiterate that my goal is a partition of austria  and will move into alb,1,True,-2,italy,turkey,11,86,Spring,1907
new turn is up,1,True,-2,italy,turkey,11,87,Fall,1907
not sure if you didnt see my message or just didnt trust it but it is regrettable that you felt the need to defend greece and lost serbia as a result,1,True,-2,italy,turkey,11,88,Fall,1907
f ion is happy to help you hold greece my draft order is f ion s gre h but let me know if you would prefer something else,1,True,-2,italy,turkey,11,89,Fall,1907
on my end i will do my best to try and take either venice or triste but it might be difficult given the lack of support,1,True,-2,italy,turkey,11,90,Fall,1907
what are your thoughts aiming for bulgaria,1,,-2,italy,turkey,11,91,Fall,1907
yes please support me i greece i will attack bulgaria,1,True,2,turkey,italy,11,92,Fall,1907
will do ill try to play for venicetrieste as well but expect that it wont succeed,1,True,-2,italy,turkey,11,93,Fall,1907
good luck  its probably best to support trieste in and try to slip into venice,1,True,2,turkey,italy,11,94,Fall,1907
in case he tries to selfbounce,1,True,2,turkey,italy,11,95,Fall,1907
i think you need another army,1,True,2,turkey,italy,11,96,Fall,1907
yeah will hope for the selfbounce and aim to snipe,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,97,Winter,1907
was hoping to get germanys assistance but it looks like that wont happen,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,98,Winter,1907
agree that i need another army but will need to secure the build first for that to happen p,1,,-1,italy,turkey,11,99,Winter,1907
bouncing an idea  do you think i should build my army in naples,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,100,Winter,1907
a ven s f alb  tri a ion c a nap  alb would be the fastest way to ramp up the pressure on austria,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,101,Winter,1907
but i wont do it if you dont sign off,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,102,Winter,1907
so if you prefer ill do the more conventional build of a rome,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,103,Winter,1907
actually we need to do something about germany,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,104,Winter,1907
they only need to absorb england and france to win,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,105,Winter,1907
i know  ive been asking austria to do something about germany for a long time,1,True,1,turkey,italy,11,106,Winter,1907
go for naples  i think youre got a good set of moves planned,1,True,1,turkey,italy,11,107,Winter,1907
are you planning to hit serbia again,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,108,Fall,1908
if so do you need my a alb to support,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,109,Fall,1908
how bout i support you in,1,True,1,turkey,italy,11,110,Fall,1908
if you cut adr with ion youll get in  you might even keep trieste,1,True,1,turkey,italy,11,111,Fall,1908
my plan was either alb  ser or have you hit ser to cut support and the ion  adr which should let me hold tri,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,112,Fall,1908
but if youre willing to support me in i would appreciate that as well,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,113,Fall,1908
seems like this turn went well for us,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,114,Fall,1908
and as to the germany issue we can probably grab budapest and then try to snipe vienna next year,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,115,Fall,1908
if we can seize vienna and france holds on to portugal that should be enough to stall germanys victory for a year,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,11,116,Fall,1908
well we managed to break through austria,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,117,Winter,1908
but likely germany will win,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,118,Winter,1908
lets try to coordinate with france and austria to prevent a german victory but might be a lost cause at this point,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,119,Winter,1908
agreed i’m not attacking austria,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,120,Spring,1909
we need to prop up austria that means supporting him to hold in vienna etc,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,121,Spring,1909
austrias move worked beautifully vienna is not currently under threat so i will try to get into tyrolia,1,,0,italy,turkey,11,122,Fall,1909
suggest that you cover sevastapol using a self bounce,1,,0,italy,turkey,11,123,Fall,1909
and then try to use rum to go to galicia,1,,0,italy,turkey,11,124,Fall,1909
i plan to move to ionian  would it be helpful to convoy a greece from there,1,,0,italy,turkey,11,125,Fall,1909
adriatic should support venice to hold,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,126,Fall,1909
and ask for austrian help in tyrol,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,127,Fall,1909
greece is headed north,1,True,0,turkey,italy,11,128,Fall,1909
austria agreed to help,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,129,Fall,1909
makes sense with greece is aegean going to the ionian then,1,True,0,italy,turkey,11,130,Fall,1909
no  no need,1,,0,turkey,italy,11,131,Fall,1909
austria endorsed the below course of action,1,,1,turkey,italy,11,132,Spring,1910
the key to not losing to the solo is  assuming the loss of portugal which is two coin flips  not losing 2 of the 3 russian centers  youre going to lose stp  the question then becomes how to we preserve warsaw  my recommendation is  a vie s tyr  boh a war  ukr a stp  mos a bud  gal i tyr  boh i tri  tyr i ven  pie i tus s ven  pie t sev  ukr t rum s war  ukr t ank  sev convoy  this plan destroys ukr or ensures that we control it  it places units in places that they can cut supports on warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or maintaining it if we dont  chances are if stp is dislodged it will be able to retreat to lvn    worst case is that germany just rotates his armies north  supporting himself into lvn and getting three on warsaw lvn pru and sil  but well either be in moscow or galicia probably both and ukraine  well also have two on munich and he can either keep munich or go after warsaw  the other option is to support ourselves into galicia and ukraine  im willing to do as you suggest,1,,1,turkey,italy,11,133,Spring,1910
you cost us the solo,1,True,1,turkey,italy,11,134,Spring,1910
yeah i messed up,1,,-1,italy,turkey,11,135,Fall,1910
hey friend how goes,1,True,0,italy,france,11,0,Spring,1901
hey italy everything well over here we probably wont be directly involved with eachother until midgame but if were both still around a franceitaly alliance could be pretty strong😉 ,1,False,0,france,italy,11,1,Spring,1901
i also thought i would let you know that i heard from turkeywho i was talking to about attacking russia because we all know how quickly russia can run away with the game that they were planning on attacking you because i think italy is a pretty good player for france to have around im letting you know i dont know how your relationship with austria is but may i suggest a lepanto anyways good luck and have fun,0,True,0,france,italy,11,2,Spring,1901
so i guess your new what do you think about this game the above might still apply but i dont know because turkey might change your mind,0,True,0,france,italy,11,3,Spring,1901
greetings ill talk to turkey again and see if i think it seems true,1,True,0,italy,france,11,4,Spring,1901
agree that early fights between france and italy are often a waste of time for both sides,1,True,0,italy,france,11,5,Spring,1901
suggest we demilitarize piedmont and gulf of tyrolia i wont be too happy if you move to spain sc or build a fleet in piedmont either,1,True,0,italy,france,11,6,Spring,1901
of course i dont think we should be fightingat least this early in the game and that it would be mutually unproductive i agree with a dmz in piedmont and gulf of tyrolia and we might as well extend it to western mediterranean and north africa but i hope you understand how unreasonable for you to expect me not to move the spain as it is a typical france acquisition also i cant build a fleet in piedmont anyways good luck and have fun,1,True,0,france,italy,11,7,Spring,1901
sorry was in a rush to write these since i just entered the game,1,True,0,italy,france,11,8,Fall,1901
let me clarify that i have no issue with you moving to spain  but im a bit uncomfortable with a fleet in spain sc,1,True,0,italy,france,11,9,Fall,1901
i believe spa nc is naturally yours and have no issue with you moving an army there either,1,True,0,italy,france,11,10,Fall,1901
as to the piemdont issue i actually meant marseilles,1,True,0,italy,france,11,11,Fall,1901
but yeah i see that you have made an antiengland opening so we should get along swimmingly,1,True,0,italy,france,11,12,Fall,1901
yes dont worry about a fleet in spain,1,True,0,france,italy,11,13,Fall,1901
how is your relationship with germany,1,True,-2,italy,france,11,14,Winter,1901
pretty solid,1,True,2,france,italy,11,15,Winter,1901
whats with the fleet build in marseilles,1,True,-2,italy,france,11,16,Spring,1902
this stand off in lyotys is a waste of effort for both of us,1,True,-2,italy,france,11,17,Fall,1902
we would mutually benefit from a deescalation,1,True,-2,italy,france,11,18,Fall,1902
while that might be true what would you suggest i do with lyo now if you have a good alternative i would be happy to take it as im not super keen on attacking you anyways,0,True,2,france,italy,11,19,Fall,1902
i can support myself into piedmont and there is nothing stopping me if you dont want me to give me an alternative,1,True,2,france,italy,11,20,Fall,1902
it is very poor faith of you to suggest that your hand was forced in your move to piedmont nobody made you build a f in marseille which can do nothing but attack me in the mediterranean,1,True,-1,italy,france,11,21,Winter,1902
you only managed to get into piedmont because i was worried that you would attempt the more creative and threatening move of convoying into tuscany,1,True,-1,italy,france,11,22,Winter,1902
even now those armies would be far better placed in gascony where they are better placed to convoy to england,1,True,-1,italy,france,11,23,Winter,1902
but to be blunt i dont trust you enough to see much point in talking with you at length,1,True,-1,italy,france,11,24,Winter,1902
lets just see how far your army in piedmont can get in the end,1,True,-1,italy,france,11,25,Winter,1902
austrias build in trieste cannot be anything but a play for venice,1,True,-5,italy,france,11,26,Winter,1904
i am willing to concede it to you if you cooperate elsewhere,0,True,-5,italy,france,11,27,Winter,1904
hmm i messaged austria and they didnt respond what kind of cooperation elswhere do you want if you concede venice,0,True,5,france,italy,11,28,Winter,1904
at this point im at war on too many fronts and i just need to ease the pressure,1,True,-5,italy,france,11,29,Spring,1905
if we demilitarize and i can focus on recapturing greece that would help me a lot,0,True,-5,italy,france,11,30,Spring,1905
ok i didnt think germany would betray me but they did no matter what situation your in we have to all start working together to stop germany or they will win,0,True,5,france,italy,11,31,Spring,1905
sending this to everyone btw,1,True,5,france,italy,11,32,Spring,1905
hello italy,1,True,5,france,italy,11,33,Spring,1905
,1,True,5,france,italy,11,34,Fall,1905
i would require the return of venice as a precondition to any cooperation against germany,1,,-5,italy,france,11,35,Fall,1905
naturally attacking rome or naples would also rule this out,1,,-5,italy,france,11,36,Fall,1905
well i appreciate you pulling out of apulia,1,,-3,italy,france,11,37,Spring,1906
would you be willing to discuss terms regarding venice,1,True,-3,italy,france,11,38,Spring,1906
jeezus,1,True,3,france,italy,11,39,Spring,1906
you have a free path into trieste right now and from there you can pressure vienna,1,True,-3,italy,france,11,40,Spring,1906
after the hiatus whats your view on the current situation,1,,-4,italy,france,11,41,Fall,1907
i view austria as my main adversary and would like to see you hold on to vienna now that austria is occupying venice it also shouldnt make too much of a difference to you whether i take venice or austria does right,1,,-4,italy,france,11,42,Fall,1907
okay,1,,0,italy,france,11,43,Winter,1907
in order to stop germany from winning what support do you need from me,1,,0,italy,france,11,44,Winter,1907
seems the game has conspired to make us natural allies once again,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,0,Spring,1901
how’s that,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,1,Spring,1901
oh you know austria germany its generally considered suicide to go after each other,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,2,Spring,1901
and yes i’m always happier as austria when germany lets people know that we are allies,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,3,Spring,1901
you said once again though,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,4,Spring,1901
oh well you were italy in game 9 yes,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,5,Spring,1901
how’d you figure that out,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,6,Spring,1901
well youre the only one that was in both games and both discord channels process of elimination,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,7,Spring,1901
gotcha hahaha,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,8,Spring,1901
hopefully it isn’t an issue with the study that we figured it out,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,9,Spring,1901
well they did say that anonymity was optional,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,10,Spring,1901
sounds good,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,11,Spring,1901
so what’re you seeing from the board so far,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,12,Spring,1901
russia hasnt spoken much but enough for me to know that they arent my enemy italy is maintaining friendly terms with me and the french seem pretty insistent that we can be allies as well i think that if all is as it seems the corner powers turks and english are the most in trouble at the moment,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,13,Spring,1901
this is of course barring treachery,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,14,Spring,1901
i’d assume you will be trying to recruit france to go for england then,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,15,Spring,1901
thats the hope yes,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,16,Spring,1901
this group doesn’t seem very chatty,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,17,Spring,1901
certainly doesnt might be easier to go outside and squeeze trees for sap,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,18,Spring,1901
the italians are eying you up as a potential enemy,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,19,Spring,1901
everything proceeds according to plan thusfar,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,20,Fall,1901
can you do me a favor and bounce russia in swe since they tried to hit gal and i’ll try to talk to italy because i don’t really wanna fight them,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,21,Fall,1901
ill try talking to the russians first but if i think theyre lying to me or if they refuse ill bounce them,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,22,Fall,1901
actually nevermind im not going to speak with them ill just bounce them you can count on at least one army coming your direction to help with them after this season,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,23,Fall,1901
looks like theyre going to try a juggernaut i may have to alter my western triple plans accordingly,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,24,Fall,1901
ouch i was going to ask turkey to support me into rum for a take or a bounce either way it would hold russia from building,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,25,Fall,1901
thanks for the heads up we will see what turkey says,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,26,Fall,1901
yeah the russians and turks seem to have arranged that bounce for the black sea while the russians maneuvered south they want us to think that theyre not friends until the moment they start supporting each other around ill talk to the russians and turks to see if i can squeeze some info out of them eh,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,27,Fall,1901
sounds good i’m trying to smooth things out with italy right now,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,28,Fall,1901
i’ll talk to england and let you know if i hear anything,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,29,Fall,1901
the english and i are for the time being on good terms but any wild cards you could find out for me would be appreciated,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,30,Fall,1901
reached out to france as well so i will let you know looks like they might fight so that will be a fun situation for you,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,31,Fall,1901
yeah the triples going ideally for me thank goodness,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,32,Fall,1901
did you actually hear from someone that a juggernaut is happening or did you just get that from reading the board,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,33,Fall,1901
just a hunch from reading the board,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,34,Fall,1901
because if i move into rum thinking turkey will support and they don’t and move into gre instead then i am in bad shape,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,35,Fall,1901
but if the move works then russia doesn’t get a build,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,36,Fall,1901
can you try and approach turkey and get some info not sure if they’d believe you’re attempting an attack on me but it could work,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,37,Fall,1901
ive done so but they have yet to respond,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,38,Fall,1901
tight lipped this whole group,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,39,Fall,1901
how frustrating,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,40,Fall,1901
incredibly,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,41,Fall,1901
yeah hearing from turkey that italy doesn’t love me either so i have to watch out for that,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,42,Fall,1901
he told me not to trust you but i don’t know how you would really attack me so,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,43,Fall,1901
turkeys trying to push you away from those who might come to your aid earnestly if he hasnt mentioned russia then thats more evidence that the two of them are cooperating,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,44,Fall,1901
makes sense i’ll probably have to play conservatively,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,45,Fall,1901
god im a fucking idiot ugh i accidentally sent a message intended for the english to the french and the way its worded makes me look sus as fuck,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,46,Fall,1901
worst case scenario here is that this is literally the turning point where all my planning goes down the drain and the two who were about to fuckin duke it out turn into an entente fuck fuck,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,47,Fall,1901
that’s not good i’m sorry man england and i just started talking anything you would want me to sayget from him,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,48,Fall,1901
,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,49,Fall,1901
nothing much i already got pretty much everything i need out of them,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,50,Fall,1901
though if you could unsuspiciously ask them if they have some kind of plan regarding france or i thatd be very useful,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,51,Fall,1901
ok so i think the french might just think im an idiot now which is a far better outcome than i could have possibly hoped for all things considered if anything thats better than the status quo before because they wont think im smart enough to betray them competently,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,52,Fall,1901
russia just confirmed its a juggernaut,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,53,Fall,1901
that’s unfortunate,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,54,Fall,1901
thank you for checking on that i’ll poke around with england,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,55,Fall,1901
ill be mobilizing forces east hopefully the russians will be too busy with me to keep the turks alive,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,56,Fall,1901
hopefully italy stays with me,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,57,Fall,1901
theyd have to be fools not to,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,58,Fall,1901
yeah i’ve talked with him a little and he agrees that a strong turkey will eventually be bad for him,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,59,Fall,1901
good hopefully hell maintain that opinion,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,60,Fall,1901
howd you swindle the russians into staying put this time,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,61,Winter,1901
i didn’t know they’d do that never asked them to,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,62,Winter,1901
glad i guessed right on turkey he’s still acting like we could be allies and is apologizing for not notifying me of his change of plans he told me that he didn’t support me into rum because russia agreed to bounce in bla again so i wouldn’t need the support to bounce so he’s claiming to be angry at russia,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,63,Winter,1901
thats a good joke that basically confirms it though even if it werent already theyre working together,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,64,Winter,1901
yes,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,65,Winter,1901
lol especially with that fleet build,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,66,Spring,1902
what’s the situation out west,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,67,Spring,1902
sorry for not responding busy weekend but apparently the british have caught onto my tricks the french and i are allied though the italians should be able to prove distracting enough that france wont be able to roll over me once britains gone though,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,68,Fall,1902
whats the plan with you we can effectively guarantee that warsaw falls but i cant hold sweden and vienna is terribly exposed,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,69,Fall,1902
also either the russians and turks are doing a more convincing act than i did last game or the juggernaut has fallen apart,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,70,Fall,1902
yeah i didn’t believe that turkey wanted to go against russia but it looks like he actually does,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,71,Fall,1902
not sure about my plan i have to look at the board i will get back to you,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,72,Fall,1902
i think i will be able to hold all of my supply centers,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,73,Fall,1902
are you gonna support me into gal in order to guarantee that war falls,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,74,Fall,1902
wouldnt displacing gal just give the russians vienna for free basically,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,75,Fall,1902
i meant support gal into war my bad,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,76,Fall,1902
geez ukr into gal,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,77,Fall,1902
oh my gosh,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,78,Fall,1902
ukr into war final answer,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,79,Fall,1902
i was really hoping to secure warsaw for myself truth be told unless you intend to stay friends with the turks once russias finished off but then again im not under any specific threat so i suppose you can have it,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,80,Fall,1902
do you want both of mine supporting or is one free to maneuver,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,81,Fall,1902
my only reasoning behind you supporting me in is that it guarantees we take it even if he supports it holding with gal they only way for this to 100 work is both of yours supporting me in,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,82,Fall,1902
because i can’t hit gal this turn i have to cover my own ass,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,83,Fall,1902
silesia being the one to move would also render a 100 success rate that fleet in sev cant cut ukraine and prissoa isnt under threat,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,84,Fall,1902
prussia,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,85,Fall,1902
you’re right rough morning for me apparently i’ll support you in you’re doing more of the work,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,86,Fall,1902
alright from there moscow is yours ill take st petersburg and sweden and youll take romania and sevastopol as well as of course whatever you can get off the turks,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,87,Fall,1902
hopefully it all actually works out that way it’s gonna be messy over here if me turkey and russia all can’t trust each other,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,88,Fall,1902
its already messy all over hopefully it ends in our favor,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,89,Fall,1902
once again i feel like allying with you is the best move because you talk more than anyone else hahaha,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,90,Fall,1902
yeah literally nobody aside from you has responded for like 24 hours,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,91,Fall,1902
it makes it very hard to build alliances i realize people have jobs and stuff but still it’s hard,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,92,Fall,1902
yeah not sure what it is,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,93,Fall,1902
lmk when you have time to talk,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,94,Fall,1902
ive got time right now btw the turks just came to me asking if i was interested in attacking you,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,95,Fall,1902
okay he’s a confusing player i think i need to trust him short term but keep an eye on him,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,96,Fall,1902
well he also just said that if the two of you can get on the same page russias done for so i think he wants to give it another shot,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,97,Fall,1902
yeah he does may have been reaching out to you because he is iffy on me,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,98,Fall,1902
he’s worried about you and france,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,99,Fall,1902
i mean shit im worried about me and france too our position as friends is tenuous at best if you ask me,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,100,Fall,1902
😂,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,101,Fall,1902
and they barely fuckin talk,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,102,Fall,1902
i need to know if im moving into the north sea or not damnit,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,103,Fall,1902
what is your stance on me taking war,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,104,Fall,1902
like how opposed are you because i understand that you could risk it and try and just take it your self,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,105,Fall,1902
im not terribly opposed but me taking it would have us in better position to take moscow if you ask me assuming that ukraine isnt displaced,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,106,Fall,1902
that’s true to be honest my reasoning is that turkey is freaking out about you and if i support you in i might lose him for good for that reason he wants me to cut support in sev so that he can take rum or attack mos to either take that or bounce it i don’t wanna do either of those things so i thought if you support me in then you are happy because russia loses a center turkey is happy because you don’t gain one and i am happy because i gain one,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,107,Fall,1902
however your reason for being happy isn’t as convincing as ours,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,108,Fall,1902
well the real problem in any case is that if you get too buddy buddy with the turks the italians lose a lot of incentive to be your ally and gain a lot of incentive to hit you while your backs turned,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,109,Fall,1902
and the turks honestly dont have more than a tenuous and temporary reason to be your friend either,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,110,Fall,1902
totally understand that i don’t want to be allied with the turks but warring them and russia at the same time is a pain in the ass i’m convinced that they are against russia and will help me until they know russia will go down which could very well only be this fall or fall and spring,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,111,Fall,1902
yeah once the russians lose warsaw theyre on the ropes and have very little chance of stopping us and the balkans are pretty well tied up in any case as long as the italians remain dedicated,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,112,Fall,1902
i am still talking to italy and would have no issues with them attacking turkey i just don’t want turkey attacking me as for an italian stab they are now in a position where attacking me is a multi turn process that i would see coming,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,113,Fall,1902
true unless they build in venice,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,114,Fall,1902
fair still not that worried about italy though i would definitely trust them more than turkey,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,115,Fall,1902
same and with france breathing down their necks theyre unlikely to consider treachery,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,116,Fall,1902
so what are your final thoughts on my proposal,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,117,Fall,1902
if you don’t like it you don’t need to lie to me but i feel like it’s a solid compromise,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,118,Fall,1902
i would certainly prefer having warsaw myself and eventually i would prefer to get it from you but if you think that itd be better for you to have it i will support that,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,119,Fall,1902
i am not against an eventual transfer as long as it would not result in a disband,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,120,Fall,1902
of course it would be in a season where youd made gains,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,121,Fall,1902
so yes you will support,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,122,Fall,1902
i will,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,123,Fall,1902
thank you owe you one,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,124,Fall,1902
alright the turkishrussian alliance is pretty thoroughly ruined at this point think its safe to double down with the italians to crush them now,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,125,Fall,1902
fair thank you for actually sending me into war we might even be able to do a transfer this spring,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,126,Fall,1902
though if you told  the italians that you were moving on bulgaria they might be understandably miffed to have missed that opportunity,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,127,Fall,1902
that would be really nice i could really use the units,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,128,Fall,1902
no i didn’t tell them that,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,129,Fall,1902
ill be able to use my new one to push back russia,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,130,Fall,1902
well pushing back russia isnt really the concern anymore theyre going to have to disband the real concern now needs to be curbing the turks before they gain enough momentum on you two,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,131,Fall,1902
the russians are all kinds of out of position to boot,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,132,Fall,1902
yeah plus they have zero allies,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,133,Fall,1902
unless you count the british but they made no attempt to help out this time,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,134,Fall,1902
so france is going full split fronts how’re you feeling about getting through england,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,135,Winter,1902
itll be slow but as soon as russias dispatched properly the british wont be able to stop me hammering through them,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,136,Winter,1902
i’m trying to figure out if i wanna convince italy to lay off of turkey,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,137,Winter,1902
alright so warsaw can support do what it likes but helping me into livonia would be pretty ideal,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,138,Spring,1903
yeah i’ll do that but you need to support war holding then with sil,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,139,Spring,1903
thats the plan,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,140,Spring,1903
what do you think russia will do with gal this turn lol such a wild card,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,141,Spring,1903
i could see him movingretreating into boh just to make my life difficult,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,142,Spring,1903
my bets that hell pull it back to ukraine try to survive rather than just cause trouble,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,143,Spring,1903
hopefully,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,144,Spring,1903
i’m gonna reach out to england about seeing if they would take st p even though it would be selfish and short sighted of him it might be enticing enough for him to do it,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,145,Spring,1903
we could already take it away later england is rarely able to hold russian territories,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,146,Spring,1903
always,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,147,Spring,1903
it would be good intel for france and i as well to see if we can afford to get aggressive with our fleets,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,148,Spring,1903
i’ll let you know if he even responds,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,149,Spring,1903
are you hitting bot this turn i think you should,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,150,Spring,1903
yeah want to force the russians to have to retreat with the fleet so i can jump into sweden,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,151,Spring,1903
okay cool,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,152,Spring,1903
any chance you could approach turkey about attacking me once russia is done i don’t trust that i’m not his next expansion target,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,153,Spring,1903
i would do the same for you if you would like,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,154,Spring,1903
i already have gotten several messages from them asking if im interested in attacking you which is why ive been warning you that they could go after you at any moment and you shouldnt trust them,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,155,Spring,1903
how recently,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,156,Spring,1903
monday i can check again if youd like but in any case siding with the turks is a suckers bet for you once russias gone they have nowhere to expand and theyre at your back and siding with them will rapidly erode italys willingness to side with you,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,157,Spring,1903
interested to see if russia has actually quit,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,158,Spring,1903
same turks have yet to respond to me seeing how interested they are in betraying you,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,159,Spring,1903
haven’t talked to me yet either,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,160,Spring,1903
do you think taking gre was a bad move,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,161,Spring,1903
well you can count on italy not being fans of the move,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,162,Spring,1903
turkeys starting to respond their biggest question so far is how we would split you eastwest or northsouth,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,163,Spring,1903
i personally wouldnt have done it you need the italians to keep the french off your border and to help if the turks decide to take you down andthe turks have no reason not to want you dead if the opportunity arises you dont need them for russia anymore so who do you need them for what do they need you for furthermore where can they go now to expand,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,164,Spring,1903
yeah i’m just going to have to anticipate the stab honestly i was tired of working with italy he was constantly reading the board poorly saw france coming and mishandled it and other stuff,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,165,Spring,1903
alright move into moscow and ill get into warsaw seems like a good time to do the transfer,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,166,Fall,1903
just don’t support yourself into war because i might not make it into mos,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,167,Fall,1903
lol england wants me to attack you,1,True,0,austria,germany,11,168,Fall,1903
have the turks support you in and they cant block you also i think england might be desperate lol,1,True,0,germany,austria,11,169,Fall,1903
how goes there,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,170,Spring,1904
nervous part of the game for me,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,171,Spring,1904
not in love with turkeys army build,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,172,Spring,1904
have you talked with france about their tyr move,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,173,Spring,1904
yeah its an italycentric move they mean you no harm as far as im aware,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,174,Spring,1904
they havent been very talkative since friday though so its hard to say,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,175,Spring,1904
i’m assuming you’re responding to the france thing and not the turkey thing,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,176,Spring,1904
yeah the turkey thing can really only go one way,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,177,Spring,1904
he says he’s convoying it to apu seems legit and if he moves it to bul instead i will see it coming,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,178,Spring,1904
i need to figure out what direction i wanna go now,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,179,Spring,1904
not to sound like a broken clock or anything but turkeys got very little option but to fight you at this point thats a pretty good direction to point yourself,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,180,Spring,1904
neither of us are in a position for it right now though,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,181,Spring,1904
so what are you gonna do you committed a lot of stuff east that isn’t very useful anymore,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,182,Spring,1904
well probably going to finish off the brits then im not sure honestly,0,True,1,germany,austria,11,183,Spring,1904
that’s fair do you buy that turkey is moving con to apu,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,184,Spring,1904
personally not really but its possible,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,185,Spring,1904
my only holdup with it is that he could have just built the army in smy then,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,186,Spring,1904
exactly,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,187,Spring,1904
gonna see if france is willing to talk will let you know what he says about you,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,188,Spring,1904
if he says anything,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,189,Spring,1904
he hasnt spoken to me in a while not sure whats up,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,190,Spring,1904
yeah i’m gonna at least try and figure out some italy stuff,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,191,Spring,1904
you can take st p but can you hit ukr for me,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,192,Fall,1904
can do told you the turks were no good,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,193,Fall,1904
glad that i moved against them,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,194,Fall,1904
yeah things are about to get reeeeal hectic over there not sure how much i can help,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,195,Fall,1904
me either i’m honestly not sure i can win,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,196,Fall,1904
it might be possible if you reconcile with the italians and help them push off the french,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,197,Fall,1904
it would at the very least become a lot more likely turkish naval supremacy makes things immensely difficult for you,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,198,Fall,1904
im all in on your side here but my navys on the other side of the map and armies can only touch turkey and shore you up if i enter your personal space so to speak,1,True,1,germany,austria,11,199,Fall,1904
ya i don’t know how much you can do right now,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,200,Fall,1904
i’d be fine with you trying to get into position to be,1,True,-1,austria,germany,11,201,Fall,1904
what do you need from warsaw,1,True,3,germany,austria,11,202,Spring,1905
can you support rum to ukr and can you support mos h,1,True,-3,austria,germany,11,203,Spring,1905
what kind of win are you thinking you probably won’t be able to solo unless you take out france soon,1,True,-3,austria,germany,11,204,Spring,1905
no idea probably some form of draw but its hard to say who all would be involved at this point,1,False,3,germany,austria,11,205,Spring,1905
and yes i can do that,1,False,3,germany,austria,11,206,Spring,1905
everything good,1,True,-3,austria,germany,11,207,Spring,1905
yup yup everythings good over here,1,True,3,germany,austria,11,208,Spring,1905
the heck are the turks up to even,1,True,3,germany,austria,11,209,Spring,1905
ugh i feel like a jerk putting the knife in frances back this hard feels way worse than what i did to the turks last time,1,True,3,germany,austria,11,210,Spring,1905
turkey thought we had an alliance but the last time we talked he said he was attacking me until we figured it out we never talked because i was a little in active i didn’t reach out until last night so i had to put in orders against him he trusted me blindly,1,True,-3,austria,germany,11,211,Spring,1905
france is bummed just sent us a mass message to attack you,1,True,-3,austria,germany,11,212,Spring,1905
well i hope that you wont that would put a damper on things,1,True,3,germany,austria,11,213,Spring,1905
haha yes it would,1,True,-3,austria,germany,11,214,Spring,1905
there is no way that i can no way turkey doesn’t attack me for the rest of the game now,0,True,-3,austria,germany,11,215,Spring,1905
yeah you really kinda have to get rid if them if you want to go forward with anything else,1,True,3,germany,austria,11,216,Spring,1905
good to see that turkey is progressing well if the french disband in tyrolia would you mind if i jump in id like to hasten their demise by denying them venice  if possible,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,217,Winter,1905
denying who venice,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,218,Winter,1905
the french of course,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,219,Winter,1905
gotcha,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,220,Winter,1905
well moot anyways i suppose theyre staying put it seems how goes turkey,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,221,Spring,1906
eh,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,222,Spring,1906
i really haven’t enjoyed this game austria is my least favorite country,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,223,Spring,1906
i like austria honestly generally if you lose its very early and it requires good communication,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,224,Spring,1906
with any luck the game will be over soon enough anyways the french really have no recourse here,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,225,Spring,1906
soon as you take out the turks and the italians we can end it and the turks are definitely on the ropes,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,226,Spring,1906
if you had more troops this direction id suggest we could work together to displace tyrolia with one of your armies but youd have to cover trieste and turkey could easily take advantage of that in the current state,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,227,Spring,1906
are you saying two way,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,228,Spring,1906
unless you can think of anyone else who wed include,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,229,Spring,1906
i thought you would go solo,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,230,Spring,1906
why would i do that,0,True,4,germany,austria,11,231,Spring,1906
lol because you probably can,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,232,Spring,1906
i mean i probably could have last time too if i hadnt spent half the game with 6 armies sitting around doing nothing lol,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,233,Spring,1906
fair well i’d be happy to be included,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,234,Spring,1906
outstanding prediction on that french move if that wasnt a coincidence,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,235,Fall,1906
haha thanks yeah it was a guess,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,236,Fall,1906
now i have to guess right again,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,237,Fall,1906
if the italians were more enthusiastic revanchists this would be easier i kinda wish you hadnt moved into ionian it really spooked them,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,238,Fall,1906
they hate me anyways,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,239,Fall,1906
no offense but that is mostly on you,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,240,Fall,1906
oh of course,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,241,Fall,1906
i’m terrible with austria i freak out and don’t trust anyone,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,242,Fall,1906
everyone on the board except you hates me,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,243,Fall,1906
cant imagine why the french would but apparantly they want to pick fights with you too now,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,244,Fall,1906
for me the problem country is italy can never get the hang of it,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,245,Fall,1906
tbf i cant even really talk the british are being extremely uncooperative because of my previous action against them,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,246,Fall,1906
i actually like italy as you know i try as hard as i can to ally with russia if i can’t get that then usually turkey will attack austria with me,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,247,Fall,1906
yeah italys really one where you have to go with the russians or get really unorthodox the generally accepted path is kinda crap,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,248,Fall,1906
most italians just start a fight with austria without reaching out to other people that’s the issue,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,249,Fall,1906
i suppose its another one that requires really good coordination i can never convince the french it isnt worth it though,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,250,Fall,1906
as italy,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,251,Fall,1906
these games through the study are the only ones i have ever really played where france goes for italy i don’t know if it’s because players are more experienced here or just a coincidence,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,252,Fall,1906
not sure ive seen it fairly frequently,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,253,Fall,1906
usually france is busy freaking out about eg in my games,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,254,Fall,1906
in games im in england and france are generally the ones fucking germany over,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,255,Fall,1906
i always feel like that goes poorly for england,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,256,Fall,1906
depends if france is the kind of fool that doesnt build fleets,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,257,Fall,1906
true,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,258,Fall,1906
would you like me to come down and help expel the french i can mobilize munich and warsaw to the task it would involve moving into bohemia and tyrolia but drastic times call for drastic measures,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,259,Fall,1906
yeah i’d appreciate it,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,260,Fall,1906
not a good turn for me i made some bad guesses,1,True,-4,austria,germany,11,261,Fall,1906
no worries ill come down to help out,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,262,Fall,1906
so i just realized that my mind made a goof and warsaw doesnt border bohemia would you mind terribly if i moved into galicia to help ensure you can expel the french from there we can mutually bounce in budapest while displacing venice assuming that you dont successfully occupy budapest in spring youll need to hold budapest on your own power for the first turn though,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,263,Fall,1906
also if you retreat to the adriatic you can take venice uncontested,1,True,4,germany,austria,11,264,Fall,1906
yeah do what you need but obviously we will continue to coordinate,1,True,-5,austria,germany,11,265,Winter,1906
i feel like im screwed,1,True,-5,austria,germany,11,266,Spring,1907
well things could certainly be better all things considered,1,True,5,germany,austria,11,267,Spring,1907
oh hey everything went great situation normal,1,True,5,germany,austria,11,268,Fall,1907
do you think itd be a good idea for me to temporarily occupy vienna to deprive the french of the dot or would you be uncomfortable with that you think,1,True,5,germany,austria,11,269,Fall,1907
i mean it’s not mine right now go for it,1,True,-5,austria,germany,11,270,Fall,1907
if i could get in it would be a different story,1,True,-5,austria,germany,11,271,Fall,1907
fair enough just wanted to get your approval first,1,True,5,germany,austria,11,272,Fall,1907
highly unexpected move from the turks there though it does leave them open to an attack through armenia,1,True,7,germany,austria,11,273,Winter,1907
im vacating vienna for you to move in ill be moving to galicia and back to warsaw from there,1,True,7,germany,austria,11,274,Spring,1908
yeah you have to because of that french unit he’s annoyingly,1,True,-7,austria,germany,11,275,Spring,1908
incredibly hes sacrificing his ability to hang on to territory in favor of being a thorn in our mutual side,1,True,7,germany,austria,11,276,Spring,1908
turkey is getting on my nerves keeps just yelling at me lol,1,True,-7,austria,germany,11,277,Fall,1908
he says i’m letting you win honestly all my chips are on us doing a two way i can’t stop you so i might as well hope you wanna win together lol,1,True,-7,austria,germany,11,278,Fall,1908
i sure would love to but at this point im not sure its possible these games are limited to year 10 and thats rapidly approaching i dont think we can make up the lost ground for you even if they all post four noorders turns,1,True,7,germany,austria,11,279,Fall,1908
theres basically only two ways for this to finish four way draw and german victory i hate to say it and i wont suggest one over the other to you but i think it should be clear which id greatly prefer,1,True,7,germany,austria,11,280,Fall,1908
ya plus i just messed up,1,True,-7,austria,germany,11,281,Fall,1908
yeah even if this kept going after year ten that would be a terrible setback,1,True,7,germany,austria,11,282,Fall,1908
honesty not quite the best policy on this one eh in any case i understand,1,True,14,germany,austria,11,283,Spring,1909
lol i kinda just figured fuck it,1,True,-14,austria,germany,11,284,Spring,1909
well well see if you can stop me 😉,1,True,14,germany,austria,11,285,Spring,1909
hahhaa yeah definitely going to,1,True,-14,austria,germany,11,286,Fall,1909
definitely going to stop me or definitely going to see,1,True,14,germany,austria,11,287,Fall,1909
lol we’ll see i doubt we can stop you at this point,1,True,-14,austria,germany,11,288,Fall,1909
gonna be real id give it 5050 odds theres only 3 more turns and it could go either way depending on how you four move,1,True,14,germany,austria,11,289,Fall,1909
hello and good evening you and i have much to talk about and if we dont get certain things sorted out and understood between us im afraid that any conflict that might arise would surely sink us both  first things first i would greatly prefer if we could keep  silesia and prussia demilitarized as well as bohemia should such a situation arise,1,True,-1,germany,russia,11,0,Spring,1901
hi hello i agree theres no need to start a ruckus on the eastern front truce on those three for now where are you looking to head first,1,True,1,russia,germany,11,1,Spring,1901
the british are an existential threat to anyone with a border on the atlantic id prefer to dispatch them first and foremost,1,True,-1,germany,russia,11,2,Spring,1901
agreed  ill be in swe you take den for now,1,True,1,russia,germany,11,3,Spring,1901
thats the plan though in the future after the british are gone id very much like to make sweden and denmark demilitarized as well,1,,-1,germany,russia,11,4,Spring,1901
its obviously too dangerous for the time being,1,,-1,germany,russia,11,5,Spring,1901
aint no england ever send both fleets east that wasnt aiming to take on the russians in my experience,1,,-1,germany,russia,11,6,Fall,1901
also you working with the turks i can help hasten austrias demise if you are,0,,-1,germany,russia,11,7,Fall,1901
thanks appreciate it can you let me scooch into swe,1,True,1,russia,germany,11,8,Fall,1901
of course can i get vienna,0,,-1,germany,russia,11,9,Fall,1901
danke and sure thing,1,True,1,russia,germany,11,10,Fall,1901
is sweden a lost cause for me,1,True,0,russia,germany,11,11,Spring,1902
alliance with england is a lose for you in the long run,1,False,0,russia,germany,11,12,Spring,1902
i am so friggin sorry i was toying around with my orders for a while the other day before the turn in and apparently never clicked update on the finalized version xx im a complete mess this game you can just ask france,0,False,0,germany,russia,11,13,Spring,1902
never trust the germans they told me,1,True,0,russia,germany,11,14,Spring,1902
well thats france of course they would tell you that p but seriously it was just me being a goofy lil bitch and not hitting the buttons correctly when i needed to,0,False,0,germany,russia,11,15,Spring,1902
so much for dmz,1,True,0,russia,germany,11,16,Fall,1902
really looked like yall were going for a juggernaut theres certain circumstances that necessitate the breaking of even the most earnest promise,1,False,0,germany,russia,11,17,Fall,1902
youve done me dirty on literally every single turn,1,True,0,russia,germany,11,18,Fall,1902
only 23 of them,1,True,0,germany,russia,11,19,Fall,1902
according to meatloaf thats not bad,1,False,0,germany,russia,11,20,Fall,1902
genuinely curious why youre not moving south though,1,True,0,russia,germany,11,21,Fall,1902
because austrias no threat to me,1,,0,germany,russia,11,22,Fall,1902
good afternoon to you england i think its important that you and i talk about things like belgium and perhaps other situations as you see fit right here at the start,1,True,0,germany,england,11,0,Spring,1901
agreed  what would you like to see happen in belgium what are your thoughts on bouncing russia  im open to many possibilities,1,True,0,england,germany,11,1,Spring,1901
well i personally would quite like to have belgiun but im willing to listen to reasons why i shouldnt get it,1,True,0,germany,england,11,2,Spring,1901
i think that depends on the russia question,1,True,0,england,germany,11,3,Spring,1901
it certainly does russia hasnt communicated with me yet im starting to think that they dont even want to be my friend,1,False,0,germany,england,11,4,Spring,1901
well considering frances opening i’d say you and i can work well against france i’ve already discussed with italy putting some pressure on piedmont and the med what do you up say you game for a eg sweep,1,True,0,england,germany,11,5,Fall,1901
right that opening is particularly aggressive im guessing that theyre mostly doing it to try and keep you out of belgium but in any case it signals that they dont want to be your friend either im guessing youll move back to london,1,True,0,germany,england,11,6,Fall,1901
it seems i have no choice  what has your communication with france been like,1,True,0,england,germany,11,7,Fall,1901
its been pretty limited made some agreements regarding belgium but aside from that theyve been cagey,1,False,0,germany,england,11,8,Fall,1901
well you youll be getting 3 builds  i would appreciate armys over fleets to help go after france if possibe  you think thats in the cards,1,True,0,england,germany,11,9,Fall,1901
well be honest with you the agreement was that they would have belgium so if you want you can successfully bounce them there since going from the english channel is the only means of doing so,1,True,0,germany,england,11,10,Fall,1901
i dont trust the french not to try to play me for a patsy and youre far more communicative anyways might as well tell you stuff thatll give you the upper hand,0,True,0,germany,england,11,11,Fall,1901
by the way the russians are doing some really sus stuff you wouldnt happen to be friendly with them would you,1,True,0,germany,england,11,12,Fall,1901
on second thought the fact that the french dont feel trustworthy means that theyre probably lying when they say theyll move to belgium i dunno take it how you will,0,True,0,germany,england,11,13,Fall,1901
russia is not very happy with my double fleet east so i haven’t gotten much from him i’m hearing rumors of an early jug forming,1,True,0,england,germany,11,14,Fall,1901
france stabbed me out the gate we had a dmz in the channel i’m wary of trusting him i hope you make a play at belgium,1,True,0,england,germany,11,15,Fall,1901
i can read a juggernaut when its happening this is definitely one of them russia wouldnt be going after the austrians otherwise you mind supporting me into sweden in the spring we need to head that eventuality off at the pass by all means necessary,1,True,0,germany,england,11,16,Fall,1901
hello,1,True,1,germany,england,11,17,Spring,1902
mean but not unexpected,1,True,1,germany,england,11,18,Fall,1902
you’re in tight with france and i haven’t seen anything to make me think otherwise unfortunate that russia messed up i hope we can work together against france i can make a great ally,1,False,-1,england,germany,11,19,Fall,1902
look man the french have been pretty agreeable so far so im staying out of their way for the most part im just trying to focus on the russians and keep enough in the west that i cant be easily taken by surprise to be honest,0,True,1,germany,england,11,20,Fall,1902
supporting france into the north sea is something i think you might regret,1,True,-4,england,germany,11,21,Fall,1904
i dont see france getting out of the north and will be looming on you throughout the game,1,True,-4,england,germany,11,22,Fall,1904
with you getting builds and france getting nothing this might be as good a time as any to stab,1,True,-4,england,germany,11,23,Fall,1904
you know i was thinking the exact same thing,1,True,4,germany,england,11,24,Fall,1904
munbur holbel den support helnth,1,True,-4,england,germany,11,25,Fall,1904
lets work together,1,True,-4,england,germany,11,26,Fall,1904
well the question is at this point with me having mistreated you thusfar what incentive do i have to trust you not to do something squirrely instead of working with me no offense meant or anything,1,True,4,germany,england,11,27,Fall,1904
none taken  im only looking for survival  i was double stabbed by france and you so its not like im trying to single you out  if i have any shot of staying on the board its to convince you to stab france and maintain my island  i dont think theres anything gained other than spite by messing with you and that also means i ultimatley die off,1,True,-4,england,germany,11,28,Fall,1904
i only ask because your best shot by far if you asked me is if you get me to betray france but at the same time you take a supply center from me so that you keep all your pieces and at the same time throw a wrench in my betrayal so that france and i will be on roughly equal footing while at each others throats bonus points if youre also relaying the plans of betrayal to the french so that they can be countered  after all if i win outright youve only delayed the inevitable havent you better to make it messy,1,True,4,germany,england,11,29,Fall,1904
but im willing to throw you a bone i wont tell you what im going to do with my units in detail but i will support you into the north sea,1,True,4,germany,england,11,30,Fall,1904
i have no way of taking you down a sc  my fleet in hel could take kiel but you can cover with ber and either you get bel or i bounce hol  either way youre still up because of norway  either way i hope we get to work together,1,True,-4,england,germany,11,31,Fall,1904
😔,1,True,-7,england,germany,11,32,Winter,1904
i forgot to submit those orders fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck,1,False,7,germany,england,11,33,Winter,1904
i can do it this next year theres still time for you yet,1,False,7,germany,england,11,34,Winter,1904
im disbanding now because you took norway,1,True,-7,england,germany,11,35,Winter,1904
yuuuuup,1,,7,germany,england,11,36,Winter,1904
hopefully the french are sufficiently distracted that you can launch a counter attack,1,False,7,germany,england,11,37,Spring,1905
how can i do that,1,True,-7,england,germany,11,38,Fall,1905
while theyre pulling back,1,True,7,germany,england,11,39,Fall,1905
see,1,True,7,germany,england,11,40,Fall,1905
so i assume that you will be moving toward london now,1,True,9,germany,england,11,41,Spring,1906
of course  gotta get my home centers,1,True,-9,england,germany,11,42,Spring,1906
well that was incredibly inconvenient of you,1,True,9,germany,england,11,43,Fall,1906
what do you want me to do,1,True,-9,england,germany,11,44,Fall,1906
stop trying to take north sea youre slowing the entire war down,1,,9,germany,england,11,45,Fall,1906
id go so far as to say youre the reason the french are going to get a build,1,,9,germany,england,11,46,Fall,1906
you could have gone to wales and liverpool last turn and had london in the bag but nooooooo youre just so thirsty for the north sea that now youre being used as a pawn by the french,1,True,9,germany,england,11,47,Fall,1906
yorkshire now liverpool you get the point,1,True,9,germany,england,11,48,Fall,1906
not ugh,1,True,9,germany,england,11,49,Fall,1906
thats pretty self righteous speech for someone who stabbed me twice,1,True,-9,england,germany,11,50,Fall,1906
you moved against me at the same time i moved against you you stabbed me as much as i did you and it was only once im the reason youre still alive and yet youre still stabbing me,1,,9,germany,england,11,51,Fall,1906
bad idea,1,,9,germany,england,11,52,Fall,1906
hello we dont have much to talk about here at the start but i just want to tell you to have a good game,1,True,0,germany,turkey,11,0,Spring,1901
thanks i’m not sure i have a preference regarding sweden but we can talk later,1,True,0,turkey,germany,11,1,Spring,1901
you working with the russians if so i can definitely move to hasten austrias demise,0,True,0,germany,turkey,11,2,Fall,1901
any big plans i should know about,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,3,Spring,1902
eh none in particular,1,True,1,germany,turkey,11,4,Spring,1902
ok i’m very curious to see where your fleets are headed,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,5,Spring,1902
whatre you up to anything in particular aside from what should be expected from turkey generally,1,True,1,germany,turkey,11,6,Spring,1902
so i take it you and the russians arent cooperating anymore,1,True,1,germany,turkey,11,7,Fall,1902
are you still interested in going after austria  or is france your next target after england,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,8,Fall,1902
honestly im mostly interested in surviving right now things have gotten intensely strange,1,True,1,germany,turkey,11,9,Fall,1902
how so  youve got a dmz with france two on warsaw and no bad options in the north,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,10,Fall,1902
brits and russians start working together they can pry through my weak spot in the north wouldnt be good,1,True,1,germany,turkey,11,11,Fall,1902
i wouldnt call that situation intensely strange i would call it a normal response to an  aggressive fg,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,12,Fall,1902
still leaves a lot of unanswered questions on what happens next,1,,1,germany,turkey,11,13,Fall,1902
youre probably going to self bounce in denmark,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,14,Fall,1902
and take warsaw,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,15,Fall,1902
so now russia gains sweden is way out of position and probably has to pull one as long if austria and i can get on the same page,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,16,Fall,1902
yeah still thinking if anything could be better than that though the fact that they didnt bounce me in sweden in the first place this last turn is a pain,1,True,1,germany,turkey,11,17,Fall,1902
well theres worse things than getting into a supply center,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,18,Fall,1902
yeah like not being able to hold it till fall and having put yourself somewhat out of position in having done so,1,,1,germany,turkey,11,19,Fall,1902
lets say he did get into sweden with the fleet  now denmark is at risk,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,20,Fall,1902
at least now you know you cant lose a supply center if you guess wrong or dont support yourself,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,21,Fall,1902
such a pessimist you are  🙂,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,22,Fall,1902
best to keep somewhat of a dower outlook on things means that you likely wont get cocky and overestimate your ability to act on people,1,True,1,germany,turkey,11,23,Fall,1902
so how are you and austria getting along,1,True,0,germany,turkey,11,24,Spring,1903
he says hes going after you next but who knows  hes got multiple armies lined up on our border and i cant really defend myself at this point,1,True,0,turkey,germany,11,25,Spring,1903
i dont know why they decided not to go after you honestly its a huge mistake on their part considering theyll be your next best target and youre gaining more than them out of this deal besides which with italys help they could easily have taken both you and russia want to split them down the middle with me,1,True,0,germany,turkey,11,26,Spring,1903
sounds ideal  i assume this means that youre taking warsaw,1,True,0,turkey,germany,11,27,Spring,1903
and what does down the middle mean  are we talking east west or north south,1,True,0,turkey,germany,11,28,Spring,1903
north south probably,1,True,0,germany,turkey,11,29,Spring,1903
im fine with that,1,True,0,turkey,germany,11,30,Spring,1903
do you have anything you’d like to coordinate,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,31,Spring,1904
i’m a little hesitant to go after austria right now but i could be swayed by your actions,0,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,32,Spring,1904
i mean to take st petersburg this season without antagonizing the austrians but after that its pretty free game theyre concerned about your army build,1,True,1,germany,turkey,11,33,Spring,1904
some people see threats everywhere,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,34,Spring,1904
what are your thoughts about moscow i’d like to take a unit off of austria,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,35,Fall,1904
was going to take st petersburg first but if you support warsaw into moscow i wouldnt say no,1,False,1,germany,turkey,11,36,Fall,1904
well he’d just retreat to stp,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,37,Fall,1904
mind supporting me in,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,11,38,Fall,1904
you went after ukraine,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,11,39,Winter,1904
you didnt respond i didnt change my orders accordingly in any case it did no damage,1,False,3,germany,turkey,11,40,Spring,1905
fair enough,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,11,41,Spring,1905
big plans for this year,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,11,42,Spring,1905
anything we can do together,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,11,43,Spring,1905
if you’re n attacking moscow or anything i’d appreciate you to support me to hold in ukraine,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,11,44,Spring,1905
ive got no big plans but i could certainly help you hold couldnt you use sevastopol though,1,True,3,germany,turkey,11,45,Spring,1905
sev is supporting something else i got to get some dots,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,11,46,Spring,1905
fair enough gotta get those dots,1,False,3,germany,turkey,11,47,Spring,1905
odd moves,1,False,3,germany,turkey,11,48,Spring,1905
say the austrians wouldnt have happened to be talking about me have they,1,,6,germany,turkey,11,49,Spring,1906
good afternoon i think its important that you and i come to terms over a few things right here at the start including the fate of belgium and how despite our situation as naturally suited antagonists britain is the larger threat to both of us,1,True,0,germany,france,11,0,Spring,1901
hey germany natural suited antagonists i beg to differ i personally think that over here in the west a francegermany alliance is the strongest preferably taking out england asap what do you think,1,True,0,france,germany,11,1,Spring,1901
i spoke to england and they dont seem like a particularly diplomatic player but im pretty sure i can get into the english channel from there i would like to move to belgium since they will most likely be moving back to london in return for belgium i would be willing to support or convoy you into english territory,0,True,0,france,germany,11,2,Spring,1901
well england hasnt spoken to me just yet so it sounds like perhaps they wont intend to be friendly with me whatsoever i think that your plan sounds pretty solid ill support you into belgium if need be   i only say natural antagonists because thats how it frequently goes notwithstanding the strength of the alliance i personally find it quite strong and not nearly as asymmetrical as alliances between either of us and the brits,1,True,0,germany,france,11,3,Spring,1901
taking the english down asap is definitely something on my agenda though one less front line to worry about,1,True,0,germany,france,11,4,Spring,1901
great ill move the the english channel what are you thinking for moves,1,True,0,france,germany,11,5,Spring,1901
mostly just pivoting toward the low countries kiel to denmark and probably to the north sea from there,1,True,0,germany,france,11,6,Spring,1901
sounds good,1,True,0,france,germany,11,7,Spring,1901
so youre headed to belgium now from the channel yes,1,True,0,germany,france,11,8,Fall,1901
that would be ideal its a bit of a gamble but england will probably will think im going to lon it would be greatly appreciated if you supported me in but you dont have to i dont know what else ruh would do though,1,True,0,france,germany,11,9,Fall,1901
eh the english say theyre moving to london no need for the support i need to send some troops over east dont trust the russians,1,True,0,germany,france,11,10,Fall,1901
i dont trust the french not to try to play me for a patsy and youre far more communicative anyways might as well tell you stuff thatll give you the upper hand,0,True,0,germany,france,11,11,Fall,1901
english,1,True,0,germany,france,11,12,Fall,1901
fuckin brain getting words mixed up and making me look sus ,1,True,0,germany,france,11,13,Fall,1901
ruhr is moving back to munich to deploy east regardless the russians bouncing the austrians in galicia indicates that theyre going to do a juggernaut and i have to do everything i can to stymie that,1,True,0,germany,france,11,14,Fall,1901
and you really trust england,1,True,0,france,germany,11,15,Fall,1901
they are most likely not telling the truth,1,True,0,france,germany,11,16,Fall,1901
but ok sounds good,1,True,0,france,germany,11,17,Fall,1901
no i dont but i think theyd be idiots to do anything else but if youre really worried i can support you in and keep the pivot to the east for next year,1,,0,germany,france,11,18,Fall,1901
i would try to get into englands territory with your fleet,1,True,0,france,germany,11,19,Fall,1901
no its fine dont support,1,True,0,france,germany,11,20,Fall,1901
i intend to but i cant leave denmark till its secured without putting myself way out of position for anything in the east if the russians get aggressive you sure you dont want the support,1,,0,germany,france,11,21,Fall,1901
no of course i want the support as it cant possibly help me and adds an extra layer of protection i just thought you brought up a fair point about russia and its your choice so im not going to argue with you a ton about what you should do,1,True,0,france,germany,11,22,Fall,1901
to be honest i wouldnt be to worried about russia they didnt even move towards you and after hearing what you said i talked with austria and they said they were going to attack russia so i dont think there is an alliance there i would instead invest in capturing english territory which would give you troops to build in your homeland and defend against russia if they choose to attack you,0,True,0,france,germany,11,23,Fall,1901
fair enough ill focus on the english first then,1,True,0,germany,france,11,24,Fall,1901
ok and will you be supporting me into burgundy up to you,1,True,0,france,germany,11,25,Fall,1901
you mean belgium sure nothing better to do for the time being,1,,0,germany,france,11,26,Fall,1901
yes belgium oops,1,True,0,france,germany,11,27,Fall,1901
well i didnt hit the button to update the orders but it worked out just fine anyways i suppose,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,28,Winter,1901
my bad,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,29,Winter,1901
yes its fine sooo ig the game is in grace period so i was wondering what you builds were looking like i will build a fleet in bre and if you build a fleet in kiel the 4 combined fleets should be more than enough to take out britain and we shouldnt have to build anything else in that regard,1,True,1,france,germany,11,30,Winter,1901
im building a fleet in kiel most of my armies are going to move east to counter the juggernaut thats actively happening over there but ill dedicate one army and both fleets to dropping the english,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,31,Winter,1901
great,1,True,1,france,germany,11,32,Winter,1901
what are you thinking about moves we should coordinate,1,True,1,france,germany,11,33,Spring,1902
moving into helgoland bight probably moving into sweden with britains help while i can still manipulate them into thinking im their friend rather than their foe kill two birds with one stone you know two armies move east,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,34,Spring,1902
alright we have a good chance of making it into the north sea if you support helgoland bight into it with both fleets unfortunately it seems the british called my bluff early and the russians have committed to taking sweden so things arent exactly ideal but were still in a pretty definitively winning position,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,35,Fall,1902
russians really fucked me up by not bouncing me in sweden good move on their part,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,36,Fall,1902
hey germany its a shame russia called your bluff i will support helgoland into nth with both of my fleets we should have a 100 chance of getting in if you attack nwy with sweden and cut support this is the best move for sweden in any scenario as that territory is basically lost and who knows maybe england will move nwy to stp and you will end up getting nwy,1,True,1,france,germany,11,37,Fall,1902
yeah the only worry is that england will move north sea to denmark which would be a damn shame and a pain in my ass,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,38,Fall,1902
and if theyre displaced they could retreat there which would just add insult to injury,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,39,Fall,1902
ah good point i dont have anything for pic to do do you think i should have eng convoy it over to whales or do you think it would be more useful to support you in,1,True,1,france,germany,11,40,Fall,1902
also would you mind telling italy the following hey italy you probably know i have an alliance with france and they have troops right next to you they told me that they were going to support themselves into piedmont im letting you know because im worried about them getting too strong and stabbing me as they already have 6 centers or something like that just in your own words i want them to think im supporting myself into piedmont,1,True,1,france,germany,11,41,Fall,1902
picardy can stay put for now i think that the english will anticipate us doing something other than trying to take the north sea and will move to prevent it if they think were thinking far enough ahead its worth the gamble that theyll only throw one support at it besides in all likelihood even if you tried to move to wales yorkshire would block it since yorkshire isnt doing anything useful where it is now,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,42,Fall,1902
will do cant guarantee theyll believe me though,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,43,Fall,1902
sent it along in my own words,0,True,-1,germany,france,11,44,Fall,1902
thx mate,1,True,1,france,germany,11,45,Fall,1902
what do you think i should do in the med with italy i could either move lyo to wes hoping to bounce them therewhy i had you send that message and have mar attack pie or i could just support myself in and if they do go to wes ill move my fleet in the english channel down to cover spainportugul,1,True,1,france,germany,11,46,Fall,1902
if you convoyed from spain to tuscany itd be all over for them effectively,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,47,Fall,1902
everything worked exactly as planned it seems,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,48,Fall,1902
yep,1,True,1,france,germany,11,49,Fall,1902
only worry now is where the brits will retreat to,1,,-1,germany,france,11,50,Fall,1902
im pretty confident they cant retreat to denmark because it was contested this turn,1,True,1,france,germany,11,51,Fall,1902
they cant but they can retreat to ska,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,52,Fall,1902
so what do you think would be the best move you think englands going to try to dislodge north sea with all their navies or do you think theyll want to cover edinburgh more,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,53,Spring,1903
i really dont know,1,True,1,france,germany,11,54,Spring,1903
i think i will support nth with belgium but convoy pic to whales,1,True,1,france,germany,11,55,Spring,1903
good idea even if we lose north sea thatll get us into the isles then its game over for them,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,56,Spring,1903
thats the idea,1,True,1,france,germany,11,57,Spring,1903
ok its a shame we lost the north sea but it was inevitable at least we got whales england should be gone in a few turns and then i can focus all my energy on italy,1,True,1,france,germany,11,58,Spring,1903
if we continue to trust each other communicate and play well i think we have a twoway victory in the bag,1,True,1,france,germany,11,59,Spring,1903
next turn i can support you into nth again and you will definitely get it since i have the army in whales to cut support,1,True,1,france,germany,11,60,Spring,1903
try to suck up as many of russias supply centers as you can they are very weak and seem to be afk,1,True,1,france,germany,11,61,Spring,1903
yeah hopefully if all goes well ill be building quite a lot austrias betrayal of italy in favor of turkey is really telling so i think ill have my hands full on that front soon enough a two way victory sounds splendid to me,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,62,Spring,1903
how will we split britain,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,63,Spring,1903
um so this turn i think im going to support myself into london but also support you into the nth sea from there you can take edi and i can support you into that,1,True,1,france,germany,11,64,Fall,1903
nah focus on succeeding in london poke north sea with belgium so that it cant support im supporting myself into sweden and moving on norway from there if you want to simplify things we could have you take all of britain and just transfer belgium to me so that we both net 2 from the british since ill have norway though i would understand why you might be uncomfortable with that,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,65,Fall,1903
im really torn over what to do in italy i spoke to austria about going after them together and they are thinking about it i could try convoying mar into tuscany with pie supporting this is basically the same as just moving pie into tuscany with support from my fleet except for that if i convoy mar the support is less likely to be cuti think there is a higher chance they will cut support to my fleet than cut supportmove to piedmont,1,True,1,france,germany,11,66,Fall,1903
the austrians are currently making a whole slew of bad decisions allying with the turks is a suckers bet im not sure what you should do tbh the italians arent talking to me much anymore,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,67,Fall,1903
i suppose we could have me take all of britain and have me give you belgium but i would ask that as soon as you take belgium you move back out its definitely an option but i will have to think about it,1,True,1,france,germany,11,68,Fall,1903
oh of course once i had it id get out of there immediately trust is the key in transfers like this,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,69,Fall,1903
take your time weve got several turns until it needs settling and several days till the next turn,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,70,Fall,1903
i could move piedmont to tyr its a great place to be not sure if i would get in though,1,True,1,france,germany,11,71,Fall,1903
tyr is one of those spots where everyone around gets nervous when youre there,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,72,Fall,1903
yep austria wouldnt like that,1,True,1,france,germany,11,73,Fall,1903
good tactical utility though if you want to strongarm into venice,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,74,Fall,1903
i feel like we could very well end up with a standoff between me and you and turkey and austria im kinda trying to brew unrest over there spreading rumours and such,1,True,1,france,germany,11,75,Fall,1903
i have been desperately attempting to convince the austrians that theyre better off with me but it hasnt  been working,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,76,Fall,1903
why didnt you want me supporting you my move into lon was already garunteed,1,True,1,france,germany,11,77,Fall,1903
whatever,1,True,1,france,germany,11,78,Fall,1903
i was thinking either the british or russians would make a play for sweden wanted the support to ensure the move in any case we should have an easy time moving forward,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,79,Fall,1903
in any case were both making pretty good gains,1,True,-1,germany,france,11,80,Fall,1903
ill be building in munich just so i dont catch you by surprise with that want to be able to move in as fast as possible on the austrians when we go for it,1,True,0,germany,france,11,81,Winter,1903
what do you think the next move should be,1,True,0,germany,france,11,82,Winter,1903
could you support bel to nth,1,True,0,france,germany,11,83,Spring,1904
absolutely my fleet in denmark wouldnt be doing anything otherwise are you moving in with piedmont or tyrolia because if its not tyrolia i can support that to stay put just in case the austrians get antsy,1,True,0,germany,france,11,84,Spring,1904
im having tyrolia support piedmont in i will definitly get it unless for some reason the austrians support italy which would be wierd,1,True,0,france,germany,11,85,Spring,1904
thanks for supporting bel,1,True,0,france,germany,11,86,Spring,1904
feel free to support tyr but dont feel pressure to do so if you have a better move in mind,1,True,0,france,germany,11,87,Spring,1904
im waiting to have st petersburg to make a move on the austrians munich has nothing to do for the moment except to support tyrolia,1,True,0,germany,france,11,88,Spring,1904
everything worked out great,1,True,0,france,germany,11,89,Spring,1904
and it looks like the turks and austrians are at each others throats now,1,True,0,germany,france,11,90,Spring,1904
the brits are trying really hard to get me to throw myself against you i mean reeeeeally hard,1,True,0,germany,france,11,91,Fall,1904
lol all i can say is that i hope you dont since we have this game in the bag,1,True,0,france,germany,11,92,Fall,1904
you could use that tell them you will stab me and tell them my movesbut false so that i can get in more easily,1,True,0,france,germany,11,93,Fall,1904
i can probably jump into edinburgh via the norwegian sea this next year no need for the belgium transfer,1,True,0,germany,france,11,94,Fall,1904
lol italy just messaged me and said that austrias build in trieste cannot be anything but a play for venice and then i am willing to concede it to you if you cooperate elsewhere so i guess they dont understand i already have it they sure are getting desperate,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,95,Winter,1904
think i should play along or just tell them about what concede really means and that you cant concede something if your opponent controls it and you have no chance of getting it back,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,96,Winter,1904
also what do you think i should do for builds a fleet in brest or an army in paris,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,97,Winter,1904
go ahead play along lol should be interesting if i were you id build fleets the enemy from here on out is one on the seas almost exclusively,1,True,1,germany,france,11,98,Winter,1904
k what do you think about builds,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,99,Winter,1904
would you be ok with me building army in paris i would send it over to the south east prob,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,100,Winter,1904
not sure at least one army might build a navy even though i wont have much use for it anymore,1,True,1,germany,france,11,101,Winter,1904
you can if you want but i think a navy would do a lot to forcing the mediterranean open faster italys a huge traffic jam for armies,1,True,1,germany,france,11,102,Winter,1904
do you still want belgium at this point our borders are like super demiliterized which is pretty nice but at this point i do trust you if you want to have it if you want an center it would prob be better for you to have belgium than enland or do you even want a center since you already have 1 more than me,0,True,-1,france,germany,11,103,Spring,1905
well i certainly wouldnt say no youll definitely have an easier time taking the italians than i will bleeding anything from the austrians,1,True,1,germany,france,11,104,Spring,1905
whoa didnt realize we were so close to adjudication what are you thinking for moves,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,105,Spring,1905
i dont need support from you anywhere this turn all my units will be making moves at englands centerstaking the medtaking italy,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,106,Spring,1905
all i can say is that i really hope you dont betray me since you have some units looking like they could just walk into my supply centers we have such a good run going right now as long as you dont betray me we can definitly get a twoway draw,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,107,Spring,1905
i think im gonna move on the austrians take them out while theyre distracted with the turks,1,,1,germany,france,11,108,Spring,1905
england and italy both are truly desperate to get me to turn on you and even the austrians have thrown some urgings in lol,1,,1,germany,france,11,109,Spring,1905
lol yes the austrians hate me for staying in triest when i told them i would move italy has been desperatly begging for dmz and england is obviously done,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,110,Spring,1905
right and austria cant possibly take me and turkey at the same time,1,True,1,germany,france,11,111,Spring,1905
as long as we keep austria and turkey fighting you can run them down by land and i can apply presure with fleets,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,112,Spring,1905
yeah im playing both sides to keep them at each others throats,1,True,1,germany,france,11,113,Spring,1905
great,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,114,Spring,1905
for the record i really hate doing crap like this but i told myself right at the start that i needed to gussy up and go for a solo for once in my life i love this game but ironically hate the deception aspect   in any case its nothing personal and you were super cool to work with,1,True,1,germany,france,11,115,Spring,1905
tbh i was pretty sure you would do that but for once i wanted to trust somebody in this game bc ive been known to backstab people like crazy your all good imma put up a fight though and try to stop you 😉,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,116,Spring,1905
you were cool to work with to,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,117,Spring,1905
good luck we did have the two way draw in the bag though,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,118,Spring,1905
wow you really are pouring units into my hometown basically leaving austria and turkey alone huh,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,119,Spring,1905
i know we did and to be honest ive been super wishy washy about actually going through with this because of that i almost did it last turn i still feel like a jerk doing it,1,True,1,germany,france,11,120,Spring,1905
and yeah as long as theyre at each others throats they arent too much threat unless you pull some silver tongue on them to get a real coalition of the willing going,1,True,1,germany,france,11,121,Spring,1905
silver toung it is its going to be pretty great if i can get them to organize then we can actually win against you and that would be cool well see,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,122,Spring,1905
that would be exceptionally interesting i wouldnt have a lot of chance to shore up that flank itdbe a fair and square win in any case good luck and sorry about this again,1,True,1,germany,france,11,123,Spring,1905
your good i almost definitly would have done the same,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,124,Spring,1905
i normally dont just because i feel like actually being trustworthy most of the time generally improves the game culture or maybe im just soft and making excuses hard to say lol,1,True,1,germany,france,11,125,Spring,1905
🤷‍♂️,1,True,-1,france,germany,11,126,Spring,1905
well this next turn is going to be weird as hell however it turns out,1,True,5,germany,france,11,127,Fall,1906
an outstanding move on your part by the way the italians and british are not being as enthusiastic of revanchists as i was hoping,1,True,5,germany,france,11,128,Fall,1906

well russia told me that he was going to bounce me in the black sea  i figured whats the worst that could happen  you bounce him in rumania  if i support you in you only get one build  so since you said you were cool with me having greece in the long term why not go for it in the short term,1,False,0,turkey,austria,11,20,Winter,1901

the trick will be getting to italy before france does  what would help is if italy would head west towards france  thatll leave his back door open for us  maybe if you told him that you didnt have any interest in helping against turkey and that he should make a go another direction but  then again  after bouncing in trieste twice in a row he might not be super interested in working with you,1,False,0,turkey,austria,11,24,Winter,1901

well i guess my first question is whether or not you still trust me you can ask italy or germany i thought i saw a juggernaut forming and that would have been the end of my game i had to play it safe especially since you switched moves on me last fall,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,37,Fall,1902
i understand how you could say the same about me but i’m in the more vulnerable position,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,38,Fall,1902
it’s possible that you could take rum this turn if russia doesn’t defend it they seem like a bit of a wild card so who knows what they will decide to do you could go for that on your own and when you see that i don’t attack you this season you might be able to trust me enough to move this forward,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,39,Fall,1902
i think  i think you have budapest vulnerable i’d appreciate it if ukr either went for moscow or sevastopol   we have to worry about the western triple,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,40,Fall,1902
so let’s get our armies into russia and counter germany there,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,41,Fall,1902
do you think you can get me into sev,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,42,Fall,1902
like can you commit bla to supporting me in,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,43,Fall,1902
well that fleet is busy attacking rumania  i would like a build which i think is fair,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,44,Fall,1902
what is serbia doing  maybe serbia can support me into rumania,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,45,Fall,1902
i think i need to protect my homeland with ser,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,46,Fall,1902
but  me trusting you after you lied to me  thats a tall order  im not closed off to it but id like to know if you know what the italian is planning on doing,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,47,Fall,1902
i understand that you would want a build but then there is no reason for me to attack sev,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,48,Fall,1902
well sev could be supporting gal back to rumania,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,49,Fall,1902
well to be completely honest we were gonna attack you because i was convinced that you were allied with russia so i have some stuff to figure out,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,50,Fall,1902
i think our first order is deciding what we think russia is gonna do,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,51,Fall,1902
i know that it doesnt benefit you any and i think your better move it to go for moscow,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,52,Fall,1902
i might be able to convince italy to back up since they have the french to deal with,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,53,Fall,1902
i would appreciate that,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,54,Fall,1902
game moves tonight at midnight right,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,55,Fall,1902
i think that russia is probably on the weaker end of the spectrum  i think that he goes defensive,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,56,Fall,1902
he might lash out at vienna but it is extremely unlikely that he goes for budapest while you move to vienna,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,57,Fall,1902
i think honestly that he supports himself back into rumania and covers moscow,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,58,Fall,1902
which is why i was requesting that you go for sevastopol cutting its support,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,59,Fall,1902
that would be the smart move he seems irrational though he doesn’t really negotiate and is very aggressive,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,60,Fall,1902
yes i dont disagree  im a little disappointed that you thought i was going to blindly ally with him,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,61,Fall,1902
what do you think italy is going to do with a greece,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,62,Fall,1902
was he supposed to support you into bulgaria,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,63,Fall,1902
he just offered but i’m explaining to him that you attacked russia last turn he didn’t realize,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,64,Fall,1902
ive asked him to allow us to go after russia while he gets into a better position against france  we need to drive a wedge into this western triple,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,65,Fall,1902
ok i now realize that theres no western triple  instead its an fg  which is just as bad for you guys since germany is already into russia  heres my idea and take it or leave it  but i suggest that he keep rotating his fleets out maybe move towards wes and tun while you backfill ion  he builds a fleet in rom and you convoy him into nap in the spring  now hes got three fleets in play while france is trying to land a unit on england  meanwhile you move your army out of ser and towards munich and i move bulrum north into sev mos and war  its a logical expansion for all of us and presents each of us with room to grow and peace in the balkans,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,66,Fall,1902
i’m gonna have to think about it because so far germany has been a good friend for me this game,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,67,Fall,1902
right  and where is he going to go next,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,68,Fall,1902
and when you say good friend  what supply centers did he help you into  🙂,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,69,Fall,1902
totally understandable just has been giving good information and stuff right now his plan is to eat france after england could be a lie but i would believe it,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,70,Fall,1902
right  with what units,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,71,Fall,1902
france has three armies  if he gets into england hell get more builds  unless youre going to help him get past france in the south hell have armies in france for defense  and if youre antiitaly  then we should be having a totally different conversation,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,72,Fall,1902
im not saying that you should sign up 100 for the go after germany party  but ive presented you with a fair proposal and it doesnt require you to do anything thats against your interests  and if it can clear up your border in the south it can let you access where the dots are which for you  is germany,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,73,Fall,1902
i gotcha i’ve gotta eat dinner right now but how late tonight will you be able to chat,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,74,Fall,1902
ill be around  either on the computer or on my phone,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,75,Fall,1902
okay i’m reading your proposal again and are you saying you would get all of russia,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,76,Fall,1902
i now realize what i wrote but i do need an outlet  if you want to see me nothing but bottled up and without an outlet for expansion  we need to have another kind of conversation,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,77,Fall,1902
not without exchanging some of those centers for rumania andor bulgaria,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,78,Fall,1902
im also totally down with attacking through italy and pouring fleets into the med  but i am under the impression that you want to ally with him and want to find some way to work together with you,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,79,Fall,1902
i do not want you bottled up bottled up turkey usually attacks austria,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,80,Fall,1902
i agree with that sentiment,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,81,Fall,1902
what would your thoughts be if i could get germany to support ukr into war,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,82,Fall,1902
i think that would be awesome,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,83,Fall,1902
it would be difficult to defend but is the right move for you  worry about holding it later get the bulwark against his growth now,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,84,Fall,1902
okay we’ll go ahead with that then,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,85,Fall,1902
what will happen with serbia and greece,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,86,Fall,1902
not sure what would you vote for,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,87,Fall,1902
well id prefer it if you didnt cut bulgarias support of an attack on rumania,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,88,Fall,1902
of course not i was probably just gonna support gre holding,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,89,Fall,1902
if you trust italy not to go after serbia then you could rotate your armies out and probably bounce in oneboth of them,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,90,Fall,1902
yeah still figuring that it,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,91,Fall,1902
out,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,92,Fall,1902
is he sending his fleet to ems or towards france,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,93,Fall,1902
well you know which direction id prefer,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,94,Fall,1902
i’m hoping toward france i told him he should,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,95,Fall,1902
ive enjoyed speaking with you by the way,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,96,Fall,1902
i hope that we can continue to have these kinds of dialogues,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,97,Fall,1902
yeah you as well it’s good to find people that are actually able to negotiate and stuff i hope we can get past our early struggles,0,True,0,austria,turkey,11,98,Fall,1902
do you play any facetoface,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,99,Fall,1902
not much hard to get 7 people together,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,100,Fall,1902
where abouts do you live general area im not trying to cyberstalk you,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,101,Fall,1902
i go to michigan state,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,102,Fall,1902
theres a sizeable hobby in chicago,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,103,Fall,1902
but i dont think east lansing is that close,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,104,Fall,1902
haha no it is not,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,105,Fall,1902
i went to college in cleveland and could never get a game together  i did travel to tournaments though  theyre a lot of fun as long as you can get over yourself and realize that every game is an opportunity to improve,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,106,Fall,1902
how do tournaments work,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,107,Fall,1902
three to four more or less random board draws  usually you score your best three results  there are a few different scoring systems but generally speaking  if you get good results youll do well,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,108,Fall,1902
seems fun how do the negotiations go like do you pull people aside,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,109,Fall,1902
yes usually its in a big room  like a hotel ballroom or dormitory basement,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,110,Fall,1902
and theres 35 boards going on simultaneously,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,111,Fall,1902
so theres about 1030 conversations going simultaneously,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,112,Fall,1902
okay so people know who you’re talking to that is one thing i like about this is like i could be talking to russia and you wouldn’t know it,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,113,Fall,1902
obviously i’m not in this case,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,114,Fall,1902
or maybe you are ,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,115,Fall,1902
hahahaha,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,116,Fall,1902
by the way if serbia isnt moving can it support conrum,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,117,Fall,1902
it’s moving,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,118,Fall,1902
may i ask where,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,119,Fall,1902
bud,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,120,Fall,1902
ill trust you on this one,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,121,Fall,1902
italy has gotten himself way out of position i know you like him but  he’s not taking advantage of his opportunity against france and is wide open to attack by us you could go to greece and i could go to rumania and we’d have peace i’d have to hold for a turn so that he doesn’t retreat to bulgaria,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,122,Fall,1902
yeah let’s look at the builds first,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,123,Fall,1902
i’m also a little frustrated with him because he hasn’t replied to a single one of my messages in days not that i’m overloading him but this needs to be a two way conversation  i mean that’s what we’re being compensated for,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,124,Winter,1902
yeah he hasn’t chatted a ton with me either,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,125,Winter,1902
🤷‍♂️,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,126,Winter,1902
you around  im weighing my build options,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,127,Winter,1902
any thoughts  fleet versus army,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,128,Winter,1902
alright we doing this,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,129,Spring,1903
my bad didn’t see the notifications,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,130,Spring,1903
so obviously you’re gonna kick italy out of your area are you gonna take sev this turn,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,131,Spring,1903
well i’d like to coordinate my move with you are you taking greece he’d be down to one army and since he doesn’t seem interested in defending his dots from france you and i might as well go after them,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,132,Spring,1903
honestly i have to decide how much i trust you vs how much faith i have in him because at this point in the game i still need an ally,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,133,Spring,1903
i’d like for you to take sev it we need russia to lose more units so that we can finish him before germany is too strong,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,134,Spring,1903
i feel like despite our rocky start you and i have communicated enough that we can declare a full alliance though,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,135,Spring,1903
regarding sev i’d like to take it this year maybe in the fall,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,136,Spring,1903
i think we can definitely partner up and work together to both our benefit i also don’t think it will be particularly difficult to separate our forces i only have two armies so i’m not much of a threat to you and you only have one fleet  so i’m not worried about you coming after me by yourself the wild card in all of this is italy and he’s only got one fleet over by me and a french unit in piedmont,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,137,Spring,1903
right now i have bulgaria supporting serbia into greece i’ll rotate up the coast towards sevastopol in the fall and we’ll convoy you onto the boot as soon as possible i mean  that’s a strong position for you,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,138,Spring,1903
if we were to follow this sort of path where do you see your expansion going you can get sev tun and nap then what,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,139,Spring,1903
also i don’t need your support into gre i would rather you took sev this turn,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,140,Spring,1903
expansion maybe mos and stp i’m assuming you’re going to head west towards germany in this scenario otherwise this is only a 10 year game i don’t have grand designs on a solo victory or anything,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,141,Spring,1903
ok i will hold in bulgaria so that italy can’t retreat there and i’ll take out sev you’re not dislodging galicia are you i’m worried about him retreating to rumania,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,142,Spring,1903
sounds good i am not dislodging,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,143,Spring,1903
ok,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,144,Spring,1903
i know youre choosing between working with italy and working with me  the path im offering to you allows you to control your own growth and depend on yourself for gains  and making it so that our border is unitless  the path of working with italy also allows you to grow but youll be depending on someone else for help after the initial gain and youll have to dedicate units to the balkans until im fully eliminated from the game   both are legitimate choices but i think my offer is superior based on merit  ive demonstrated that im a reliable partner that i make solid moves and do what i say,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,145,Spring,1903
yeah i gotcha i just hate playing as austria and don’t have a lot of successful experience often due to turkey that and the beginning of this game has made me cautious,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,146,Spring,1903
but italy’s attack on you is uncoordinated with me and not really going anywhere and it’s hard to work with that,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,147,Spring,1903
i’m curious what your plan is you have a lot of armies on my border,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,148,Spring,1903
yeah i gotta move those i’m sorry i was just playing cautious hopefully russia has actually quit that would make things much easier i will definitely have to go cover tri because italy is in ven and pissed at me,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,149,Spring,1903
i’m moving emsion can you support it in with greece,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,150,Fall,1903
eas,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,151,Fall,1903
yes,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,152,Fall,1903
will you support me into años,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,153,Fall,1903
mos,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,154,Fall,1903
i was gonna self bounce in rumania,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,155,Fall,1903
is germany kicking you out of warsaw,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,156,Fall,1903
no but we’re trying to transfer it it was a condition of me getting it first,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,157,Fall,1903
i can’t this year he’s got that pesky a galicia,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,158,Fall,1903
okay it’s all good,0,True,0,austria,turkey,11,159,Fall,1903
hey i wanted to say  is it something you need to prevent the loss of a center because if germany is going to start trying to take dots off of you you need help into moscow more than i need to guarantee i don’t lose rumania in fact i can just cover rum with bulgaria you’re not going to stab me for one dot i certainly hope,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,160,Fall,1903
i am not yeah i was gonna make that argument but wait until we got closer to when moves were due,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,161,Fall,1903
and yes that would help guarantee that i don’t lose one,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,162,Fall,1903
so how’s that sounding,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,163,Fall,1903
ok  im down for working together for mutual benefit  id appreciate it if you began moving your units away from my dots,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,164,Fall,1903
was planning on it,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,165,Fall,1903
glad i trusted you i think we’re past the awkward phase of our relationship,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,166,Fall,1903
i hope so now i need to make sure france is just doing what they did to get into ven,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,167,Fall,1903
or end around on germany,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,168,Winter,1903
that would be a premature stab,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,169,Winter,1903
might be his last real chance,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,170,Winter,1903
how do you want to proceed  can you support ion to hold  id like to convoy my army into apulia  we can gut italy like a trout if thats what youd like to do  otherwise we could look at getting you back into warsaw  is germany where you want to head next,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,171,Spring,1904
i kinda have to take care of italy first so that front is secured,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,172,Spring,1904
ok are you ok with the convoy to apulia,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,173,Spring,1904
yeah of course,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,174,Spring,1904
or do you want italy all for yourself 😊,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,175,Spring,1904
no we could use the help,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,176,Spring,1904
are you cool with me displacing the last russian troop so that we don’t have to deal with it,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,177,Spring,1904
also have you reached out to france about your move,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,178,Spring,1904
let me look at the map,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,179,Spring,1904
and i’m not sure it’s a good idea to tell france what my plans are regarding italy i don’t think he’s interested in sharing the prize,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,180,Spring,1904
i mean sure which unit is going in i can support it,0,True,0,turkey,austria,11,181,Spring,1904
and you can focus on grabbing stp or getting position on warsaw or munich,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,182,Spring,1904
gal is going in,0,True,0,austria,turkey,11,183,Spring,1904
and france asked me to coordinate so it’s possible that he would want to with you,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,184,Spring,1904
are you coordinating with him i’d just dislodge tyrolia  if he retreats into munich that’s a win for you if he takes venice we’ll get you in there in the fall,0,True,0,turkey,austria,11,185,Spring,1904
not really coordinating no,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,186,Spring,1904
ok cool  i dont really need to know and ill find out in two hours but im wondering if youll have two units on venice in the fall  giving us three,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,187,Spring,1904
i’m still not sure,0,False,0,austria,turkey,11,188,Spring,1904
ughhh this is going to be a slog i guess we’ll be trading centers while germany and france get bigger 🤷‍♂️,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,189,Spring,1904
well this will be fun,1,False,0,austria,turkey,11,190,Fall,1904
unnecessary though,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,191,Fall,1904
your call,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,192,Fall,1904
because it’s highly unlikely france will get to me before germany comes for you,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,193,Fall,1904
when you wish washed on venice and suggested collaboration with france i changed all my orders,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,194,Fall,1904
i only did it because i didn’t trust you i would have trusted you if you had built that army in smy,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,195,Fall,1904
ok you never once said anything to me bout it,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,196,Fall,1904
didn’t want you to be on to me knowing,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,197,Fall,1904
im sad because it feels like i lost a friend  i really enjoyed talking and strategizing with you,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,198,Winter,1904
we really couldn’t trust each other we both stabbed on the same turn twice,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,199,Winter,1904
what other stab  are you referring to fall 01  because i think its impossible to stab someone in 01,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,200,Spring,1905
probably what i’m talking about it how is it impossible we both went back on an agreement,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,201,Spring,1905
1901 is the feeling out year,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,202,Spring,1905
i’d have to look back and see what year i’m thinking of but does it really matter,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,203,Spring,1905
ok so heres the thing  one of two things is going to happen germany is going to come after you unlikely or germany is going to pour into france much more likely,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,204,Spring,1905
but with either scenario im not sure how productive a land war with me is going to be for your long term survival,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,205,Spring,1905
agreed i honestly don’t think i can win this game,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,206,Spring,1905
well neither of us is going to solo in 6 years,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,207,Spring,1905
germany  could,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,208,Spring,1905
all he needs is moscow and one of your centersmarseilles  because he has fleet superiority in the north and italy just took a unit off the board,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,209,Spring,1905
not probable but possible  but it makes sense hes giving me the hard sell to attack you and offering all sorts of long term assistance,0,True,0,turkey,austria,11,210,Spring,1905
yeah i think he’s gonna solo unless france attacks him,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,211,Spring,1905
france cant attack him,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,212,Spring,1905
what is france going to attack him with,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,213,Spring,1905
i’m not saying like this season,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,214,Spring,1905
i mean literally what is he going to attack him with,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,215,Spring,1905
his fleets,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,216,Spring,1905
wow yeah he does have way too many fleets,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,217,Spring,1905
look were not so stuck fighting each other  i think we both can admit that neither of us is going to win this game  but id really prefer not to lose the game to  a solo,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,218,Spring,1905
so what do you propose,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,219,Spring,1905
that we get you into warsaw,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,220,Spring,1905
im being 100 serious  my orders right now are for a full scale attack on you  but im willing to change them to be cooperative if i feel like youre being honest with me and are actually open to working together  i also dont need to get a dot right now and am willing for you to gain  if its off of germany,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,221,Spring,1905
i will change sev to supporting mos to hold  ukr will support rumgal and i suggest you try to get into boh so that you can cut sils support of war to hold,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,222,Spring,1905
i could be wrong and germany could not go after france and instead go after you full bore  if he does these are exactly the orders you need to use anyway  but this prevents the solo by germany  which he could get if you and i fight  it would be close but france is totally incompetent and does not have the units to mount an actual defense  if france had build an army in paris this would be a totally different conversation  but he built a fleet in brest,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,223,Spring,1905
you could also take advantage of the situation to reposition your fleet to threaten venice and take advantage of the frenchgerman situation but thats your call  id appreciate it if you didnt try to take advantage of this situation and come at me full bore but  even if you did come at me strong im not sure you gain much,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,224,Spring,1905
and you would risk a lot by exposing your back to germany  because if you do come after me you can be damn sure im helping him into moscow and anywhere else i can,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,225,Spring,1905
yeah i’ll try and come up with the best moves for me i would be willing to try and work with you because even if you’re lying to me i was gonna lose anyways,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,226,Spring,1905
i’m hoping you realize that as well,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,227,Spring,1905
we have time before the next orders are due,1,,0,austria,turkey,11,228,Spring,1905
germany is asking for support into moscow,0,True,0,turkey,austria,11,229,Spring,1905
so he might be setting up for a move into galicia he’s not really being open about his moves,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,230,Spring,1905
interesting,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,231,Spring,1905
so  what do you want to do,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,232,Spring,1905
good morning,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,233,Spring,1905
okay i’m sorry i haven’t been around you able to talk,1,False,0,austria,turkey,11,234,Spring,1905
what lies were you going to waste my time with on a sunday evening,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,235,Spring,1905
none you told me that you currently had an all out attack planned on me until we talked and then we were never able to talk,1,True,0,austria,turkey,11,236,Spring,1905
i admit that it was kind of my fault we never talked but i couldn’t have faith that you changed your orders since we hadn’t talked,1,False,0,austria,turkey,11,237,Spring,1905
go after warsaw i’ll build fleets and dmz our borders harass me and i’ll be a headache for you,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,238,Fall,1905
 i’m disappointed in you not in your moves but that you’ve being compensated to communicate with other players and you’re apparently comfortable taking money for something and not doing it that speaks volumes about you ,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,239,Fall,1905
i literally told you my orders you chose to ignore them,1,True,0,turkey,austria,11,240,Fall,1905
that seems a bit dramatic,1,True,2,austria,turkey,11,241,Spring,1906
🤷‍♂️ i’m interested to see if germany can solo here it’ll be close,1,True,-2,turkey,austria,11,242,Spring,1906
i mean i still would acknowledge that we should not fight if we want any chance at winning,1,,2,austria,turkey,11,243,Spring,1906
but are we ever gonna trust each other,1,,2,austria,turkey,11,244,Spring,1906
you never stopped lying to me show me the good faith moves you never actually made and i’ll leave you to fight off germany but i know that you’re just bullshitting me in order to marginally improve your position against me,1,True,-2,turkey,austria,11,245,Spring,1906
i know man i’m honestly sorry,1,True,2,austria,turkey,11,246,Fall,1906
i hate austria and am terrible at playing it i can’t ever trust anyone and freak out every time i play as them i’ve been a dick this game because of it,1,True,2,austria,turkey,11,247,Fall,1906
i see  i see that you cant help yourself  go after germany stop coming after me,1,True,-2,turkey,austria,11,248,Fall,1906
i don’t know what that means,1,True,2,austria,turkey,11,249,Fall,1906
enjoy your disband you should have taken the free dots in warsaw and moscow,1,True,-2,turkey,austria,11,250,Fall,1906
would you mind keeping germany from getting a solo,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,11,251,Winter,1907
planning on it,1,True,1,austria,turkey,11,252,Spring,1908
good luck can’t see how he’d stop you  i’m going to continue a defensive play your commitment to the antiturkey strategy is impressive,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,11,253,Spring,1908
you’re so full of it,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,11,254,Spring,1908
you have plenty of easy centers and you still relentlessly attack me,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,11,255,Spring,1908
if you’re going to throw the solo be definitive about it support him into your own centers and be done with it or have a “if you don’t do x i’ll do y” where why is throw the solo,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,11,256,Spring,1908
but be rational i’m not going to just give you my dots,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,11,257,Spring,1908
i truthfully don’t think that he is going to solo,1,True,1,austria,turkey,11,258,Fall,1908
i will stop attacking you if you move on warsaw and vienna,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,11,259,Fall,1908
moscow is his 18th,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,11,260,Fall,1908
fuck it yeah i’ll attack him believe me if you want i know you have issues with it and i don’t blame you,1,True,1,austria,turkey,11,261,Fall,1908
i’ve felt for a while that your best possible result was peace with italy and me to stop germany  so i want to believe you i won’t attack you any more,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,11,262,Fall,1908
i’m supporting myself to hold i ask that you play defense,1,True,3,turkey,austria,11,263,Spring,1909

you can take sev,1,True,-3,austria,turkey,11,265,Fall,1909
i think i have to can you support me into ukr and support italy into tyrol,1,True,3,turkey,austria,11,266,Fall,1909
i can’t support you but i can support him,1,True,-3,austria,turkey,11,267,Fall,1909
why cant you support me  what else would a warsaw be doing,1,True,3,turkey,austria,11,268,Fall,1909
nicely done  nicely nicely done,1,True,3,turkey,austria,11,269,Fall,1909
the key to not losing to the solo is  assuming the loss of portugal which is two coin flips  not losing 2 of the 3 russian centers  youre going to lose stp  the question then becomes how to we preserve warsaw  my recommendation is  a vie s tyr  boh a war  ukr a stp  mos a bud  gal i tyr  boh i tri  tyr i ven  pie i tus s ven  pie t sev  ukr t rum s war  ukr t ank  sev convoy  this plan destroys ukr or ensures that we control it  it places units in places that they can cut supports on warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or maintaining it if we dont  chances are if stp is dislodged it will be able to retreat to lvn    worst case is that germany just rotates his armies north  supporting himself into lvn and getting three on warsaw lvn pru and sil  but well either be in moscow or galicia probably both and ukraine  well also have two on munich and he can either keep munich or go after warsaw  the other option is to support ourselves into galicia and ukraine  im willing to do as you suggest,1,True,2,turkey,austria,11,270,Winter,1909
i like your first plan with the moves all laid out,1,True,-2,austria,turkey,11,271,Spring,1910
