germany  just the person i want to speak with i have a somewhat crazy idea that i‚Äôve always wanted to try with ig but i‚Äôve never actually convinced the other guy to try it and what‚Äôs worse it might make you suspicious of me   sodo i suggest it  i‚Äôm thinking that this is a low stakes game not a tournament or anything and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun that‚Äôs my hope anyway  what is your appetite like for unusual and crazy,1,True,0,italy,germany,1,0,Spring,1901
youve whet my appetite italy whats the suggestion,1,True,0,germany,italy,1,1,Spring,1901
üëç,1,True,0,italy,germany,1,2,Spring,1901
it seems like there are a lot of ways that could go wrongi dont see why france would see you approachingtaking munichwhile i do nothing about itand not immediately feel skittish,1,True,0,germany,italy,1,3,Spring,1901
yeah i can‚Äôt say i‚Äôve tried it and it works cause i‚Äôve never tried it or seen it but how i think it would work is a my spring move looks like an attack on austria so it would not be surprising if you did not cover munich then b you build two armies which looks like we‚Äôre really at war and you‚Äôre going to eject me then we launch the attack in spring so there is really no part of this that would raise alarm bells with france  all that said i‚Äôve literally never done it before and it does involve risk for you so i‚Äôm not offended or concerned if it‚Äôs just not for you i‚Äôm happy to play more conventionally too up to you,1,,0,italy,germany,1,4,Spring,1901
i am just sensing that you don‚Äôt like this idea so shall we talk about something else that was just a crazy idea i‚Äôve always wanted to try i‚Äôm happy to play more conservatively,1,,0,italy,germany,1,5,Spring,1901
any thoughts,1,,0,italy,germany,1,6,Spring,1901
sorry italy ive been away doing um german things brewing lagers,1,True,0,germany,italy,1,7,Spring,1901
i dont think im ready to go for that idea however id be down for some good olfashioned austriakicking,1,False,0,germany,italy,1,8,Spring,1901
i am pretty conflicted about whether to guess that you were telling the truth or lying about the ‚Äúbrewing lagers‚Äù thing i am going to take it literally and say üëé even though i don‚Äôt think you meant it deceptively üòâ,1,True,0,italy,germany,1,9,Spring,1901
but i think i can get over ‚Äúlagergate‚Äù and we can still be friends   as of right now i think austria may be my most reliable ally i‚Äôm thinking i‚Äôd like to play as a central trio if you have any interest in that thoughts,1,True,0,italy,germany,1,10,Spring,1901
we havent even passed a season yet and you have a most reliable ally  ill consider this proposal but basically im not going to expose myself to risk from either of you until ive seen a bit of your behavior,1,True,0,germany,italy,1,11,Spring,1901
well at least i have an idea of who to trust obviously my ideas are subject to change   i understand your desire to watch behavior before committing to anything i personally am a partner player i look carefully early in the game for a small group to work with and then i value loyalty and collaboration i like to work closely with a tightknit alliance   if you prefer to hop and back and forth or play more of an individual game then we might not be a good match   i‚Äôm looking for a loyal ally or two that i can coordinate with and make awesome moves with makes the game easier and a lot more fun,1,True,0,italy,germany,1,12,Spring,1901
just an fyi i‚Äôve now had both england and france suggest to me that i should move to tyrolia and france will support me to munich in the fall one saying that to me is not a big deal but with both mentioning it my alarm bells are going off i am concerned about an ef   i‚Äôm certainly not moving to tyrolia but i just want you to be cautious here i feel like england and france are working together,1,True,0,italy,germany,1,13,Spring,1901
i appreciate the tip but im wondering why youre so against ousting me from munich if i havent explicitly agreed to be your ally,1,True,0,germany,italy,1,14,Fall,1901
because it is terrible terrible play for italy to attack germany in my view if i were to attack you in munich i could never hold munich so all i would be doing is weakening you and helping france england or both to get really big   i don‚Äôt have any longterm path going north helping france to take you down is a sucker‚Äôs play whether you are working with me or not,1,,0,italy,germany,1,15,Fall,1901
did france tell you he was moving to burgundy or was that a stab,1,True,0,italy,germany,1,16,Fall,1901
i was not informed of it no and england is leading me to believe its part of a play for belgium so if theyre working together this might be a trick  italy you seem like a straight shooter and austria has confirmed with me about your twos alliance so ill confide in youthis is my first ever game of diplomacy and i think that teaming up with the two of you could help me learn more and have more fun so if youre still interested in a central powers alliance im in,1,True,0,germany,italy,1,17,Fall,1901
okay full disclosure im not very smart and i accidentally let slip to england that you told me france was plotting to take munich im sorry for the error but i figured it was better to admit it so you know that englandfrance may not trust you,1,True,0,germany,italy,1,18,Fall,1901
okay thanks for telling me,1,True,0,italy,germany,1,19,Fall,1901
so um no alliance then,1,True,1,germany,italy,1,20,Winter,1901
i do want to be allies sorry busy weekend here running around with bambinos more to come,1,True,-1,italy,germany,1,21,Winter,1901
what would you think of helping me take marseilles in two turns,1,True,1,germany,italy,1,22,Winter,1901
hi germany i‚Äôll certainly consider that though i‚Äôll note traditionally germany would help italy to marseilles if the two of them work together there the reason is that if i help you to marseilles i‚Äôm basically cut off from going west and getting anything myself so usually germany would help italy into marseilles to encourage italy to come west and germany would plan to take paris belgium and brest,1,True,-1,italy,germany,1,23,Winter,1901
fair enoughill help you take it then but ill need to deal with belgium first,1,True,1,germany,italy,1,24,Winter,1901
how are things going with england i think that getting him to work with you is the main key here,1,True,-1,italy,germany,1,25,Winter,1901
im tryingi just offered to assist with taking sweden in exchange for some assistance into belgiumnot sure if theyll go for it,1,True,1,germany,italy,1,26,Spring,1902
i‚Äôll check with england and try to see where his head is at,1,True,-1,italy,germany,1,27,Spring,1902
ive actually been thinking about this game all day üòÖ  and have come up with a plan i like a bit better but england still hasnt responded to my initial offer,1,,1,germany,italy,1,28,Spring,1902
that‚Äôs the worst  and i‚Äôm glad to see you‚Äôre so focused on this in your first game it‚Äôs a really great game if you put in the time and effort,1,True,-1,italy,germany,1,29,Spring,1902
youre definitely telling the truth on that one so can i count on you to move to piedmont this season,1,True,1,germany,italy,1,30,Spring,1902
i don‚Äôt think i can afford to move to piedmont this season i don‚Äôt really trust austria to avoid walking through that door if i leave it wide open   i think you need to get england on board to attack france,1,True,-1,italy,germany,1,31,Spring,1902
thats valid and actually i was conferring with england and we concluded that its not really gonna be possible for me to help you take marseilles this year anyway   what are you and austria planning for this year then im willing to tell you my plans in exchange as a gesture of trust   have you communicated at all with england or france,1,True,1,germany,italy,1,32,Spring,1902
hi are you there  just woke up   england did return my message but he did not tell me anything substantive so i really don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing i‚Äôm planning to move towards turkey,1,True,-1,italy,germany,1,33,Spring,1902
well you‚Äôre in trouble that england move is trouble   i‚Äôm going to try to convince him to change course i suggest you be very kind to him and don‚Äôt burn that bridge i think your game hinges on turning england around,1,True,-1,italy,germany,1,34,Spring,1902
hi germany  i‚Äôm working hard on turning england and i‚Äôm also trying to get russia to come to your aid doing the best i can i‚Äôll keep you posted,1,True,-1,italy,germany,1,35,Fall,1902
england just told me that russia is helping them to take denmark so that may be a lost cause granted the source for that intel is a serpentine jackalspawn,1,True,1,germany,italy,1,36,Fall,1902
okay i‚Äôm reasonably sure that england wants to take the channel and attack france now   i believe that you should basically do whatever england asks to help make this happen as long as e attacks f you will be in a much better position and you‚Äôll gain back centers quickly   what are you hearing,1,True,1,italy,germany,1,37,Spring,1903
what are your plans for this turn i cant help but notice that munich is surrounded by foreign armies on three sides  i wish i could be more helpful but im pretty much just treading water right now trying not to lose anything else,1,True,-1,germany,italy,1,38,Fall,1903
hey ‚Äî sorry just getting back into this now,1,True,1,italy,germany,1,39,Fall,1903
i have good news 1 i am finally attacking france this turn 2 i will be supporting munich to hold from tyrolia   let‚Äôs turn this game around yes,1,True,1,italy,germany,1,40,Fall,1903
i am pretty sure that england is not attacking you this turn and i am committed to supporting munich holding make sure you don‚Äôt move munich so that it can take my support,1,True,1,italy,germany,1,41,Fall,1903
okay can do thanks,1,True,-1,germany,italy,1,42,Fall,1903
i suggest that you order kiel support berlin holding berlin support munich holding helg to holland munich support berlin holding,1,True,1,italy,germany,1,43,Fall,1903
i agree completelyalthough i didnt know that a country could hold and support at the same time thanks,1,True,-1,germany,italy,1,44,Fall,1903
thanks italy hope youre enjoying the weather on the anatolian üòâ,1,True,-1,germany,italy,1,45,Fall,1903
i will be supporting munich to hold again and i‚Äôll be trying to get russia to back off your flank and protect himself against an austrian stab that is coming,1,,2,italy,germany,1,46,Spring,1904
two bits of advice 1 i suggest you tell russia that austria is coming for him you really want russia to move sil back to gal you might also suggest to russia that is he supports you to denmark you will then support russia back to sweden i don‚Äôt know yet if it actually makes sense to do that but you want russia thinking that you are eager to work with him he‚Äôll be hoping for a reason to break off his attack on you at this point,1,,2,italy,germany,1,47,Spring,1904
2 here is the move set i would suggest right now kiel support holland holding holland support wales to belgium tell england you are going to order this support and he can take it or leave it munich support berlin holding berlin support munich holding  i think that both france and russia are about to back off you as they are both under fire at home just hold still and soon you should be able to break out of this holding pattern,1,,2,italy,germany,1,48,Spring,1904
god i hope so im attempting to make that deal with russia nowand im talking with england re belgium,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,49,Spring,1904
it‚Äôs none of my business but if you do plan to take denmark i strongly recommend you wait until fall i think the most important thing for you right now is getting england fully committed against france if that happens taking denmark later will be easy,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,50,Spring,1904
i think me and england are really on the same page at this point regarding france im actually sort of running counterintelligence for england and my friends to the south of course with russia right now   england and i talked about denmark tooand it seems like one or the other of denmark or belgium should work out for me this year and im fine with that,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,51,Spring,1904
great to hear thank you,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,52,Spring,1904
do you need me to disrupt bur this year ill need to seriously trust russia if im going to risk not holding my eastern front i think,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,53,Fall,1904
i do think a move to burgundy makes sense for you this turn and i can‚Äôt imagine russia attacking you here he has a serious austria problem   i suggest this mun  bur ruh  bel hol support ruh  bel  ber  kie  tell russia that the last thing in the world you want to see is austria run him over and you‚Äôre willing to help keep russia viable if necessary you‚Äôre angling for russia to disband his northern holdings this turn,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,54,Fall,1904
and ask england nicely to support ruh  hol with the explanation that you don‚Äôt plan to ask for denmark back but you think it would help you both to diminish france you‚Äôll get den back eventually but you want england to think you don‚Äôt care about it,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,55,Fall,1904
thanks ill work on these  why didnt you scooch into the aegean behind austria you could have defended or even held bulgaria this turn,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,56,Fall,1904
england and i were talking about your moves for this seasonwhat do you think of convoying pie into spa supporting this with wes and then moving tyr into pie,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,57,Fall,1904
this leaves marseilles open for bur to fall into if france goes that route which gives me an opening into bur,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,58,Fall,1904
that‚Äôs not bad,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,59,Fall,1904
i was kind of thinking i should pick one or the other of marseilles or spain to attack and not tell a soul which one i‚Äôm going after,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,60,Fall,1904
do you really think it‚Äôs important to coordinate,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,61,Fall,1904
i do think you‚Äôre best off moving to burgundy and there is some chance that we fail this turn but i think we just take a guess and hope for the best we‚Äôll get him next turn if not this one,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,62,Fall,1904
okay‚Äîsorry for being nosy i will try for bur on the off chance it shakes out that way,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,63,Fall,1904
nah you‚Äôre not being nosy at all i mean come on we both know that i have no problem sticking my nose where it doesn‚Äôt belong,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,64,Fall,1904
marked as true,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,65,Fall,1904
i like to coordinate but on these sort of 5050 guesses i kind of like to keep it secret so that if it doesn‚Äôt go well i have nobody to blame but myself,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,66,Fall,1904
ha,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,67,Fall,1904
well are you willing to humor my question about the aegean anyway,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,68,Fall,1904
sure i was thinking of moving that fleet to ionian you think a move to aegean is better i‚Äôm not really sure but let‚Äôs talk it through,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,69,Fall,1904
no sorry i meant in hindsightlike this past turn you should have moved to aeg so that this current turn when austria takes rumania from bulgaria youd be there to cover bulgaria so it couldnt get scooped by the black sea and potentially youd just get to take it,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,70,Fall,1904
not a bad point i agree,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,71,Fall,1904
hmmmm kind of a pointless lie if you ask me but i won‚Äôt hold it against you you‚Äôre in a tough spot,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,72,Winter,1904
um what lie i did exactly the moves you suggested,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,73,Winter,1904
ha so sorry i meant that for france,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,74,Winter,1904
you are my favorite,1,False,2,italy,germany,1,75,Winter,1904
marked as lie because clearly austria is your favorite speaking of i assume that your seizing trieste was mutually agreed upon,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,76,Winter,1904
yes ‚Äî agreed upon,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,77,Winter,1904
thats not what austria said to england,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,78,Winter,1904
hmmmm okay well let‚Äôs just keep that between you and me then ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,79,Winter,1904
you know italy i think we do need to coordinate your move this timeengland and i have a shot at either bur or mao if one of marseilles or spain can be left open for france to fall into this will improve all of our chances of crushing france quickly,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,80,Winter,1904
okay i can dig it what do you want me to do,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,81,Winter,1904
let me confer with england and get back to you glad to hear that though,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,82,Winter,1904
soany thoughts on how to approach this,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,83,Spring,1905
it looks like englands not willing to try for mao if it means possibly losing the channel however theyll bring the nwg fleet around to try for mao next year  so if you could keep marseilles open it will help me to try and take burgundy this turn,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,84,Spring,1905
if i leave marseilles open would you kindly use burgundy in the fall to help me take marseilles likely that means ordering burgundy to gascony to cut support,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,85,Spring,1905
will do,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,86,Spring,1905
okay so i still have a teensy little bone to pick with you on the offchance that austria wasnt lying and you did take trieste unexpectedly i sort of worry that i might be next are you willing to tell me what your plans are for the tri unit or at least to warn me before any move into tyrolia,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,87,Spring,1905
sure but you‚Äôll see from my moves this turn that austria is lying to you,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,88,Spring,1905
i currently have tri  tyrolia i like the unit there because it sets up an attack on austria if i ever want to go that route build a ven and go east do you want me to keep tyrolia clear,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,89,Spring,1905
i‚Äôll add ‚Äî i would never attack germany as italy setting myself as a giant column like that is just not defensible it would be a terrible move,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,90,Spring,1905
not when that column is notsogiant and in a turf war with france,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,91,Spring,1905
oh you mean setting yourself,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,92,Spring,1905
but you could easily pick off say munich and not be a giant column,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,93,Spring,1905
i mean this sincerely any germany who does that is a terrible player   why would i do that i would need 23 units to hold one center that is a net negative and all of your units are doing things that are good for me in containing your neighbors   i‚Äôve been working hard in this game for you to succeed and knock back france and england i can say with 100 certainty i‚Äôm not going to attack you i‚Äôm going to keep helping you as much as i can,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,94,Spring,1905
that said if you want me not to move to tyrolia i won‚Äôt move there,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,95,Spring,1905
nah i just needed some reassurance  your logic is undenyable‚Äî enjoy your stay in tyr,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,96,Spring,1905
undeniable that looks better,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,97,Spring,1905
i mean it sincerely i think that england will want to coax me to attack you with him after france falls but i‚Äôd much rather work with you against england   but first thing‚Äôs first ‚Äî let‚Äôs get rid of france,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,98,Spring,1905
agreed,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,99,Spring,1905
on the france part,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,100,Spring,1905
sorry i wont be able to cut off gascony this turni probably should have just told you my moves you could have advised me that supporting munbur was more important than kieruh,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,101,Fall,1905
no worries we‚Äôll crack this but eventually   here is my suggestion for this turn kie  den hol s bel holding bel s ruh  bur mun s ruh  bur ruh  bur,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,102,Fall,1905
i think you should suggest to england that he gets sweden and st petersburg while you get denmark back that‚Äôs only fair as you have been a loyal ally in the fight against france and you plan to continue to do that,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,103,Fall,1905
the moves i had already planned differ in one respect i thought it would be worth the risk to try moving holbel and therefore move belbur even if me and france are highfiving in bel for a few seasons its still mine and its not like holland has anything better to do while im still allies with england  the only reason im reluctant to make that agreement with england is thatwhile i think you and i have a good relationshipi really have not talked with austria much at all and im the next logical target for them when russias gone and anything thats bad for russia right now is good for austria,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,104,Fall,1905
hmmmm i‚Äôm just not sure you should trust england enough right now to leave holland open and belgium essentially unguarded   france is a really good player and he is no doubt working hard to get england to turn on you my personal take is that you are better off being a bit more conservative until you have denmark back and england has moved another fleet towards france but i can see it either way,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,105,Fall,1905
with regard to russia talk it through with england what you don‚Äôt want is england taking out russia and giving you nothing so if england agrees to let russia be for a while then your plan sounds good but if england is going to take sweden you really should get denmark back i‚Äôm my view,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,106,Fall,1905
okay youve convinced me its worth figuring out what es plans are for russia at least  and youre almost certainly right from a rational perspective about leaving hollandbelgium vulnerable to england but i think england really is counting on my assistance in taking france and because of that and other nonquantifiable reasons i trust them,1,True,-2,germany,italy,1,107,Fall,1905
excellent obviously you have a much better feel for your relationship with england than i do just know that france is persuasive and i‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs working on he stopped talking to me so i bet he‚Äôs trying to turn england just keep reassuring england that you want to work with him longterm so he doesn‚Äôt succumb to the dark side,1,True,2,italy,germany,1,108,Fall,1905
hi germany ‚Äî well i think we‚Äôre getting to a critical point in the game here france held out a long time but he‚Äôs much less of a threat now i think the critical issue for you is england   i have some thoughts on the matter and some information but i‚Äôd like to feel confident that you and i will keep anything we say between us i think of you as the one person who has been honest with me on every turn you even tell me the truth when it‚Äôs bad news or when you don‚Äôt completely trust me and i like that,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,109,Winter,1905
okay italy i wont share any of this conversation but in the interest of continued full disclosure heres what i think england is a greater threat to me on the map but you have a greater chance of soloing this game quickly or pairwinning with austria even sooner and if i continue to collaborate with england we at least have a chance of slowing that down so im in sort of a conflicted spot,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,110,Winter,1905
this is why i like you the full disclosure part you tell me the truth even when the news isn‚Äôt great,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,111,Winter,1905
my thoughts on the ‚Äúgermanyengland forever so that at least we can stop the solo‚Äù strategy 1 it‚Äôs quite early to be talking about solos i am at 8 and austria could take 3 from me any time quite easily 2 i don‚Äôt think england is thinking that way i think he‚Äôs thinking that a dominant power will emerge in the north and one will emerge in the south and he‚Äôs like to be that dominant power,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,112,Winter,1905
england‚Äôs pieces are not positioned well if he‚Äôs trying to attack france or contain italy he keeps denmark guarded and north sea filled he is not playing like he intends to stick with you even though i‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs telling you that,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,113,Winter,1905
you‚Äôre right that you don‚Äôt want to start a war with england right now but you must stick up for yourself because nobody else will do that if you don‚Äôt,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,114,Winter,1905
if i were you this is what i would do 1 keep warning england about the dangers of italy getting too big and insist that england moves his fleets towards mao channel to irish norwegian to nao north  channel 2 insist on taking denmark back,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,115,Winter,1905
i would say something like this  england i‚Äôm with you my friend but we‚Äôre passed the stage of you needing to keep me under lock and key i need to take denmark back i‚Äôm happy to support you to brest to keep you growing or you can grab sweden you have plenty of options other than keeping your ally‚Äôs center but if you really want to be my ally longterm you‚Äôve got to show me that,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,116,Winter,1905
i am hearing from england signs that he may be thinking of attacking you soon and i think you actually avoid that better by being strong and sticking up for yourself rather than being accommodating and letting him do whatever he wants to do,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,117,Winter,1905
well both you and france have now pointed out that england is strategically not in a good place to be my ally right now and you are correct ill be more cautious with my northern border but i made a pretty strong argument for denmark this past turn and it fell on deaf ears,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,118,Winter,1905
which probably also should have been a sign for me,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,119,Winter,1905
well if you want you could just take denmark this next year and i don‚Äôt think england is in a position to retaliate,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,120,Winter,1905
probably nothas france been talking with you at all about their sunsetting strategy theyve indicated a willingness to work with you and me and a desire to see england get as few dots as possible,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,121,Spring,1906
he did say that to me too though france has a long history of lying to me so i really don‚Äôt trust him,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,122,Spring,1906
well france has actually been pretty honest with me and i at least am certain that they wouldnt betray me to england so im considering working with f to sabotage or potentially fullon backstab england this turn which would have the sideeffect of maybe taking some attention away from the south for you anyway,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,123,Spring,1906
and id be interested to hear your thoughts on this if youre in the mood to give out free advice,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,124,Spring,1906
hi germany ‚Äî sorry for the delay welli think it‚Äôs really important that you get a build this turn either way i don‚Äôt think england will get a build this turn so if i were you i‚Äôd probably take paris build a fleet and move on england after that,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,125,Spring,1906
but it likely depends on how communication is going with england if he‚Äôll give you back denmark that might change the equation,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,126,Spring,1906
i am waiting on england to make a decision about thatthey claim to be thinking about it,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,127,Spring,1906
england told me you said i was plotting with france it makes sense you‚Äôd want to pit us against each other,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,128,Spring,1906
hey ‚Äî tried to send you a message earlier but not was down england was telling me that you‚Äôre saying that i told you that england is plotting against you the problem with telling england that is that he will stop giving me useful info,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,129,Spring,1906
truly i don‚Äôt want you and england to fight i am not trying to break you up i suggested that you take paris i want you guys to work together with me against france,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,130,Spring,1906
you dont want us to fight yet you betrayed both of our confidence with you in a way that makes us distrust each other,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,131,Spring,1906
i really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a fair description you guys both wanted to attack each other i encouraged you both to keep working together,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,132,Spring,1906
just as long as it suits you are you going to give england mao,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,133,Spring,1906
hmmm should i be reading that as angry sarcastic with dagger eyes i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôm getting your tone right,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,134,Spring,1906
we‚Äôre friends right i believe that every single message i‚Äôve sent you all game has been truth and i‚Äôve gone out of my way to give you candid advice are we still friends,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,135,Spring,1906
regarding mao ‚Äî i don‚Äôt know what do you want me to do i don‚Äôt have any set plan,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,136,Spring,1906
yep theres some sarcasm there looking back at your messages i still dont read them as encouraging collaboration and if you wanted us to be friends you could have done that without betraying me to england by simply saying in your candid way i dont think you should do that for such and such reason but you chose to increase es distrust of me so i think you might be full of gnocchi and crap   my trust in you is a bit shaken but i still think we can have a working partnership with a bit more caution on my end it would be my preference that you hold mao on the assumption that if it came down to a choice between partnering with me or england youd choose me if thats not the case then as the filling of an englanditaly sandwich im in no position to retaliate anyway,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,137,Spring,1906
well again i like that you‚Äôre honest with me even when the news is bad,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,138,Fall,1906
i have to say that i‚Äôm surprised that you feel that i‚Äôve betrayed your trust i have been feeling like maybe i‚Äôve been too helpful to you and been a bit over the top in offering advice etc but it seems like i‚Äôve misread the situation,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,139,Fall,1906
no its completely true that youve been too helpful and im really really grateful for it because ive been able to learn so much from this game but its also true that you didnt have to tell england what you did and all you stood to gain from it was that it shook my and es trust in each other,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,140,Fall,1906
but i understand what you‚Äôre saying and i much prefer to have a heart to heart like this a frank airing of grievances rather than being surprised by unkind moves on the board httpsyoutubexoirv6bbjog,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,141,Fall,1906
was not expecting seinfeld today and it was a pleasant surprise,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,142,Fall,1906
ü§ó,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,143,Fall,1906
here‚Äôs the deal i like you better than england,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,144,Fall,1906
i‚Äôm not sure how the next couple of turns are going to shake out but i like that you tell me when you‚Äôre angry with me i know that may seem like a small thing but it‚Äôs just rare in diplomacy you get so many fake smiles,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,145,Fall,1906
so if it comes down to you or him i‚Äôm choosing you and i‚Äôll work to do a better job of keeping your confidence i certainly understand how important that is as i hate it when people o that same thing to me,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,146,Fall,1906
so no more playing mediator for me,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,147,Fall,1906
okay is it true that you want the channel,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,148,Fall,1906
and are you planning to keep vienna,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,149,Fall,1906
i am not planning to keep vienna and yeah i‚Äôve asked france for support to the channel do you think he‚Äôs on board,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,150,Fall,1906
im not sure is england on board is this something england can know about,1,,-3,germany,italy,1,151,Fall,1906
no do you think france will support me to the channel,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,152,Fall,1906
france has asked my opinion on it and i havent given it yet to my estimation things look a lot better for me if you dont end up there i dont want to see england in mao and i dont want to see you snagging pieces of the north,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,153,Fall,1906
okay well here is my thinking tell france whatever you want to make him happy then tell me how you really feel and if you don‚Äôt want me to go there i won‚Äôt go there,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,154,Fall,1906
if i hadnt asked you about it would that have just been another surprise too,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,155,Fall,1906
absolutely   you and i have discussed our moves and been honest with each other every turn but we have not been sharing all our moves or preclearing all of our moves so that would have ben a surprise in the same way that your moves are a surprise to me i never tell you what to do or insist on knowing,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,156,Fall,1906
i kind of thought that you would have wanted me in the channel because it commits me further against england but i can understand what you‚Äôre saying now about wanting me to hang back,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,157,Fall,1906
but i don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with me contemplating moves without telling you all of them you asked me about it and i told you the truth,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,158,Fall,1906
i do think that this move is a breach of general expectation which is the kind of thing id like to know about and its also the kind of thing ive shared with you case in point my desire to stab england,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,159,Fall,1906
okay understood,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,160,Fall,1906
is there anything i could gain from seeing you in the channel would you support me taking nth and potentially seizing the island,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,161,Fall,1906
heres what im thinking i would be on board with you taking the channel and id give france the green light to go ahead with it if you would agree to bump nao out of mao using wes and if youd be open to supporting some antienglish aggression while holding the channel so that i can get on equal footing with you dotwise  if you dont want to agree to those terms thats okay but i would strongly prefer not to see you in the channel in that case,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,162,Fall,1906
i‚Äôm going to be out of pocket this weekend so let‚Äôs talk this through more on monday generally i agree that i‚Äôll either stay out of the channel or agree to your terms for entering there,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,163,Fall,1906
if you decide to stay out of the channel i have a deal that i like with england in the works for that deal to go through youd have to agree to move mao into portugal to let england take mao would you be amenable to that,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,164,Fall,1906
if this second offer is more to think about than a nobrainer you can just mull it over and let me know monday,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,165,Fall,1906
so here is my concern with the england offer if i‚Äôm taking portugal why do we want england in mao and why would he want to go to mao i‚Äôm not sure i understand that one can you explain,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,166,Fall,1906
well when i initially proposed the deal i had forgotten that portugal was promised to england then england agreed to it on the condition that you would confirm that move so i figured e thought you would just move out of there next year but now that i think about it it‚Äôs probably worth asking england why they‚Äôd agree to that,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,167,Fall,1906
i‚Äôd prefer that you not tell england i am considering moving to the channel i don‚Äôt think he would like that,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,168,Fall,1906
i don‚Äôt really want to discuss this stuff with england at all,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,169,Fall,1906
well england changed their mind about the plan i offered anyway so are you taking the channel,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,170,Fall,1906
no i‚Äôm not taking the channel,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,171,Fall,1906
okay was that a recent decision because like an hour ago france said they were supporting you into the channel,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,172,Fall,1906
well when i tell you what i plan to do do you turn around and tell france this makes me uncomfortable speaking with you,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,173,Fall,1906
i havent spoken to france since then i didnt realize you were giving the two of us different information on this particular subject but i dont think ive revealed anything to them about what you plan to do mostly because you havent told me,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,174,Fall,1906
well i have been honest with both you and france you told me that i need to promise you a set of things in order to take the channel i felt like it was more than i could be sure of doing so i am not entering the channel i won‚Äôt go there without your permission,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,175,Fall,1906
i appreciate that and ill keep the remainder of this conversation between us unless i hear otherwise have you just recently made an agreement with england,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,176,Fall,1906
i heard as much but i want to verify the contents of that agreement with you,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,177,Fall,1906
btw france just said that they submitted the orders to support you into the channel,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,178,Fall,1906
i don‚Äôt have an agreement with england but he is asking me about my moves and trying to get my help,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,179,Fall,1906
okaythen england is lying to me saying that youre helping support engbrest,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,180,Fall,1906
ha yeah fat chance,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,181,Fall,1906
but did you lie to england about that or can i say to england that i dont think youll actually provide that support,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,182,Fall,1906
what is paris up to,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,183,Fall,1906
i suggest you just not tell england anything about my moves,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,184,Fall,1906
do you want me to support england to brest,1,,3,italy,germany,1,185,Fall,1906
i guess i‚Äôm not sure what your goals are here,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,186,Fall,1906
i just kind of feel like you‚Äôre grilling me with a lot of questions but not telling me what you‚Äôre doing or what you want from me,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,187,Fall,1906
if you support engbrest england has agreed to vacate denmark for me if you dont i wont get in the way of your channel thing any other questions,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,188,Fall,1906
i have no sense of what you want or what your plan is but i thought id been pretty clear i want denmark i am reluctant to see you in the channel if england remains powerful but happy to see you there if they are weakened,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,189,Fall,1906
can‚Äôt you just force denmark,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,190,Fall,1906
not without risking a swipe of belgium,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,191,Fall,1906
and why force when you dont have to,1,,-3,germany,italy,1,192,Fall,1906
okay i‚Äôll support england to brest you take denmark,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,193,Fall,1906
and you and i should be in position to take out england next year,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,194,Fall,1906
splendid,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,195,Fall,1906
glad everything worked out üòÉ,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,196,Winter,1906
üëç,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,197,Winter,1906
congratulations on retaking denmark and getting two builds you are playing really well right now respect,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,198,Winter,1906
congrats on having doubledigit dots i have some thoughts about taking out england if you want to go fullstab this season,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,199,Spring,1907
i think i do ü§´,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,200,Spring,1907
what are you thinking,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,201,Spring,1907
one option is to take the channel another is to take brest between you me and picardy we can manage either but its a question of which takes priority if we chose brest i could also take a stab at seizing nth this season then we could try for the channel in fall or we could do channel first brest second,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,202,Spring,1907
yeah that is all along the lines of what i‚Äôm thinking how demanding does france sound right now does he want to be the one who takes brest,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,203,Spring,1907
havent asked but in general not demanding,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,204,Spring,1907
good  still i think we should show him some good faith by supporting him to brest in spring we can decide in fall whether it makes more sense for you to take it but i think we want to keep france hungry,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,205,Spring,1907
i would suggest something like this to ensure the english fleet is disbanded pic  bre mao  channel par s pic  bre,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,206,Spring,1907
and spa  gas to cut off that retreat,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,207,Spring,1907
you can take the north sea on the same move and set up a convoy to the english mainland   checkmate,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,208,Spring,1907
okay i like the plan ive asked france if theyre willing to move to brest supported by me,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,209,Spring,1907
arent you concerned about england taking mao id sooner just have you pile on support into bre so that wes can support mao holding,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,210,Spring,1907
that‚Äôs a good point but the problem with that approach is that brest is not guaranteed if england cute mao and supports with the channel the attack fails i think we are better off ensuring that the brest fleet is disbanded if we disband that fleet and take north sea an english fleet in mao really just spreads him out and allows you to take the island faster it‚Äôs not like he can get portugal or spain,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,211,Spring,1907
okay but that means id prefer to take brest myself this spring if france is okay with it,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,212,Spring,1907
i think that we should offer france brest in spring that ensures that he is with us then if conditions are right in the fall i can support you into brest butengland can offer france belgium and i think he is sure to take that if we‚Äôre not even offering him a center right,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,213,Spring,1907
better to keep france feeling like we‚Äôre going to keep him in the game if you need the build in fall it‚Äôs easy for me to support you there,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,214,Spring,1907
i guess i‚Äôm just wondering from france‚Äôs perspective why they‚Äôd want to stay in the game isn‚Äôt it possible they‚Äôd rather move on with their life that‚Äôs not rhetorical i‚Äôm wondering what your perspective is as a veteran player,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,215,Spring,1907
here is my take if france just wanted to go down in a blaze of glory and say ‚Äúeff you‚Äù to england he would have kept irish sea he kept pic which is next to his home center and gives him a chance to negotiate with both you and england,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,216,Spring,1907
i think that means he is motivated to keep trying and if he believes he can get brest he could legitimately get back to his feet i know that‚Äôs what i‚Äôd be trying to do in his position,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,217,Spring,1907
as the poker saying goes ‚Äúa chip and a chair‚Äù so long as you have one chip left and you‚Äôre still in the tournament you can always come back to win,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,218,Spring,1907
thoughts,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,219,Spring,1907
i think that makes sense are you talking with england at all,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,220,Spring,1907
i‚Äôm pretty wary of england right now he asked me what i want to do but i feel like he‚Äôs trying to get me to leave mao open that‚Äôs not terrible news as it suggests that he won‚Äôt expect your move to north sea,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,221,Spring,1907
as long as he doesn‚Äôt move nao to norwegian you‚Äôve got a guaranteed supply center,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,222,Spring,1907
well ed have to be a right dolt not to retreat to nwg and right now theyre talking to me about supporting a move from bre to gas the better for the two of us to stab you,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,223,Spring,1907
what i mean is theres a good chance that mao is safe if i agree to that deal,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,224,Spring,1907
oh nevermindtheyre not going to convoy into brest so actually this pretty much guarantees that eng and nao will try for mao,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,225,Spring,1907
ahhhh sneaky devil thank you for letting me know,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,226,Spring,1907
i still like our plan,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,227,Spring,1907
i need to run for a bit i‚Äôll be around in a few hours,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,228,Spring,1907
i think that knowing this you should do as i suggest and not poke eng just hold and let wes support i am 94 sure i can trust england to do as they say on this one,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,229,Spring,1907
okay should i support pic to bre,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,230,Spring,1907
yes please itll do us good with france too if we both support,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,231,Spring,1907
üëç,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,232,Spring,1907
actually you should use mao to support spagas since we know that brest is moving there it will be beneficial to have you there if we decide to oust france from bre in fall,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,233,Spring,1907
consider it done,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,234,Spring,1907
hmmmm heading anything from england,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,235,Spring,1907
i‚Äôd love to talk if you‚Äôre there i‚Äôm getting the impression that england may actually be moving on you and i think i have a good counter but i also still think we should support the attack on brest and take north sea,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,236,Spring,1907
i definitely think you should keep your moves the same,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,237,Spring,1907
nice get‚Äôem he was moving on you but we should be able to take about 3 off of him now very nice turn,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,238,Spring,1907
sorry i was asleep by 9 last night üòÇ    why the move to nao wouldnt iri be the more antiengland choice  with the move to picardy and assuming a retreat to ska it looks like england has me pretty powerless this turn,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,239,Spring,1907
so do you it seems if you have some kind of deal with russia about munich,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,240,Spring,1907
good morning   just responding to your messages above i think nao and irish are equally antienglish they both give me a clear lane to attack liverpool i wasn‚Äôt sure if either one would be left open but i took a gamble and it paid off,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,241,Spring,1907
re your move this turn i don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre powerless you should get a build i think and if not you should be in position to smash england,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,242,Spring,1907
i don‚Äôt have a deal regarding munich germany frankly i thought you would be a bit more joyful towards me by attacking england i have committed completely to working as your partner,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,243,Spring,1907
i suppose youre right initially i was thinking iri also gives you channel access but nwg access may be just as useful   well when you control half a continent and even more when you consider your influence over me austria and who knows who else theres no such thing as complete commitment im not so naive as to think your allegiance with me is going to last beyond its usefulness and with two fleets on the british isle that time is fast approaching to be clear im still giving you the truth and i still want to work with you but you should really stop acting surprised when im slightly paranoid that a soontobedozendotholder is gearing up to stab me,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,244,Spring,1907
well i dunno it sounds like i should stab you is that what you‚Äôre trying to tell me  i like you i like how hard you‚Äôve worked in this game to rebound from a difficult start i like that you e told me the truth even when the news was bad i like that you tell me when you don‚Äôt trust me i have literally never told you a lie in this game and i don‚Äôt intend to start now last turn i burned my bridge with england beyond repair if you don‚Äôt want to work with me now that‚Äôs really disappointing,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,245,Fall,1907
like i said i do want to work with you however remember that thing i said about general expectations and being warned when theyre broken tyrolia is one of them and i think you knew that and england also told me theyve never told me a lie im starting to think thats diplomacyspeak for when convenient ive used careful wording and halftruths to deceive you even when everything i said was technically true   it would help me to know that you see me being a benefit to you beyond taking out england a natural next move for us would be to take out russia and in that arena i have a positional advantage over you especially if i get two builds this turn ill be able to sneak behind the troops in bohemiagalicia and help you break through,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,246,Fall,1907
yes ‚Äî here is how i expect and hope the game will play out the two of us finish off england and france while drifting towards the east a bit with the builds we get this year we essentially blitzkrieg the east i have more units than you but you have no opposition at all in the north and can take scandinavia war and mos without any trouble,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,247,Fall,1907
i think that in about two years you and i will both be on about 14 centers with the remnants of russia and austria between us and we can decide how we want to resolve it i‚Äôd be happy to agree to a small draw or to shoot for a 1717 twoway draw position whichever you prefer,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,248,Fall,1907
well i like the sound of all of that in fact it sounds ideal theres something poetic about the complete beginner and the expert youve probably heard by now that you got doxxed sharing a victory   i ask for a concession as a show of good will would you be willing to take only one of liverpool or portugal this year i know the portugal request seems weird but i like keeping france around and unless im mistaken they like me better than you üòÉ ,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,249,Fall,1907
yes i wasn‚Äôt planning to take portugal anyway,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,250,Fall,1907
i think it makes sense here for you to land an army in the english island while you can now that his army is off the island he‚Äôs toast as soon as you do that,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,251,Fall,1907
englands just vindictive enough to try and stab belgium with england and picardy though i was planning on keeping holland around as support,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,252,Fall,1907
by england i of course mean eng,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,253,Fall,1907
i suggest the following  gas  liv via convoy spa s mao holding mar hold tyr  tri  hol  yor via convoy bur s bel bel s north hel s north mun  boh par  pic to cut any potential support,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,254,Fall,1907
england cannot take belgium with those moves,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,255,Fall,1907
or i could move my fleet into liverpool and use gas to support bre i‚Äôm happy either way,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,256,Fall,1907
i tried a double convoy in the sandbox once and it didnt work what is this witchcraft,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,257,Fall,1907
at any rate i prefer the fleet move to liverpool and gasconys support into brest and could mao support bre into the channel no sense forcing france to disband bel will support it too,1,,-3,germany,italy,1,258,Fall,1907
here are the orders needed to do a convoy holland move to yorkshire north sea convoy holland to yorkshire  it is not a ‚Äúdouble convoy‚Äù as you only need one fleet to make it happen   but if your fleet in north sea is dislodged the convoy will not go through that is why i would suggest that helg supports north sea holding and belgium supports north sea holding,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,259,Fall,1907
noi mean the one you were planning gascony to liverpool,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,260,Fall,1907
its a double convoy because youre convoying through mao and nao,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,261,Fall,1907
ah the orders there would be gascony  liv mao convoy gas  liv nao convoy gas  liv,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,262,Fall,1907
so i‚Äôll move the fleet to liverpool and you want mao to support paris to brest,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,263,Fall,1907
or wait mao supports brest to channel and gas supports paris  brest right,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,264,Fall,1907
yeah i tried that once in the sandbox or the equivalent back when you had fleets in lyo and wes i tried  a convoy from pie to naf but i think i messed up the commands to the fleets    and yes the most recent message is correct those two things and naolvp,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,265,Fall,1907
okay confirmed   so i‚Äôve got in nao  liv mao s bre  channel gas s par  bre spa  wes mar s gas holding  tyrolia  trieste  sound right,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,266,Fall,1907
it does but if tyr was bound for trieste anyway why did you detour through tyr at all why not just move to trieste last turn,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,267,Fall,1907
austria would not have liked it,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,268,Fall,1907
and he doesn‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs headed back there now please don‚Äôt tell,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,269,Fall,1907
understood me and austria dont talk anyway also do you have any sense of what england is planning to do,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,270,Fall,1907
ha no i don‚Äôt i‚Äôd imagine he is coming for me but i don‚Äôt know that,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,271,Fall,1907
if i were him i‚Äôd defend edi and london,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,272,Fall,1907
so you havent been talking to england at all i was sort of hoping you would know more maybe help us take better advantage of their plans,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,273,Fall,1907
anyway my moves are  parbre bel s breeng hol s bel holding  and the rest within expected parameters correct,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,274,Fall,1907
england has not said anything of substance to me he was gracious about my move but he won‚Äôt trust me again and i would not trust anything he might say at this point i haven‚Äôt asked him about his moves and he hasn‚Äôt told me,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,275,Fall,1907
i thought you would convoy holland to yorkshire and support belgium from burgundy also can you please order mun to boh to cut support and allow me to hold vienna while moving tyrolia to trieste,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,276,Fall,1907
i told you im not risking that convoy and that instead bel is supporting france into the channel which will heretofore be called the french channel and could i persuade you to move to iri instead of taking liverpool in exchange for the requested cut,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,277,Fall,1907
sorry what is the requested cut i understand that you don‚Äôt want me to take liverpool or portugal what are you offering to me i don‚Äôt mean to be difficult i just want to be sure i understand,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,278,Fall,1907
ah you must mean munich to boh,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,279,Fall,1907
asking me to avoid taking por and liv is asking a lot i want france to survive here but i also want england taking units off the board and i feel like you should too right,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,280,Fall,1907
i do but i also want those dots for myself of course and theres still the nonzero chance that youve arranged with boh to take munich for yourself so im taking a serious risk,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,281,Fall,1907
i will avoid taking portugal vacate tyrolia and support you to brest i feel like i‚Äôm offering quite a lot in exchange for one cut support   and cutting that support does not put you in greater peril if i had a deal with russia for munich i don‚Äôt i could cut burgundy from marseilles and support russia to munich moving mun to boh to cut support is costless,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,282,Fall,1907
youre right i just thought id put my best argument forward ill do the cut but i ask for something costless in exchange and i really really want it to stay just between us ok,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,283,Fall,1907
understood and agreed,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,284,Fall,1907
and i have no problem with you asking for more than you‚Äôre willing to settle for that‚Äôs smart and i do the same thing sometimes if you don‚Äôt stick up for yourself nobody else will,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,285,Fall,1907
i know theres more to your relationship with england than youre telling me the last message england sent to me hinted that if i wasnt willing to work with themand i havent said anything to them sincethat maybe you would and if england were to reach out to you youre too smart to just snub them theres advantage to be gainedeither for both of us or just for yourselffrom talking to them the only reason i stopped was because i knew my word would be mud to them anyway  earlier i was hoping youd give me the truth about what you knew and about what they might know but you didnt and that both disappoints and scares me so im asking that you give me just a modicum of honesty here what do you know what does england know,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,286,Fall,1907
i give you my word i don‚Äôt know what england is going to do and i haven‚Äôt asked,0,False,3,italy,germany,1,287,Fall,1907
he is still jovial with me and respectful he has asked me to critique his play and to give him advice but i do not know his moves and i really don‚Äôt think he would tell me them if i asked it certainly would not be info i could trust free i just lied to him about mine,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,288,Fall,1907
but englands desperate better to talk with someone than just go in blind and i doubt theyd turn to russia or france because neither is really close enoughpowerful enough to give real help and theres precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them france  and heres the real accusation for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me youve been sneaky and youve always pitted me and england against each other to your benefit my real fear here is that knowing my moves and with a desperate jovial england seeking your advice it would be so easy to just feed england enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the island   i know this from experience back when you were doing 5050 shots in the south of france i did everything i could to find out what you were planning and feed it to france this was merely a timebuying measure since france was outmatched and i would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move but i wanted to gain more dots before you took over and i assume others are like me hence i suspect you now   im offering this confession in hopes that youll do the same so just come clean and lets approach this thing as equals,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,289,Fall,1907
i am in my car off to pickup my kids from school this deserves a proper response so please give me some time,1,True,3,italy,germany,1,290,Fall,1907
abandon the children this is important üòú,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,291,Fall,1907
so i‚Äôm going to speak frankly here i am rarely offended in a diplomacy game and i rarely say so when i am but this message offends me i‚Äôm trying to think about why i‚Äôm having such a strong reaction to it i think it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre painting a picture of the game both your actions and mine which are totally different than my own perspective continuing,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,292,Fall,1907
from my perspective you were on the ropes early france and england were teaming up on you you lost denmark and france had holland and munich surrounded you were in serious peril   i seriously went to extreme effort to keep you in the game i spent hours talking with england and encouraging him to turn around and go the other way i completely ended my eastern campaign and spent two seasons just making the voyage over to france so that he didn‚Äôt have the bandwidth to continue his attack i have vouched for you with austria and russia many times i have supported munich and i have never attacked you even when people have asked me to do so and pledged to support me,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,293,Fall,1907
i have been honest with you i have worked hard for your success and i‚Äôve made a lot of proposals to you in which you gain centers not me   maybe i am just a bad ally but i‚Äôm not sure i remember an alliance in which i have done more to help my ally truly,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,294,Fall,1907
and to hear that 1 you think i‚Äôve been selfish and 2 you‚Äôve been sabotaging me all along that just doesn‚Äôt sit well with me,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,295,Fall,1907
i have rarely asked for your help and i‚Äôve offered my help freely i‚Äôve provided my sincere best efforts to help you with tactics and i have never sabotaged you not once,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,296,Fall,1907
and if i‚Äôm totally honest with you i could solo this game if i felt like lying to everyone and grabbing dots i think i‚Äôve got you all beat tactically i just have more experience but that‚Äôs not been my intent,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,297,Fall,1907
i‚Äôve spent hours today talking with england about how best to play diplomacy i‚Äôve tried to give him some honest advice because he asked for it but i don‚Äôt know his moves i haven‚Äôt asked for them and i‚Äôm not going to take advantage of that relationship to try to stab you it legitimately did not cross my mind until you accused me of doing it,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,298,Fall,1907
so i‚Äôm frustrated by this accusation,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,299,Fall,1907
and i appreciate all you‚Äôve done for me really i do but ‚Äúcompletely ending your eastern campaign‚Äù is not something you did for me your alliance with austria dictated that  i felt bad for betraying you while i was doing it but even then i knew it was the only way to keep the game going in the face of your and austria‚Äôs might and it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúall along‚Äù it was a few turns at best so that the rest of us would have a shot at you and austria not pairwinning right out of the gate and the only thing that keeps me from thinking you‚Äôre not gonna do just that on the next move anyway is my belief that you really do want the victory all to yourself which is still consistent with everything you‚Äôve done for me propping up a weak player at the expense of stronger ones is a classic tactic continuing,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,300,Fall,1907
and so by the way is trying to shame someone for raising extremely legitimate concerns whenever i bring up suspicion of you you‚Äôre quick to remind me how much you‚Äôve done for me to put me on the defensive and make me feel indebted well frankly that reeks of dishonesty i never asked you to do those things,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,301,Fall,1907
if you no longer trust me so be it i knew that was a risk when i made my confession but i‚Äôd rather have a partnership based on mutual honesty that‚Äôs another reason i confessed‚Äîyou ought to know that my game philosophy new as it is is to trust the map and to trust history first and foremost the parts of your history that i‚Äôve seen indicate that you‚Äôre no saint no matter what you may have done for me and when the map shows that one player is clearly dominating and that player is you you are being deeply naive if you think everyone else is just going to roll over and let you get away with it,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,302,Fall,1907
no all thumbs up from me if i were lying to you i‚Äôd smile and say ‚Äúthat sounds great‚Äù i‚Äôm honest with you because i sincerely thought of us as partners,0,True,3,italy,germany,1,303,Fall,1907
oh but you‚Äôre not you agreed to warn me of unexpected moves then didn‚Äôt when i brought this up you ignored it and misdirected me in hopes i‚Äôd forget you‚Äôve revealed things to england without my permission and then made up a story about it after the fact  and you can‚Äôt be a real partner with someone who is depending on your good graces to survive that‚Äôs not a partnership we could never be real partners unless we had some notion of equality and i‚Äôm outmatched in both skill and numbers  you and austria however were until recently a perfect example of a true partnership dotparity coordinated attacks really beautiful work so don‚Äôt act as if you don‚Äôt know this to be true we were never a partnership of that kind,1,True,-3,germany,italy,1,304,Fall,1907
well this is very disappointing to me and i obviously disagree with the way you are characterizing me and this game   i have a reputation in this hobby for being sincere not for being duplicitous it has always served me well   if you feel that way then me continuing to explain myself isn‚Äôt going to change your mind if you don‚Äôt want to work with me then i can understand that let‚Äôs consider our deals and commitments to be void and let‚Äôs play our games separately   if you have any deal you‚Äôd like to propose i‚Äôll consider them but i won‚Äôt continue to try to help your game if you think i‚Äôm not sincerely trying to be helpful,0,,3,italy,germany,1,305,Fall,1907
well this game just got less fun,1,True,6,italy,germany,1,306,Winter,1907
for you maybe,1,True,-6,germany,italy,1,307,Winter,1907
sent to germany england austria russia so england germany russia y‚Äôall played a great turn last turn you got me to stab my longtime ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7year run as an alliance russia told me he was with me if i stab austria england told me he wanted me to solo so long as i would ‚Äúteach him‚Äù and help his along to second place then y‚Äôall pulled the rug out from under me it was clever and effective end part 1,1,True,6,italy,germany,1,308,Spring,1908
part 2 at this stage my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit and of course i‚Äôm happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for ‚Äúhey i really want you to solo just help me place second‚Äù but if you guys just want to call it a fiveway draw among us and grab a beer together while reviewing the statistics that‚Äôs really my preference   i am outnumbered and i obviously can‚Äôt solo and i‚Äôm sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way but i expect russia and england to be careful and so i‚Äôm not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to germany‚Äôs favor   i propose that we draw and hug it outü§ó,0,True,6,italy,germany,1,309,Spring,1908
im down for a fiveway draw   and by the way england was copypasting to me the most incriminating messages you sent them so i knew you were giving england my moves i do have a certain begrudging respect for you ability to deny though üòâ,1,True,-6,germany,italy,1,310,Spring,1908
well england is telling me he is happy to see me solo and wants second placeso should i say ‚Äúno‚Äù i guess i should have i was happy the way the game was going before all that,1,True,6,italy,germany,1,311,Spring,1908
dont try and pin your greed and deceit on england at least own it when youre ruthless,1,True,-6,germany,italy,1,312,Spring,1908
you have been given an apple laced with poison england‚Äôs only move there was to make you hate me and he did his job well   you should not let your view of me be defined by someone who has an incentive to make you never speak to me again we can talk about it more after the game but i had every intention of continuing to work with you and i would have done that until england made his play,0,True,6,italy,germany,1,313,Spring,1908
i have no doubt you would have continued to work with me but i take issue with someone who can be asked pointblank if theyre sharing moves with another player and lie to my face if youd come clean and explained how what you were doing actually helped me somehow we could have worked together but you would rather have had me in the dark and thats not sustainable in a partnership,1,True,-6,germany,italy,1,314,Spring,1908
i was trying to play both sides and england was lying to me and forwarding my press to try to incriminate me so yes i lied and so did england i apologize,1,True,6,italy,germany,1,315,Spring,1908
will you please either vote to draw or let us know that you‚Äôd like to play this one out i am finding it difficult to motivate myself to speak with anyone if the game is just going to draw shortly thoughts,0,True,6,italy,germany,1,316,Fall,1908
i did vote to 5way draw and i did so again for this season so it‚Äôs not me who‚Äôs keeping this game alive,1,True,-6,germany,italy,1,317,Fall,1908
well as we approach the end of the academic study portion of the game let me say once with the truth detector activated that i really enjoyed playing with you and thought you played really well,1,True,7,italy,germany,1,318,Spring,1910
was it really your first game you definitely played like a seasoned vet,1,True,7,italy,germany,1,319,Spring,1910
i really enjoyed playing with you too and yes it really was my first game thanks for all your help and advice,1,True,-7,germany,italy,1,320,Spring,1910
hello there whats your general plan for this game my inclination when i play austria is to piss off as few people as possible so i dont plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,0,Spring,1901
hi austria nice to meet you and looking forward to playing as your neighbor   hmmmm i hate playing as italy i rarely succeed frankly i‚Äôve recently tried early attacks on austria as italy and it keeps turning out poorly i‚Äôd really like to play this one as a tightknit central trio if you have any appetite for that not sure if i should set up a lepanto or go west but i‚Äôd be happy to hear your thoughts on it,0,True,0,italy,austria,1,1,Spring,1901
that sounds good to me i think probably what would work best is if you and germany go west while turkey and i contain andor eat russia then once ive picked up some russian dots and gotten some good position you split your fleets to help me take turkey and help germany take england,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,2,Spring,1901
i like that let me talk it over with germany,0,True,0,italy,austria,1,3,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm not sure whether germany is keen on attacking france perhaps you and i should focus on turkey,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,4,Spring,1901
yeah honestly the more i think about it the more i think itll just be easier to wipe turkey off the map really quickly ive done it in tourneys a few times before and it just makes everything simpler,1,,0,austria,italy,1,5,Spring,1901
üëå so i‚Äôll open as a standard lepanto sounds good,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,6,Spring,1901
nice start  really glad to see turkey open north and glad to see that you were true to your word with me i feel like we‚Äôre in a really strong position to control the east  what are you thinking,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,7,Fall,1901
yep good start now weve just gotta follow through properly,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,8,Fall,1901
so do i just convoy my army to tunis  also do you want me to bounce you in trieste,1,,0,italy,austria,1,9,Fall,1901
sure trieste bounce is a good idea and yeah standard lepanto with the convoy,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,10,Fall,1901
sohow shall we go about this i‚Äôm kind of thinking that you and i should eat some turkey,1,True,-1,italy,austria,1,11,Spring,1902
thats exactly what im thinking im going to send greece into the aegean you send ionian into eastern med,1,True,1,austria,italy,1,12,Spring,1902
okay cool do you mind if i take greece this year while you take bulgaria that will keep us even and should be guaranteed i can just convoy an army to greece in spring while you move to aegean and i can support you to bulgaria in the fall this also means you don‚Äôt have to rotate your armies all the way to greece which will allow you to mobilize against russia faster when the time comes   thoughts,1,True,-1,italy,austria,1,13,Spring,1902
any thoughts on this idea,1,True,-1,italy,austria,1,14,Spring,1902
i am going to send my fleet over to eastern med and we can work this out next turn,1,True,-1,italy,austria,1,15,Spring,1902
sorry about that today got a little nuts figuring it out next turn is probably the best call once we see whats worked and what hasnt,1,True,1,austria,italy,1,16,Spring,1902
okay thank you for being true to your word   i think we‚Äôre in great shape my major concern on the board right now is ef which is likely going to take down germany quickly and become a major force   it is really important to me to get a build here so that i can try to keep france in check a bit will you agree that you get bulgaria i get greece and we can move forward with both of us at 5  i really think that the two of us can dominate this game if we keep working together,1,True,-1,italy,austria,1,17,Spring,1902
yep im just fine with that,1,True,1,austria,italy,1,18,Spring,1902
great  i will convoy tunis to greece if you can support that move that would be great and it looks like you‚Äôll have no problem supporting greece to bulgaria,1,True,-1,italy,austria,1,19,Spring,1902
ill have a more direct response once the retreats are all resolved and im not extrapolating what the board state will probably be but that seems eminently doable,1,True,1,austria,italy,1,20,Spring,1902
how‚Äôs it looking over there,1,True,-1,italy,austria,1,21,Fall,1902
looking solid i dont think we actually need to coordinate all that much were in a really good position,1,True,1,austria,italy,1,22,Fall,1902
just to be clear should i expect greece will be open,1,True,-1,italy,austria,1,23,Fall,1902
yep it will be ill want it back eventually but for now its yours,1,True,1,austria,italy,1,24,Fall,1902
you sir are a terrific ally this was more than you needed to do but makes me feel like this is really a long term thing thank you,0,True,0,italy,austria,1,25,Winter,1902
we can do great things together long term i figured a downpayment now against that great future would be worth it,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,26,Winter,1902
plus you ever try digging out a talented italy as austria its a pain in the fuckin neck p,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,27,Winter,1902
ü§ó,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,28,Winter,1902
yeah let‚Äôs just work together should be a good one for both of us,0,True,0,italy,austria,1,29,Winter,1902
what should i build i‚Äôm pretty undecided and would be willing to let you choose,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,30,Winter,1902
i think probably a fleet will serve you best in terms of flexibility weve got turkey hes doomed by numbers so you want to start thinking france,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,31,Winter,1902
üëå,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,32,Winter,1902
okay how would you like to approach this turn i‚Äôm at your disposal,0,True,0,italy,austria,1,33,Spring,1903
i think what we do is aeg convoys gresmy with support from eas while bul taps con,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,34,Spring,1903
thats just an initial thought though  if you have a better idea im all ears,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,35,Spring,1903
my concern there is that arm doesn‚Äôt have much to do other than support smyrna and i don‚Äôt know if we want to rely on russia helping i think he has a serious incentive to prevent us from succeeding too quickly against turkey,0,True,0,italy,austria,1,36,Spring,1903
very good point perhaps you tap smy with eas and i use aeg to support bulcon with the intention of then doing the convoy in the fall,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,37,Spring,1903
what do you think of aegean support bul to con while i cut support in smy that is guaranteed so long as russia does not support con back to bul unlikely and we don‚Äôt have to tell russia the complete plan,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,38,Spring,1903
yes we xposted but we are thinking the same way,0,,0,italy,austria,1,39,Spring,1903
well it appears our messages passed each other in the internets series of tubes but great minds etc etc,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,40,Spring,1903
good consider it done,0,,0,italy,austria,1,41,Spring,1903
i‚Äôm thinking about sending an army over to piedmont to keep france honest do you think that is a good idea or a terrible idea i just want to avoid a stampede over germany and i feel like forcing him to use an army in marseilles to bounce with me is worth dedicating one army from me but i don‚Äôt want to antagonize i‚Äôve him either i keep going back and forth about it what do you think,0,True,0,italy,austria,1,42,Spring,1903
i think probably we give france one season to see what they do england build f lon and france built f bre which is something we should keep an eye on before moving,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,43,Spring,1903
okay if he does say anything to you about moving towards me would you please let me know i feel like he‚Äôs in an awfully strong position and it makes me nervous,0,True,0,italy,austria,1,44,Spring,1903
youll be the first to know man isnt this game simpler when youre being honest,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,45,Spring,1903
üëç,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,46,Spring,1903
france says theyre getting radio silence from england which is probably good news for us,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,47,Spring,1903
russia says youre trying to get him to attack me heh,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,48,Spring,1903
that sounds like the kind of thing russia would say   i have generally told russia that i am not close with you and i‚Äôd be willing to attack you but i‚Äôve never ‚Äútried to get him to attack you that is a complete üëé   our alliance seems to be the one trusting alliance in the game everyone is going to try to break us up we need to prevent it,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,49,Spring,1903
thats about what i figured wanted to let you know it was being tried,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,50,Spring,1903
also england is extremely unhappy with france,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,51,Spring,1903
yeah sounds like england is attacking france that‚Äôs good for us we seem to be the only alliance that has its act together,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,52,Spring,1903
which can mean only profit for us as long as we stick together,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,53,Spring,1903
word   listen i‚Äôm an alliance player that‚Äôs how i‚Äôve always been i think it‚Äôs the only way to play i don‚Äôt like to shift around i like a close working relationship with a partner that‚Äôs what we have and that‚Äôs what i plan to stick with as long as you‚Äôll have me,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,54,Spring,1903
til death or end of beta do us part then üòõ,1,False,0,austria,italy,1,55,Spring,1903

you don‚Äôt like it i figured it was the same as venice if i wanted to attack you i could have just moved to trieste any time   my purpose in tyrolia is to keep munich black i‚Äôm just going to support munich holding i don‚Äôt want germany to get trampled,0,,0,italy,austria,1,60,Spring,1903
id have preferred a headsup is all,1,,0,austria,italy,1,61,Fall,1903

okay i‚Äôm so sorry i got distracted again yes i will order gre to smy eas s gre to smy tyr s mun holding   will you allow me a build this turn or do you plan on retaking greece now,0,True,0,italy,austria,1,64,Fall,1903
sounds good to me,1,False,0,austria,italy,1,65,Fall,1903
any word on greece  basically if i get a build this turn i can turn around and smash france if i don‚Äôt that will be a more tepid attack,0,True,0,italy,austria,1,66,Fall,1903
ive got no need to immediately take it since im picking up con,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,67,Fall,1903
okay thank you üòä,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,68,Fall,1903
hey by the way i am going to be candid here i have thought about attacking you i really have but i have recently arrived at the conclusion that this would be a poor path forward i‚Äôm not going to do it   i‚Äôll move on france now that will give you the peace of mind to know that my units will be occupied and far from you,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,69,Fall,1903
glad to hear yep,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,70,Fall,1903
let‚Äôs just keep right on working together and press our advantage b,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,71,Fall,1903
i suggest you move alb to ser and prepare to attack russia in spring,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,72,Fall,1903
you can have ank but i really do think it makes sense that i keep greece ending up with 2 centers from turkeybalkans seems fair with you getting everything else yes,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,73,Fall,1903
yeah i think i can live with that,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,74,Fall,1903
sorry it took me a moment to respond its the mlb home run derby tonight,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,75,Fall,1903
well that i can understand,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,76,Fall,1903
look like i said i was wavering a bit especially during the long weekend but i‚Äôve taken a close look and i just think that this alliance has unique staying power i really do we both have room to grow now that england attacked france there isn‚Äôt really anyone who can stop us this can work long term and work well,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,77,Fall,1903
i wholeheartedly agree neither of us benefits from attacking the other,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,78,Fall,1903
so this one seems easy i‚Äôll support you to ankara and you are guaranteed either ankara or rumania  con  ank smy s con  ank age  con eas s smy holding ven  pie tyr s mun holding tys  lyo tun  wes ser  rum bul s ser  rum bud s ser  rum vie  gal  sound right,1,,0,italy,austria,1,79,Spring,1904
i had already entered every single one of those orders except for aegcon which is in now its nice being on the same page isnt it,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,80,Spring,1904
üëç,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,81,Spring,1904
i kind of figured it‚Äôs a pretty straightforward move for both of us and likely gains for both of us this alliance is in a really healthy place,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,82,Spring,1904
so i assume youre going to support ank to hold,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,83,Fall,1904
also fyi im in transit to skycon out in montana so i might not be the most communicative gent this weekend,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,84,Fall,1904
hi austria i apologize for the delay quite a busy day for me yesterday   i have no problem supporting ank to hold,1,,0,italy,austria,1,85,Fall,1904
i also want to say ‚Äî looks like that support ensures you get two builds my own attack on france is not quite so successful do you mind if i borrow trieste this turn to stay even with you and keep my momentum going west i‚Äôll place another fleet with it which further locks me in moving away from you i think that‚Äôs actually quite good for you but i know some players get prickly about home centers,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,86,Fall,1904
a dot is a dot is a dot its better for the long term health of the alliance and im still building one more importantly your besteasiest route to growth still lies in france not with me so i dont see you having a ton of incentive to go after me go for it,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,87,Fall,1904
omg üòÆ you are my favorite ally of all time this just happened you just past the threshold it used to be this guy who was playing france to my england funny dude great stories but he never sacrificed a home center in the interest of parity   you are a rare gem,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,88,Fall,1904
do you think 1717 is an okay result for a beta test,0,True,0,italy,austria,1,89,Fall,1904
i feel like i can‚Äôt stab you now so i‚Äôd like to simply crush the board with you,0,True,0,italy,austria,1,90,Fall,1904
ive never said no to 1717 lol,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,91,Fall,1904
whats your planned build,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,92,Winter,1904
f nap sound good,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,93,Winter,1904
yeah naples makes it look like we might actually be fighting go for it,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,94,Winter,1904
well i hope you had a nice weekend do you think we have much to discuss here is there anything you‚Äôd like me to do with my three eastern units do you want me to pretend to fight you or shall i just move away or hold still i don‚Äôt really have any idea what i should be doing,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,95,Spring,1905
my weekend was great i placed 8th at skycon which was a disproportionately talented tourney so im feeling quite good about myself id like your army in smyrna to support my move from ankara to armenia but other than that i see no point in pretending to fight each other so i figure you might as well move stuff west to take care of your new main front,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,96,Spring,1905
okay that works for me,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,97,Spring,1905
do you want me to move eastern med to aegean if your move to armenia works likely you may want to use my fleet to bounce with you at con to keep the russian fleet out but totally up to you i don‚Äôt care either way,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,98,Spring,1905
right now ive just got my fleet in con tapping black so itll probably stay full get the fleet where it can help with france,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,99,Spring,1905
thoughts on where we go from here,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,100,Fall,1905
my units are at your disposal,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,101,Fall,1905
i think the best way to take rum would look like this bul  rum ser and bud s bul  rum con  bul ec arm and smy bounce in ank tyr and gal bounce in vienna  anticipating that black sea will likely move to bul to cut support,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,102,Fall,1905
everything still okay,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,103,Fall,1905
i like it yeah lets do that,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,104,Fall,1905
folks are trying to pry us apart but their arguments arent making a ton of sense,1,True,0,austria,italy,1,105,Fall,1905
yeah i‚Äôm getting the same treatment   if we stay together we win together,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,106,Fall,1905
argh i knew black sea would try for bulgaria shoot,1,True,0,italy,austria,1,107,Fall,1905
my wife says i am bossy and uniquely inflexible i don‚Äôt want you to feel that way too how shall we approach this next turn i think we need to put in a good set of orders here to turn the tide against russia,1,True,2,italy,austria,1,108,Spring,1906
heres what ive got right now  a arm  sev f bla  con a bud s gal  rum a gal  rum a rum  bul a ser s rum  bul,1,True,-2,austria,italy,1,109,Spring,1906
i figure if you bounce me in con that piffs the russian fleet,1,True,-2,austria,italy,1,110,Spring,1906
yeah not bad the danger is in rumania are you thinking gal  ukr bud  rum shall i order tyr  vie  i think that is likely best as it keeps russia out of your centers for sure and it should easy to support me out in the fall once russia has one less unit,1,True,2,italy,austria,1,111,Spring,1906
yep that seems like the best course of action,1,True,-2,austria,italy,1,112,Spring,1906
so look i‚Äôm at your disposal in the east i think the best bet may be for you to support me from vienna to galicia but i‚Äôm willing to do something else if you like something else better,1,True,2,italy,austria,1,113,Fall,1906
frankly if i were you i‚Äôd be worried about a stab from italy here ü§≠ but i‚Äôm not going to do that you e been extremely good to me and it would be a very bad time for me to begin a war in the east while all my units are west so you‚Äôre stuck with me as an ally,1,True,2,italy,austria,1,114,Fall,1906
yep that all checks out and i was thinking viegal was the best call so lets make that happen,1,True,-2,austria,italy,1,115,Fall,1906
well that is damn annoying i‚Äôm surprised he tried for vienna ‚Äî would have thought he would go for rumania,0,True,4,italy,austria,1,116,Winter,1906
i do think that we can guarantee you sev this year which should finally crack this nut,0,True,4,italy,austria,1,117,Winter,1906
yeah id also like to address the center imbalance a bit more directly  as you pick up dots in the west id like to start picking greece vienna and ankara back up,1,True,-4,austria,italy,1,118,Winter,1906
er smyrna not ankara,1,True,-4,austria,italy,1,119,Winter,1906
totally agree,1,True,4,italy,austria,1,120,Winter,1906
yes we need to take that in swiftly let‚Äôs see what the builds look like and make a plan,0,True,4,italy,austria,1,121,Winter,1906
hi austria ‚Äî so this is a big turn for us i am absolutely committed to getting you a build i wish we could get you more than one but unfortunately the fact that you lost vienna last turn makes that impossible   so it seems to me that the most important way to get you a build is to take galicia in spring i don‚Äôt care if i move there or you move there but we need to make some room around budapest so that you can build there,0,True,4,italy,austria,1,122,Spring,1907
yeah id appreciate your support from budgal,1,True,-4,austria,italy,1,123,Spring,1907
maybe something like this bud  gal vie s bud  gal rum  sev bls s rum  sev arm s rum  sev bul  rum ser  bud  if the move to gal does not work and you don‚Äôt get sev then in fall you can order bud  tri while vie and ser bounce in bud to ensure you get a build,0,True,4,italy,austria,1,124,Spring,1907
oh yeah that looks better than what i had in mind lets roll with that,1,True,-4,austria,italy,1,125,Spring,1907
üëç,1,,4,italy,austria,1,126,Spring,1907
one tweak i am worried that russia could take rumania with the move set i proposed you can prevent that by having serbia support bul  rum i think that‚Äôs better than ser  bud and it makes sense because you want bud open after the fall anyway that should mean that you won‚Äôt lose any ground this turn and you‚Äôll likely take sev,1,True,4,italy,austria,1,127,Spring,1907
oh yeah good tweak makes sense so ordered,1,True,-4,austria,italy,1,128,Spring,1907
hey ‚Äî man russia keeps guessing correctly i am sincerely sorry that that move did not work   thoughts on what to do this turn i wish england or germany would pick off a russia center in the north but they seem content to let russia put up his road block,0,True,4,italy,austria,1,129,Fall,1907
use tyrolia to tap bohemia vienna supports budapest to galicia and rumania taps ukraine unless bohemia goes to vienna that guarantees a move to galicia,1,True,-4,austria,italy,1,130,Fall,1907
also for my comfort do you mind if i pick trieste back up,1,True,-4,austria,italy,1,131,Fall,1907
i like that i was thinking that you would move bud back to tri but this is much better it keeps forward momentum and yes you should take back tri now that will make builds easier as we move forward,0,True,4,italy,austria,1,132,Fall,1907
also actually i dont have anything for bulgaria to do and youre guaranteed two dots this turn can i take greece back too i can bank a build for the future regardless of what happens and you stay even you dont really need a build right now,1,True,-4,austria,italy,1,133,Fall,1907
hmmm i‚Äôm cool with you taking trieste i‚Äôm not sure that taking greece now is the right move   in the west i will take liverpool but not portugal i need to use my spanish fleet to support mao so that i can convoy an army to liverpool and i‚Äôm just in no hurry to take out france so if you take greece you would be taking an italian unit off the board and not building one yourself,0,True,4,italy,austria,1,134,Fall,1907
also seems like there is plenty of risk that russia could try for rumania why not use bulg to support rum while having rum and bls support arm to sev,0,True,4,italy,austria,1,135,Fall,1907
all that said if you feel like you need to take two from me this turn in order to keep working with me i can live with that,0,True,4,italy,austria,1,136,Fall,1907
the alliance is much more important to me than the dot,0,True,4,italy,austria,1,137,Fall,1907
ill take another look at it and get back to you,1,True,-4,austria,italy,1,138,Fall,1907
oh man i‚Äôm getting a lot of hate mail out west not fun i think germany has a pretty low opinion of me and it sounds like she and russia are developing a bit of a romance   i am totally cool with you taking back trieste this turn and i am thankful that you loaned it to me in the first place but i‚Äôd prefer if you wait to take greece until you can actually use the build it would make things quite a bit tougher for me if i have to take a unit off the board especially if we don‚Äôt get an extra unit in the east to compensate,0,True,4,italy,austria,1,139,Fall,1907
yeah if youre not picking up portugal then ill let greece be,1,,-4,austria,italy,1,140,Fall,1907
argh i blew it  i‚Äôm sorry you were a terrific ally i misread the board and thought that i had a clear solo run england basically told me that he was going to help me solo so i felt like i ought to just go for it he bamboozled me and for me to stab you it was a mistake my sincerest apologies,0,True,10,italy,austria,1,141,Winter,1907
i mean im gonna have to fight you for at least a little bit well see what happens,1,True,-10,austria,italy,1,142,Winter,1907
yeah i get that it makes me sick because it‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôll just get squeezed between me and russia fighting me is not really a path toward viability for you and that‚Äôs my fault   i‚Äôm sorry this happened i really am i misjudged the situation and i fear i‚Äôve ruined both our games if you can stick around and insist on getting some of the fruits of smashing me and not letting russia get them all that would be justice,0,True,10,italy,austria,1,143,Winter,1907
oh im definitely sticking around and if you want to make it easier for me to pick up some dots thatd go a long way to making me more viable and more inclined to resume the alliance,1,True,-10,austria,italy,1,144,Winter,1907
good,1,True,10,italy,austria,1,145,Winter,1907
i‚Äôm game for a draw if you guys want to wrap it up here,0,True,10,italy,austria,1,146,Spring,1908
id take a draw,1,True,-10,austria,italy,1,147,Spring,1908
sounds like germany is the holdout,1,True,10,italy,austria,1,148,Spring,1908
i‚Äôm so mad at myself for taking the bait last turn i had both russia and england urging me to go for a solo and it was just stupid of me to believe them   i‚Äôm going to try to leave both tri and bud open to you this turn all yours,0,True,10,italy,austria,1,149,Spring,1908
sent to germany england austria russia so england germany russia y‚Äôall played a great turn last turn you got me to stab my longtime ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7year run as an alliance russia told me he was with me if i stab austria england told me he wanted me to solo so long as i would ‚Äúteach him‚Äù and help his along to second place then y‚Äôall pulled the rug out from under me it was clever and effective end part 1,1,True,10,italy,austria,1,150,Spring,1908
part 2 at this stage my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit and of course i‚Äôm happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for ‚Äúhey i really want you to solo just help me place second‚Äù but if you guys just want to call it a fiveway draw among us and grab a beer together while reviewing the statistics that‚Äôs really my preference   i am outnumbered and i obviously can‚Äôt solo and i‚Äôm sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way but i expect russia and england to be careful and so i‚Äôm not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to germany‚Äôs favor   i propose that we draw and hug it outü§ó,0,True,10,italy,austria,1,151,Spring,1908
i believe everyone is in for the draw ive got it set and im set for early adjudication,1,True,-10,austria,italy,1,152,Spring,1908
do you think this game is going to draw,1,True,10,italy,austria,1,153,Fall,1908
so did you veto the draw,1,True,-10,austria,italy,1,154,Winter,1908
buongiorno  be kinda nice to know if youre looking to move in a direction  i might be interested in participating in  i fully understand if its too early to know just know that channels and minds are both open ,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,0,Spring,1901

well italy and france are in my opinion some of the best possible partners for russia so how could i possibly turn down such enthusiastic overtures from one of them,0,True,1,russia,italy,1,2,Spring,1901
lovely would you rather we target turkey first or austria i‚Äôm okay either way,1,False,-1,italy,russia,1,3,Spring,1901
to be perfectly honest thats hard to say right now since the decision doesnt really affect my opening moves any the standard southern opening spring moves are equally useful against either one and id likely need to adjust based on what else happens on the spring turn  easiest just to say im opening south flexibly considering the followthrough against either one of them,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,4,Spring,1901
okay fair enough one reason it might matter is because i could open with an aggressive attack on austria if you want to blitz him quickly eg dmz gal and then break it or you could organize a bounce in gal and then not move there on the other hand if you‚Äôd prefer to take out turkey first i could go the standard lepanto route i‚Äôm happy to go either way but i‚Äôd really like to coordinate with you if you‚Äôre game  maybe we both need a fuller picture of what is happening first i‚Äôll begin to reach out to others now,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,5,Spring,1901
sounds great  and heres where its useful to know austria has already indicated a bounce in galicia so opportunity to blitz him through there is severely limited,1,,1,russia,italy,1,6,Spring,1901
okay that‚Äôs good to know thank you i sent austria a general first message offering friendship i‚Äôll let you know how things play out,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,7,Spring,1901
hearing anything interesting both austria and turkey are acting cagey and conservative with me so far,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,8,Spring,1901
hey so austria seems to want to lepanto now   you‚Äôre still the ally i want and i‚Äôd like either to cut down austria quickly or cut down turkey quickly   if we decide to take out austria first i‚Äôd like you to let austria in to gal just tell him this was a mistake this will make it very hard for him to defend against me  if we decide to take out turkey first bounce austria and i‚Äôll open as a traditional lepanto  thoughts,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,9,Spring,1901
lets do turkey first ill bounce galicia,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,10,Spring,1901
üëå,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,11,Spring,1901
hi russia how‚Äôs it going i hope this turn finds you well   i think my move is going to be fairly boring but i‚Äôm still game for some adventure if you have any ideas   also would you mind asking austria for a bounce again in galicia i‚Äôd just like to have a decent sense of what his units are doing   any other thoughts,0,True,-1,italy,russia,1,12,Fall,1901
can do,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,13,Fall,1901
he doesnt seem that interested in a galicia bounce fwiw,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,14,Fall,1901
okay thank you for letting me know that helps,1,,-1,italy,russia,1,15,Fall,1901
i believe that turkey is in for a world of hurt soon i think you just need to expel that yellow army from sev and you should be in for a swift turnaround   let‚Äôs kill turkey and then we kill austria long live wintergreen,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,16,Spring,1902
thats the plan mate,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,17,Spring,1902
that went reasonably well looks like austria is going to pick up greece so get wherever you can get and ill get you into doors where i can,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,18,Spring,1902
obviously bulgaria not greece,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,19,Spring,1902
awesome thank you russia any chance you can tap black sea this turn i‚Äôm planning to take greece but i need austria‚Äôs move to bulgaria to succeed,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,20,Fall,1902
his move is guaranteed,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,21,Fall,1902

hi friend can you please not support england into denmark i think that the last thing we want to see here is ef trample over germany i feel like this is really important thoughts,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,25,Fall,1902
ah i did not see this in time  and one of the upshots was learning that england talks too damn much so i probably wont be helping him much going forward üòÉ,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,26,Winter,1902
i feel like perhaps it‚Äôs time to go all out against both t and a here something like this ven  tri war  gal rum  bls sev s ukr  rum  i may lose greece this year but i feel like it‚Äôs worth it to gain some momentum   thoughts,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,27,Spring,1903
hi russia  my moves very much depend on you here so i‚Äôm looking forward to hearing from you i think this is the right time for us both to hit austria but i‚Äôm not going to do it if you‚Äôre not on board   thoughts,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,28,Spring,1903
hey sorry focused on guests for the holiday im currently ordered to move units around so i can move on austria without moving on him this turn basically getting the fleet out of the way,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,29,Spring,1903
okay let‚Äôs shoot for next turn thank you,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,30,Spring,1903
russia argh  i sincerely want to work with you man truly but if you sell me out and try to use what i tell you against me it makes it really hard   austria went right back to me and told me that you sold me out,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,31,Spring,1903
i want to move beyond this but i need to know that what i tell you stays between us or else i just can‚Äôt trust you and i can‚Äôt speak with you   i‚Äôd like to hear your side of this story and i‚Äôd like to know that you‚Äôre not just going to tell austria again let‚Äôs use this bump in the road as a lesson to work better together,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,32,Spring,1903
eh are you really claiming ive been telling him anything useful given that i said nothing about greece i mean that looked kinda arranged to me but nonetheless i gave him no heads up about your plan to move in which should make it pretty clear i have no intention of passing on potentially useful info to him üòÄ,1,,1,russia,italy,1,33,Spring,1903
so where do we stand now,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,34,Fall,1903
youre in the drivers seat for path forward im going to take ankara i assume youve negotiated the taking of smyrna  austria either needs to be given a path forward or dealt with and england most likely needs dealt with so you have lots of options on path forward and im mostly inclined to ride along as most of my attention is likely to be in the north,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,35,Fall,1903
well here is my honest assessment if you want to work with me you have to commit to attack austria with me if you‚Äôre not interested in that i‚Äôm not going to attack austria and it will basically be his choice whether he wants to attack me next or attack you next,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,36,Fall,1903
frankly i am still a little wary after the last time we discussed this you ratted me out to austria but i can get over that if you actually want to be my partner,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,37,Fall,1903
im still not really sure how you think i rated you out to austria given that ive really told him nothing useful at all  greece was the test of that even though im retrospect its obvious it was an arrangement its also obvious i didnt say anything to him when i thought you were stabbing him,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,38,Fall,1903
but whatever water under the bridge im willing to move on austria as soon as you give the word i thought thats what i pretty much just said ill follow your lead in the south you want to roll lets roll,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,39,Fall,1903
orders are in moves on austria up to you to join in,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,40,Fall,1903
what moves on austria would you like to see and what have you ordered i‚Äôll make the move now if it makes sense if not now then next turn,1,True,-1,italy,russia,1,41,Fall,1903
yeah you missed me after id gone to bed but as you can see i did make the move on him and we are apparently spoiling for a fight  of course with you reoriented the way you are seems unlikely youre on board for continuing that line of discussion,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,42,Spring,1904
well i‚Äôm not completely opposed i build an army in venice after all what are you thinking,1,,-1,italy,russia,1,43,Spring,1904
i mean the only decision point is anksmycon right  thats just a matter of choosing the mover  everything else is straightforward onepower tactics,1,True,1,russia,italy,1,44,Spring,1904
well we should really talk to each other more,1,True,2,italy,russia,1,45,Fall,1905
ya think,1,True,-2,russia,italy,1,46,Winter,1905
fwiw im still on board with cooperating to take down austria if that wasnt obvious,1,True,-2,russia,italy,1,47,Winter,1905
i‚Äôm not sure i can save the bulgarian fleet this turn but i think you would help yourself by taking galicia,1,True,2,italy,russia,1,48,Spring,1906
im not sure you have a vested interest in saving my fleet in any event youd much rather be the undisputed fleet power and thats just fine,1,True,-2,russia,italy,1,49,Spring,1906
well either way i can‚Äôt help but i do think you can take gal without problem,1,,2,italy,russia,1,50,Spring,1906
that was already the plan and then he walked out anyway  anyway my course is both set and obvious so its really just a question of if youre going to take all the free dots üòÄ,1,True,-2,russia,italy,1,51,Spring,1906
will you be around near the deadline this turn,1,True,2,italy,russia,1,52,Fall,1906
monday at noon et  yeah i should be available around that time,1,True,-2,russia,italy,1,53,Fall,1906
üòé,1,True,2,italy,russia,1,54,Fall,1906
hi russia still there,1,True,2,italy,russia,1,55,Fall,1906
russia come back,1,True,2,italy,russia,1,56,Fall,1906
yes im here,1,True,-2,russia,italy,1,57,Fall,1906
cool any chance you‚Äôd like to team up with me and england,0,True,2,italy,russia,1,58,Fall,1906
i mean sure my goal right now is just to hammer austria and that coalition helps further that goal so,1,True,-2,russia,italy,1,59,Fall,1906
cool i expect vienna will be empty this turn boh  vie should be a winner,1,True,2,italy,russia,1,60,Fall,1906
ahhboh  vienna why‚Äôd you try to take it from gal,1,True,5,italy,russia,1,61,Winter,1906
didnt log in fast enough to change it and not really upset about it either  this way my line is still mostly intact which is a bit of a priority until you make an overtly antiaustrian move,1,True,-5,russia,italy,1,62,Winter,1906
fair enough at least you can see that i was sincere,1,True,5,italy,russia,1,63,Winter,1906
aye as was i üòÄ,1,True,-5,russia,italy,1,64,Winter,1906
so how are things going over there comrade,1,True,5,italy,russia,1,65,Spring,1907
i‚Äôm feeling like it‚Äôs just about time for you and me to make things official and go steady,0,True,5,italy,russia,1,66,Spring,1907
i believe that england would like me to support you to munich in the fall and that‚Äôs possible but perhaps getting you to budapest might work out better for you i don‚Äôt know ‚Äî how do you the board right now,0,True,5,italy,russia,1,67,Spring,1907
things are pretty well yes this looks to be the year you can just quietly slip the knife in and take pretty much everything,1,True,-5,russia,italy,1,68,Spring,1907
and im easy either way no need to make that call right now as this is the boring turn for me,1,True,-5,russia,italy,1,69,Spring,1907
wellif i ‚Äútake everything‚Äù then we end up with a boring large draw i‚Äôm not in solo position so believe it or not i‚Äôd rather you get the spoils out east if i get much bigger i‚Äôll be fighting the whole board and i‚Äôll lose that fight,0,True,5,italy,russia,1,70,Spring,1907
well damn guess i cant bamboozle you into that position then ,1,True,-5,russia,italy,1,71,Spring,1907
eh ‚Äî i think it‚Äôs a better position for you to get a bunch of centers and work as a team anyway beats a fiveway draw,0,True,5,italy,russia,1,72,Spring,1907
shall we get you budapest or munich this year,0,True,5,italy,russia,1,73,Spring,1907
i think austria is likely to try to retake some of his centers this year so you may have some openings regardless,0,True,5,italy,russia,1,74,Spring,1907
presumably budapest is the better option but again im not really moving much in the spring so its easy to remain noncommittal on that right this moment unless youre making a hard move right now which i doubt  you also benefit from the likely ability to just walk in on the fall,1,True,-5,russia,italy,1,75,Spring,1907
alright now its specific planning time  and munich clearly doesnt seem to make much sense now,1,True,-5,russia,italy,1,76,Fall,1907
okay let‚Äôs get you into rumania and budapest this turn i think i can do that as austria wants to take trieste and greece which will open up room to maneuver as far as i know ser is moving to tri and bul is moving to gre i think that you can take out budrum with gal  bud supported by vie and sev  rum supported by ukr the trick will be keeping sev safe but i think we can do that too as i can recommend that austria selfbounce there to keep me honest,0,True,5,italy,russia,1,77,Fall,1907
i am picking up some gains out west so i risk a severe backlash if i gain anything in the east  i‚Äôd love to see you pick up two here and take a bit of the pressure off me,0,True,5,italy,russia,1,78,Fall,1907
i can work with that  grrr out tonight so less stability to chat but im with you here,1,True,-5,russia,italy,1,79,Fall,1907
üëå,0,True,5,italy,russia,1,80,Fall,1907
is this thing back on,1,True,-5,russia,italy,1,81,Fall,1907
ah good nice run in the west you have going there,1,True,-5,russia,italy,1,82,Fall,1907
id probably be trying to push a stop the leader narrative right now except mitch hasnt talked to me since i pointed out that rolling on me was only going to net him two dots before he hit a wall and that was two or three years ago so eff him üòÄ,1,True,-5,russia,italy,1,83,Fall,1907
sent to germany england austria russia so england germany russia y‚Äôall played a great turn last turn you got me to stab my longtime ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7year run as an alliance russia told me he was with me if i stab austria england told me he wanted me to solo so long as i would ‚Äúteach him‚Äù and help his along to second place then y‚Äôall pulled the rug out from under me it was clever and effective end part 1,1,,8,italy,russia,1,84,Spring,1908
part 2 at this stage my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit and of course i‚Äôm happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for ‚Äúhey i really want you to solo just help me place second‚Äù but if you guys just want to call it a fiveway draw among us and grab a beer together while reviewing the statistics that‚Äôs really my preference   i am outnumbered and i obviously can‚Äôt solo and i‚Äôm sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way but i expect russia and england to be careful and so i‚Äôm not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to germany‚Äôs favor   i propose that we draw and hug it outü§ó,0,True,8,italy,russia,1,85,Spring,1908
i think most of us have the draw set already,1,True,-8,russia,italy,1,86,Spring,1908
hey italy good luck this game im guessing you and austria will be pals you and france will be rivals,1,,0,england,italy,1,0,Spring,1901
well good luck to you too no idea yet who is a friend have you heard anything interesting,0,True,0,italy,england,1,1,Spring,1901
i have some agreements with france if those are upheld id bet france goes for por and spain in 1901 you might want to ask about whether a fleet gets built in mar during the 1901 build if you havent already as this would be an indicator of aggression towards you,1,True,0,england,italy,1,2,Spring,1901
germany seems like a bit of a wild card havent talked in depth with austria,1,False,0,england,italy,1,3,Spring,1901
do you have any sort of aggression in your opening or are you just planning to be neutral and secure tun,1,True,0,england,italy,1,4,Spring,1901
you know i really haven‚Äôt decided i‚Äôm trying to get clear answers from my neighbors and they are all pretty slow to answer so i really haven‚Äôt decided is there something you want me to do,1,True,0,italy,england,1,5,Spring,1901
well definitely make sure you get your fleet to tun by the fall id like to see you do well as italy is kind of the underdog on the map have you agreed to france about piedmont at all,1,True,0,england,italy,1,6,Spring,1901
no we have not yet talked about piedmont,1,True,0,italy,england,1,7,Spring,1901
well if youre looking to make france a little nervous that would be your move ven  pie rom  ven nap to tys,1,True,0,england,italy,1,8,Spring,1901
then you secure tun with your fleet in the fall for the unit in pie you can decide to bait france into a bounce in mar but then just hold instead france would move from spain to mar and miss securing the fifth supply center this is certainly aggressive but it also keeps you and france on a more level playing field,1,True,0,england,italy,1,9,Spring,1901
well i‚Äôd be inclined to do that if i knew you were moving to the channel and wales if you want for both of us to go all in at the same time then let‚Äôs go,1,,0,italy,england,1,10,Spring,1901
yeah that makes sense unfortunately weve declared a dmz in the channel through 1902 so i cant commit to the stab right now i still dont think its an awful play for you if france gets a fleet in mar and has one parked in spain sc at the start of 1902 thats going to be a little threatening for you,1,True,0,england,italy,1,11,Spring,1901
1 if you‚Äôve declared a dmz then you are in position to do this if you want to do it 2 i‚Äôm not going to attack france on my own,1,,0,italy,england,1,12,Spring,1901
yeah everything youre saying makes sense when i make specific agreements like the dmz i generally try to hold them especially early game honestly id rather the three of us pick apart germany to start maybe we could convince france to help you into munich in the fall,1,,0,england,italy,1,13,Spring,1901
hi england ‚Äî just sort of checking in to hear how things are going how does the board look to you right now,1,True,0,italy,england,1,14,Spring,1902
great time to check in france and germany are in conflict and dont seem poised to collaborate on invading me which im happy about russias looking a little troubled with losing sev you look poised to lepanto to turkey and it looks like youll pull it off without the austrian convoy unless that new fleet is headed west also i feel like you andor austria may have your eyes on munich,1,True,0,england,italy,1,15,Spring,1902
any thoughts here,1,True,0,italy,england,1,16,Fall,1902
just about the state of the board or did you send a message after mine that didn‚Äôt come through,1,,0,england,italy,1,17,Fall,1902
ah i sent a really long message about germany you didn‚Äôt get it,1,True,0,italy,england,1,18,Fall,1902
nah maybe it was a botkiller message,1,True,0,england,italy,1,19,Fall,1902
probably best to split it up,1,True,0,england,italy,1,20,Fall,1902
rats,1,True,0,italy,england,1,21,Fall,1902
here is an image of the message i sent,1,True,0,italy,england,1,22,Fall,1902
i‚Äôve been on pins and needles for two days awaiting a response,1,True,0,italy,england,1,23,Fall,1902
haha sorry about that no image received the bot may not send them through,1,,0,england,italy,1,24,Fall,1902
ahhhhhhh,1,True,0,italy,england,1,25,Fall,1902
now i have to retype itüëéüëéüëé,1,True,0,italy,england,1,26,Fall,1902
i have kind of an odd favor to ask and i happen to know it‚Äôs in your best interest but it will require a big picture longterm sort of view of the game   this is germany‚Äôs very first game of diplomacy and he‚Äôs clearly in over his head you‚Äôre positioned to smash him there‚Äôs no doubt about that but the real winner if you do that is france end part 1,1,True,0,italy,england,1,27,Fall,1902
france has four armies and now he has a wide open runway to roll right over germany if you help him you‚Äôre going to regret it look two game years ahead france is going to be in a crazy good position   on the other hand if you change course now and go get france instead france is never going to be able to build a second fleet he will be so much easier to destroy and germany is so greenhe‚Äôll be much easier to take down second   i justi can see where this is headed i know it‚Äôs attractive just to take that easy build but that is the apple of knowledge and france is the devilish serpent end part 2,1,True,0,italy,england,1,28,Fall,1902
i really really believe that it‚Äôs better for you and me for you to switch course and take out france now i‚Äôd be happy to help and give you most of the spoils and i think this would be a great springboard for a dominant englanditalian alliance that can win this game if only i could get this message to go through end,1,True,0,italy,england,1,29,Fall,1902
all of this is fair i‚Äôm aware that germany‚Äôs a firsttimer and i ran through similar reasoning to yours when trying to choose who to side with,1,True,0,england,italy,1,30,Fall,1902
if i had known where you stood in this it might have swayed my opinion i was worried about you and austria making a play for munich and then russia applying more pressure in the north,1,True,0,england,italy,1,31,Fall,1902
one additional piece of my reasoning is that france is a stronger player than me and others probably know this after germany is gone france is the bigger threat if germany and i had taken france together i would have ended up the bigger threat ie the next target,1,True,0,england,italy,1,32,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm going to get russia in on the german takedown you really think the three of us can‚Äôt handle france together once germany is gone,1,True,0,england,italy,1,33,Fall,1902
can you tell germany to selfbounce in ruhr unless i‚Äôm missing something that line holds until i support into holland which i haven‚Äôt been asked to do yet the french upside to taking on germany can be contained if you get munich out of this do you still think it‚Äôs a bad plan,1,True,0,england,italy,1,34,Fall,1902
i vehemently do not want munich,1,True,0,italy,england,1,35,Fall,1902
also i‚Äôm wayy wrong it‚Äôs a fleet in holland haha,1,,0,england,italy,1,36,Fall,1902
i do think it is a much better plan for both of us to side with germany against france i just think that france could pull in austria or turkey against me and he could pull in russia against you   germany won‚Äôt do that sort of counter,1,True,0,italy,england,1,37,Fall,1902
the more i look at this board the more i want to focus on an ei alliance and i think the only thing standing in our way is france i don‚Äôt see germany as any kind of obstacle at all,1,True,0,italy,england,1,38,Fall,1902
especially given that france is locked into armies right now not fleets i think we would be wasting a real opportunity if we let france grow a bit more,1,True,0,italy,england,1,39,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm sorry i did not come to you with this earlier that‚Äôs just my bad i‚Äôve been kind of lazy and i wasn‚Äôt really sure i wanted to weigh in about the west at all but i‚Äôve changed my mind  i think ei can dominate here but we‚Äôve got to keep france from ever building a second fleet i think that‚Äôs the way that both you and me get really big,1,True,0,italy,england,1,40,Fall,1902
i see your points but a couple of things 1 france has another build guaranteed this year and that will likely be a fleet 2 we may be able to keep france away from all of the german supply centers,1,True,0,england,italy,1,41,Fall,1902
kie and mun bounce in ruh hol cuts support from bel this holds ruh unless france chooses to send bel in and let germany into holland,1,True,0,england,italy,1,42,Fall,1902
this holds the line unless i give support,1,True,0,england,italy,1,43,Fall,1902
what if austria gets munich,1,True,0,england,italy,1,44,Fall,1902
i stabbed germany and so i‚Äôm hesitant to try collaboration now,1,True,0,england,italy,1,45,Fall,1902
ok ok i‚Äôm open to going against france i messaged germany we‚Äôll see how she responds i‚Äôm taking denmark this year regardless the stab on france would involve me taking the channel unexpectedly next spring and helping germany into belgium maybe,1,True,0,england,italy,1,46,Fall,1902
these are all good responses and i get that you don‚Äôt want to turn around and stab france now   i do think that i can help you diplomatically with germany i think that if you really want to work with me and germany i can get g on board,1,True,0,italy,england,1,47,Fall,1902
alright well we can chat next year after builds then i‚Äôm certainly open to it i told germany to not bother saving denmark it‚Äôs guaranteed for me with russian support amd instead do the self bounce in ruh with kei and mun to keep france out cutting support in bel with hol i think that move is important this fall to keep france out,1,True,0,england,italy,1,48,Fall,1902
france just tried to tell me the brest build was antiitalian haha,1,True,0,england,italy,1,49,Spring,1903
funny enough he tells me it‚Äôs antienglish,0,True,0,italy,england,1,50,Spring,1903
haha so are we still both antifrench,1,True,0,england,italy,1,51,Spring,1903
i‚Äôd like to get germany on board with helping me take the channel or at least not stopping me i‚Äôm sure germany would be excited to hit me back though  i‚Äôll play dumb with france for now,1,True,0,england,italy,1,52,Spring,1903
okay i‚Äôll try to get germany on board,1,True,0,italy,england,1,53,Spring,1903
germany seems on board maybe i‚Äôm setting myself up to get stabbed hope i‚Äôm backing the right horse on this one i‚Äôll shoot for the channel in the spring and then we get germany into belgium are you planning to move west,1,True,0,england,italy,1,54,Spring,1903
was hoping to see something a little more antifrench in your moves my homeland is toast if you don‚Äôt put any pressure on france in the south,1,True,0,england,italy,1,55,Fall,1903
hi england ‚Äî i‚Äôm sorry for the delay,1,True,0,italy,england,1,56,Fall,1903
i can move to attack france in the spring if you like for now i think that mobilizing germany to attack france is your best bet and shouldn‚Äôt be too hard,0,True,0,italy,england,1,57,Fall,1903
you know what this isn‚Äôt really fair of me if you will commit to the france attack i‚Äôll move on him now are you ready to go all out against him this could actually work out really well for both of us,1,True,0,italy,england,1,58,Fall,1903
i‚Äôm ready but i may want your advice on some of the tactics my plan is to completely cold shoulder france in negotiations and start an attack we‚Äôll want to get germany on board but i think germany is playing a bit neutral for survival purposes right now,1,True,0,england,italy,1,59,Fall,1903
i agree with regard to germany‚Äôs strategy but i believe he hates france most and he will be with you if both you and i move on france now   france is getting no builds let‚Äôs just put the clamps on now i will move to tys and tun if you will move either to take belgium or to position your fleets at irishchannel   if we both take the plunge there is nothing he can do,1,True,0,italy,england,1,60,Fall,1903
france can support himself into england though and i think he plans to because he was asking for germany to cut support in nth which she plans not to the only way to hold the channel is to support from nth,1,True,0,england,italy,1,61,Fall,1903
into england  into english channel,1,True,0,england,italy,1,62,Fall,1903
im planning army yorkshire to wales which allows for the convoy through the channel next year and allows me to bounce in lvp if france moves to iri,1,True,0,england,italy,1,63,Fall,1903
okay i buy that if you commit to moving the army to wales and you don‚Äôt attack germany  i‚Äôll move on france,1,True,0,italy,england,1,64,Fall,1903
im committed are you planning to cut support in munich for a russian invasion of berlin,1,True,0,england,italy,1,65,Fall,1903
no way i am supporting munich we don‚Äôt want russia or france rolling over germany germany will give us her centers in time let‚Äôs keep them german until that time comes,1,True,0,italy,england,1,66,Fall,1903
can you use den to cut support in baltic if i make sure germany does not retake den,1,True,0,italy,england,1,67,Fall,1903
germany has to do something else with munich to protect ruhr i guess,1,True,0,england,italy,1,68,Fall,1903
go team,1,True,0,england,italy,1,69,Fall,1903
cool let‚Äôs do this,1,True,0,italy,england,1,70,Fall,1903
are you lyo and wes this spring with the fleets and will venice go to pie also what is your communication with france like im in favor of all three of us going totally dark on france until the job is done and at some point we should talk about a fair split of the french supply centers just so theres no surprises,1,True,-1,england,italy,1,71,Spring,1904
yes those are my moves,1,True,1,italy,england,1,72,Spring,1904
and i don‚Äôt have any dialogue with france right now i suppose that‚Äôs lazy you want me to stay quiet or try to feel him out there is no way he will believe anything i say after my last move,0,True,1,italy,england,1,73,Spring,1904
i kind of want to starve him of info i‚Äôm currently giving him radio silence germany is getting some inside info pretending to be friendly etc but that will end shortly assuming i don‚Äôt see a surprise german stab of cutting the nth channel support but i think it‚Äôs unlikely,1,True,-1,england,italy,1,74,Spring,1904
france apparently plans to move out of ruh probably to defend the south france will lose 1 supply center certainly maybe 2 this year,1,True,-1,england,italy,1,75,Spring,1904
what are your thoughts on a divvy up of you in mar and spa me in bre and por and germany in bel and par just thinking long term about who gets what,1,True,-1,england,italy,1,76,Spring,1904
thanks for that info about france   also germany has confirmed to me that they trust you i think you‚Äôre right that there will be no german stab coming this turn,1,True,1,italy,england,1,77,Spring,1904
as far as that divide that generally sounds fair though i find that those kinds of agreed splits rarely come to pass exactly as proposed i may have to turn around and go east if austria stabs me etc,1,True,1,italy,england,1,78,Spring,1904
so i‚Äôd prefer to kind of focus on general principles 1 i‚Äôd like for the dominant alliance on the board to be ei so while i agree we want germany to help us crack this but longer term i think we should plan to divide germany‚Äôs share too the safest divide in that case might leave me with all of iberia while you get most of germany ie you‚Äôre going to need armies,1,True,1,italy,england,1,79,Spring,1904
2 we should focus on parity in other words if i‚Äôm way ahead on centers when france folds you get more of france if it‚Äôs the opposite i get more we just keep checking in and try to balance both centers and growth opportunities and let that guide us,1,True,1,italy,england,1,80,Spring,1904
all of that makes sense we‚Äôll reevaluate as we go i‚Äôd like the promise of belgium and paris to germany to be a consistent one that comes from both of us for the purpose of maintaining german confidence in our alliance in case germany asks you,1,True,-1,england,italy,1,81,Spring,1904
looks like you‚Äôve got a bit of a guessing game on your hands,1,True,-1,england,italy,1,82,Fall,1904
yep was hoping for a guarantee ü§®,1,True,1,italy,england,1,83,Fall,1904
germany and i were thinking to go with spain france is annoyed enough with me that he honestly may go for the channel i‚Äôll be risking the channel by supporting ruh to bel with nth so you can support to spain and then let france into mar from bur instead of bouncing germany will try to sneak into bur from mun then you two could bounce in mun to keep russia out a little complicated but germany in bur next year would be great for us,1,True,-1,england,italy,1,84,Fall,1904
even if things don‚Äôt go our way this fall france will go eventually though the longer france has to stay alive the longer he‚Äôll have to sweettalk germany into turning on us,1,True,-1,england,italy,1,85,Fall,1904
trieste whats up with that,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,86,Winter,1904
i guess it shows commitment to an englishitalian alliance but im a little surprised to see a stab like that this soon,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,87,Winter,1904
not a stab austria offered it to me for the sake of parity,1,False,2,italy,england,1,88,Winter,1904
hmmm maybe i was supposed to keep that a secret i think you need to give austria some ‚Äúthumbs down‚Äù,1,True,2,italy,england,1,89,Winter,1904
can you please not go to austria and tell him that i said the move to trieste was arranged he‚Äôs obviously trying to manipulate you in some way can we just compare notes and try to figure out what he‚Äôs up to without revealing that you and i talk much,1,True,2,italy,england,1,90,Winter,1904
im not going to right now but i also am a little curious why it would matter to you if i told austria that are you telling austria things like i really want the austriaitaly alliance to be the dominant one on the board what is your longterm plan with austria,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,91,Winter,1904
no ‚Äî i just want to know what he‚Äôs up to it‚Äôs not a big deal to me but i didn‚Äôt know he was going to try to pass that off as him getting stabbed so i‚Äôm curious what he‚Äôll tell you next if you blow him up for lying to you we won‚Äôt get that info and he‚Äôll know that you and i talk a lot,1,,2,italy,england,1,92,Winter,1904
in terms of what i am telling austria i am definitely close with him and i want him to feel like i‚Äôm not going to stab him but we‚Äôre almost to the mid game and cross board alliances work a lot better than neighbor alliances once we get to the midgame so i think you can be confident that you‚Äôre the longterm ally i want,1,,2,italy,england,1,93,Winter,1904
that said i‚Äôm definitely saying nice things to austria too i won‚Äôt deny that not the same nice things but i can‚Äôt have austria thinking i will attack him that doesn‚Äôt help me and i don‚Äôt think it helps you,1,,2,italy,england,1,94,Winter,1904
all of that makes sense i wont call out austria how do you plan to continue your attack on france this year,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,95,Spring,1905
i don‚Äôt know is there something you‚Äôd like me to do i‚Äôm rather flexible i‚Äôd just really like to bust through for a build this year,1,True,2,italy,england,1,96,Spring,1905
thoughts,1,True,2,italy,england,1,97,Spring,1905
would you like to support me to mao,1,True,2,italy,england,1,98,Spring,1905
wont france just cut in bre,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,99,Spring,1905
id actually like mao next year,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,100,Spring,1905
id like to hear something about your plans before midnight,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,101,Spring,1905
what do you need to know i won‚Äôt move to mao i‚Äôll try for spain or marseilles do you want to know more than that,1,True,2,italy,england,1,102,Spring,1905
have you been talking to france at all,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,103,Spring,1905
nope not a word this phase,1,False,2,italy,england,1,104,Spring,1905
huh i guess france is lying to me then,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,105,Spring,1905
yes i haven‚Äôt said a word to him what‚Äôs he saying,1,True,2,italy,england,1,106,Spring,1905
france is a snake,1,True,2,italy,england,1,107,Spring,1905
umm that youre the highest ranked online player in the world and that you consistently encouraged him to attack me,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,108,Spring,1905
well that‚Äôs fun um where to begin   i think i‚Äôm a good online player i‚Äôve been playing online for about two years i have a site ranking on one website in the top 100 and i have a site ranking on another website in the top 250 so maybe if you combine those rankings and squint i‚Äôd be in the top 200 or so,0,True,2,italy,england,1,109,Spring,1905
also i don‚Äôt know who france is so he either has me confused with someone or else he‚Äôs just trying to scare you let‚Äôs seewhy would he be trying to scare you,0,True,2,italy,england,1,110,Spring,1905
and i have definitely encouraged him to attack you as i recall but it‚Äôs been several game years since then i feel like you‚Äôve probably encouraged france to attack me before a fairly natural thing for england to do,1,True,2,italy,england,1,111,Spring,1905
bottom line france has every reason in the world to try to get us to distrust each other and he‚Äôs obviously willing to say whatever to make that happen,1,True,2,italy,england,1,112,Spring,1905
i think i‚Äôve been really honest with you and i think we‚Äôve been helpful to each other and i think we are both going to succeed in this game if we can stick together and not give in to his tricks,1,True,2,italy,england,1,113,Spring,1905
cause snakes are gunna snake,1,True,2,italy,england,1,114,Spring,1905
üêç üêç üêç üêç üêç,1,True,2,italy,england,1,115,Spring,1905
all of this pretty much lines up with what i expected though it‚Äôs nice to hear from you he says that you‚Äôre ‚Äúredacted‚Äù on playdiplomacycom  so i guess the user name lining up is just a coincidence not that i really care that much btw but it would be interesting if you were secretly a star player,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,116,Spring,1905
i‚Äôve never played on playdiplomacy i play mostly on an app called conspiracy   but don‚Äôt get me wrong i‚Äôm experienced and i‚Äôve had some success i‚Äôm not to be trifled with,0,True,2,italy,england,1,117,Spring,1905
also you should be able to see from my moves and austria‚Äôs that i‚Äôve been telling you the truth,1,True,2,italy,england,1,118,Fall,1905
yeah thats fair france is funny ive gotten maybe 15 messages from france since i ghosted him is it rock paper or scissors against him this season,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,119,Fall,1905
from france i can stop italy this turn by the way its pretty easy since italy let me into marseilles i can support the hold in marseilles and marseilles can support mao to spain sc its impossible to breach ive checked it and i can keep making those orders for years and years you stabbed me in spring 03 it is fall 05 i think that you italy and germany are highly underestimating my ability to survive against your onslaught you sure this is the game you want slowly whittling away at me until i die instead i propose that we let you into the mid atlantic ocean and that you help me defend italy i can send you past the mao into west med where you can start taking dots like tunis or naples we wait until ai crumbles and you have an excellent game where you top the board,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,120,Fall,1905
so i have my interpretation of the message but im curious to hear yours,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,121,Fall,1905
hmmm thanks for sending that i mean obviously the orders he proposes can be defeated by tapping marseilles and supporting into spain he knows we know that he‚Äôs just playing games and trying to throw us off,1,True,2,italy,england,1,122,Fall,1905
yeah maybe its not even worth thinking about its like the sicilian in princess bride,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,123,Fall,1905
exactly,1,True,2,italy,england,1,124,Fall,1905
i‚Äôm just going to flip a coin,1,True,2,italy,england,1,125,Fall,1905
so i guess you wont go for mao then,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,126,Fall,1905
correct,1,True,2,italy,england,1,127,Fall,1905
also theres a couple other points id like to cover while i have you here,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,128,Fall,1905
ok that sounds good im eyeing that for next spring,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,129,Fall,1905
sure,1,True,2,italy,england,1,130,Fall,1905
well im surprised you havent been opinionated at all about my actions in russia,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,131,Fall,1905
hmmm well i do have opinions i just don‚Äôt want to be overbearing,1,True,2,italy,england,1,132,Fall,1905
what are you thinking over there,1,True,2,italy,england,1,133,Fall,1905
the builds are tempting but i dont want to be the one that hands austria the game,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,134,Fall,1905
what are your opinions,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,135,Fall,1905
im going to bed but other things i want to talk about are 1 the antienglish moves from germany 2 what youre doing with the tyr unit,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,136,Fall,1905
responding now,1,True,2,italy,england,1,137,Fall,1905
you are thinking about the right considerations re russiaaustria every build is enticing but you have to consider the cost right now russia is basically using all of his units to help you so i think you might be better off foregoing that build and keeping russia on your side for now,1,True,2,italy,england,1,138,Fall,1905
buti certainly have no horse in that fight,1,True,2,italy,england,1,139,Fall,1905
if you want to attack russia no need to hold back on my account,1,True,2,italy,england,1,140,Fall,1905
i do want you to grow so that you and i are the same size and those russian centers will be key to that but they also aren‚Äôt going anywhere i don‚Äôt think there is any rush personally,1,True,2,italy,england,1,141,Fall,1905
the russian units are doing things you want them to do right now,1,True,2,italy,england,1,142,Fall,1905
re germany i hadn‚Äôt really noticed the antienglish moves she keeps telling me that y‚Äôall are very close,1,True,2,italy,england,1,143,Fall,1905
i feel pretty confident that she‚Äôs with you and that she really wants to see france out of the game,1,True,2,italy,england,1,144,Fall,1905
re tyrolia what would you like me to do i do have a plan with that unit and if you wanted to deal a blow to austria i can think of at least one devious plan to make his turn go poorly,1,True,2,italy,england,1,145,Fall,1905
all that makes sense and i believe it i feel like your horse in the russian front is austrias future strength which could pose a threat to you your advice to me is consistent with that,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,146,Fall,1905
yeah that‚Äôs true i just don‚Äôt want to be too nosy or high maintenance really,1,True,2,italy,england,1,147,Fall,1905
i could see you feeling like you need to get some builds promptly and so you pick off a russian unit or two even though that may make my situation tougher i feel like your cooperation against france and later germany means too much to me for me to try to dictate what you do with russia,1,True,2,italy,england,1,148,Fall,1905
i hope that makes sense,1,True,2,italy,england,1,149,Fall,1905
but my advice about what you should do really is my opinion about the best way to approach it from your perspective i don‚Äôt think you need to be in a hurry there i think that just about every place on the board is moving in a positive direction for you right now and so if i were you i would not want to shake that up,1,True,2,italy,england,1,150,Fall,1905
but if you do want to do that it‚Äôs very much okay with me,1,True,2,italy,england,1,151,Fall,1905
yeah im not going for russia right now supposing he can hold the stalemate hes literally just saving those territories for me to take at a later date i will get a little annoyed if the admin cuts us off at 1910 though as i think my endgame is a little past that,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,152,Fall,1905
the antienglish moves arent strictly antienglish but a fleet build in berlin and then moving to kie is a little aggressive  germany hoped i would just give up denmark this fall and that was her explanation of the kie move eventually that kie fleet will be going against me a stab right now from germany doesnt seem to make much sense though,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,153,Fall,1905
it would have to be coordinated with france to even have a chance and with the pressure youre putting in the south i dont know how france could afford that unless hes really pissed at me and goes for a kamikaze just to annoy me,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,154,Fall,1905
and what devious thing could you do with tyr that wouldnt immediately begin aggressions with austria,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,155,Fall,1905
ok now im really going to bed but i can think of a tyr move that would really stir up some trouble i wonder if were thinking of the same one,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,156,Fall,1905
any chance you are around this morning,1,True,2,italy,england,1,157,Fall,1905
what‚Äôs up,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,158,Fall,1905
i don‚Äôt want to tell russia a way to deal austria a blow because russia will turn around and tell austria but i trust you so i think i could pass on some info to you and you might not use it against me,1,True,2,italy,england,1,159,Fall,1905
gotcha what are the moves you‚Äôre thinking,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,160,Fall,1905
you might say something like this to russia  i was chatting with italy about tyrolia and he told me that he promised to use tyrolia to help austria my best guess is that tyrolia and galicia will bounce in vienna if you just use bohemia to support tyrolia in then austria doesn‚Äôt get a build and you likely break up italy and austria,1,True,2,italy,england,1,161,Fall,1905
too devious ü§≠ü§´,1,True,2,italy,england,1,162,Fall,1905
id considered this move as something that russia could do to free up gal but i think i thought ser was a home center or something so i didnt realize the build consequence,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,163,Fall,1905
id bet russia is already planning to do this but i can make the suggestion,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,164,Fall,1905
i did have a different move for tyr in mind,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,165,Fall,1905
oh yeah,1,True,2,italy,england,1,166,Fall,1905
this is not a good idea i should clarify but it would be very dramatic if you successfully supported boh to mun,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,167,Fall,1905
also i have a feeling russia wont be online before noon unfortunately,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,168,Fall,1905
well russia had the right idea but didnt choose the right one to support bounce in ank planned and congrats on mar,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,169,Fall,1905
yes both bounces planned russia made a nice gamble taking bulgaria,1,True,2,italy,england,1,170,Fall,1905
even with austria in bla now ill be a little annoyed if i see a build in st p,1,True,-2,england,italy,1,171,Fall,1905
yeah for sure austria loses that build and keeps vienna vacant russia gets a build yeah i think that worked well for russia,1,True,2,italy,england,1,172,Fall,1905
we should start talking about the france endgame and what things look like postwar maybe after we see the french choice for a disband i think france hates me the most despite me having taken none of his territories and as a result will probably hold onto brest until the end or maybe even go for lvp or something,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,173,Winter,1905
sure ‚Äî i‚Äôm happy to talk it through that move by france to bounce nao was annoying,1,True,3,italy,england,1,174,Winter,1905
yeah i kinda saw that coming so things are kinda escalating with germany she‚Äôs making lots of asks that i don‚Äôt think are reasonable like ‚Äúwhy not just give me denmark‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy not just leave nth open‚Äù she‚Äôs also admitted to being friendly with france,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,175,Spring,1906
yeah i‚Äôm hearing rumblings of the same thing from germany just sort of feeling me out on whether i‚Äôd be okay with her working with france not good,1,True,3,italy,england,1,176,Spring,1906
how would you like to address it with moves this turn do you want me to support you to mao or should i move there,1,True,3,italy,england,1,177,Spring,1906
how has she suggested to you that she‚Äôll be helping france because if she‚Äôs telling you that it must mean working with france against me maybe with something specific in mind she also wants me to give up brest haha maybe i‚Äôll ask if she wants london,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,178,Spring,1906
i don‚Äôt know anything specific she‚Äôs just asking for my thoughts i have not responded,0,True,3,italy,england,1,179,Spring,1906
though i‚Äôm not surprised france is not going to quit he hasn‚Äôt been talking to me anymore and he hasn‚Äôt been trying to turn you that means he‚Äôs been working on germany i think we just have to keep telling her that france is a dark wizard who does not have her best interest in mind,1,True,3,italy,england,1,180,Spring,1906
yeah i mean good on france for being persistent im sure france is telling her that were allies and that would actually be the truth and just geographically it would be hard for me and germany to be allies longerterm so its somewhat understandable that germany could be swayed by that logic,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,181,Spring,1906
what are your thoughts on the timing of war with germany if youre keen on a war in the near future at all i have an idea of how to handle the situation thats slightly dependent on that,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,182,Spring,1906
well i don‚Äôt really want to attack germany this year in a perfect world you and i each get a build this year and we are in position to attack germany next year,1,True,3,italy,england,1,183,Spring,1906
germany seems to like my advice so i may be able to get her to take paris this year and refrain from attacking you if we can cripple france in the next two turns without germany attacking then next year‚Äôs attack on germany would be easy,1,True,3,italy,england,1,184,Spring,1906
that is my general thinking in it,1,True,3,italy,england,1,185,Spring,1906
i mean i dont see how i get a build this year outside of moving in on russia but id rather stay out for now honestly the worst that germany can do this year is knock me out of the channel,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,186,Spring,1906
so i dont want support into mao this turn i might reach out to france with a proposition for survival that i wont follow through with but maybe i can make it convincing enough that he gives it a shot otherwise im rather nervous that france gives germany a big hand with attacking my island in his final years,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,187,Spring,1906
also will an attack on germany really be easy next year,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,188,Spring,1906
also did you tell germany i was plotting against her she says you did,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,189,Spring,1906
whoa ‚Äî no i want you and germany to work together,0,False,3,italy,england,1,190,Spring,1906
i would not and have not said you are plotting against her she floated the ‚Äúwork with france thing‚Äù and i suggested that she should really take paris now while she can,0,False,3,italy,england,1,191,Spring,1906
if we can get germany to take paris next year will be much easier i think we should both direct her there,1,,3,italy,england,1,192,Spring,1906
you really said nothing to that effect what would prompt france to say that to me it‚Äôs ok if you did say something but i want you to be honest about it,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,193,Spring,1906
some exciting moves will be curious to see where you stand,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,194,Spring,1906
hey ‚Äî sorry i‚Äôve been offline since the bot went down that looks like a pretty aggressive move from germany i wonder if france has pocketed her i do like the move to paris but the rest is not good,1,True,3,italy,england,1,195,Spring,1906
yeahh it‚Äôs a shame i mean i‚Äôm aware at this point that the two of you could choose to mow over me i hope the expanse in northern russia makes you wary of helping germany though,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,196,Spring,1906
time for survival mode will appreciate some advice on tactics if you‚Äôre on my side of this,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,197,Spring,1906
yeah i‚Äôm on your side i‚Äôll help on tactics but i think the real key here is getting germany to flip back i don‚Äôt see why that move has to be permanent i think you should tell her something like this ‚Äúlook i see that you are attacking you but i think it‚Äôs my fault not yours i should have given you back denmark i see that now and i‚Äôm sorry i will move out peaceably and i hope we can work out a new working relationship‚Äù,1,True,3,italy,england,1,198,Spring,1906
just say you‚Äôre sorry she can take it back anyway might as well offer it back right,1,True,3,italy,england,1,199,Spring,1906
and i‚Äôm not saying you have anything to be sorry for i‚Äôm just trying to brainstorm about what will help you turn her back to your side,1,True,3,italy,england,1,200,Spring,1906
i already responded nonangrily though not specifically what you said i think a return of denmark could go a long way though that border will make things tense and i don‚Äôt think peace with her could last forever,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,201,Spring,1906
one thing im curious about why would you want germany and i to be friends arent you better off with both of us fighting and i can keep denmark this fall if i give up the channel which may fall anyways,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,202,Spring,1906
well i want to be rid of france i‚Äôve really been depending on the two of you to help in that project if england decides to move out of paris for france that‚Äôs bad for me   also i don‚Äôt want to see germany get two builds this turn but you‚Äôre right if it‚Äôs inevitable anyway it‚Äôs not the end of the world   teamengland,0,True,3,italy,england,1,203,Spring,1906
i sure hope you‚Äôve not been clicking that thumbs down haha it would be a brutal stab i suppose i‚Äôve got to place my trust somewhere though why choose me instead of germany,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,204,Spring,1906
you know if youre able to lend a hand from mao im actually not in that bad of shape can i depend on that,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,205,Fall,1906
1 you‚Äôve been straight with me all game 2 you have a much better ability to read the board than she does 3 you‚Äôre on the other side so you can‚Äôt really stab me but i could totally see her moving to tyrolia some time soon 4 you‚Äôre not in france‚Äôs pocket,0,True,3,italy,england,1,206,Fall,1906
all good reasons also i think germany is gonna ghost me soooo friends i need mao to attack bre can you do that,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,207,Fall,1906
i will ensure that brest can‚Äôt hurt you not sure yet if i‚Äôll cut that support or get france to do something weird with it but you can consider that unit non functional this turn i‚Äôll also see what intel i can gain,1,True,3,italy,england,1,208,Fall,1906
cool you really think you can get france to take your advice on brest,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,209,Fall,1906
and do you have opinions about russia walking into mun,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,210,Fall,1906
re brest if i‚Äôm not confident i‚Äôll just cut that support i know that one is important to you and i‚Äôll make sure it‚Äôs taken care of,1,True,3,italy,england,1,211,Fall,1906
re munich that one never really crossed my mind but if you can get russia to do that it would be awesome i don‚Äôt want to see germany get builds here,1,True,3,italy,england,1,212,Fall,1906
cool any advice on the rest of tactics for my defense i have my own ideas but would be curious to hear your opinion,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,213,Fall,1906
i‚Äôd probably just use the army to protect liverpool i‚Äôd send nao to norwegian if the battle is going to be against germany and i‚Äôd flip a coin between supporting channel to belgium or supporting denmark holding,1,True,3,italy,england,1,214,Fall,1906
and i wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone the result of that coin flip there is just no reason to share that info,1,True,3,italy,england,1,215,Fall,1906
huh thats way different than what i had in mind,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,216,Fall,1906
well you‚Äôre closer to it than i am i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve taken a much harder look what am i missing,1,True,3,italy,england,1,217,Fall,1906
youre not missing anything but i had a more defensive strategy in mind i guess ive got some time to think it over please do let me know what intel you receive,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,218,Fall,1906
hi i have a different ask of the mao unit actually if youre around this morning,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,219,Fall,1906
hey ‚Äî what‚Äôs up,1,True,3,italy,england,1,220,Fall,1906
i want to see whether supporting channel to bre is an option for mao youd consider and id also want to know if gas support will be cut,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,221,Fall,1906
well have to just be honest here ‚Äî i‚Äôve been working on a larger plan considering your earlier request that i neutralize brest and i‚Äôm not sure that change works in the larger scheme,1,True,3,italy,england,1,222,Fall,1906
more broadly is there any chance you‚Äôd like to form a trio and work with me and russia long term,0,True,3,italy,england,1,223,Fall,1906
why wouldnt you let me in on your larger plan,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,224,Fall,1906
and does your larger plan include neutralizing brest or did it just consider that i asked that can you confirm youre neutralizing brest by attacking it from mao,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,225,Fall,1906
yes hitting brest   i prefer not to share my moves if they don‚Äôt matter to someone else there is just less chance that something goes wrong and less chance i end up blaming someone else if something goes wrong,1,True,3,italy,england,1,226,Fall,1906
what do you think about eir as a trio,0,True,3,italy,england,1,227,Fall,1906
i think you need to justify to me why supporting into brest isnt an option i dont see how this could be relevant to some larger plan unless the plan is dont give england that build dont show others that im supporting england,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,228,Fall,1906
wow well you asked me to do something else earlier and i have spent days trying to fit your earlier request into my move set,1,True,3,italy,england,1,229,Fall,1906
but you know what it‚Äôs more important to me to have you as an ally so i‚Äôll support you to brest,1,True,3,italy,england,1,230,Fall,1906
i obviously would like that but to be honest i care less about the support and more about the secret,1,,-3,england,italy,1,231,Fall,1906
so confirmed mao supporting channel to brest,1,True,3,italy,england,1,232,Fall,1906
test,0,True,3,italy,england,1,233,Fall,1906
it‚Äôs not a secret it‚Äôs just that i like to keep my moves secret unless they matter to someone,0,True,3,italy,england,1,234,Fall,1906
can you confirm whether support from gas is cut as well,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,235,Fall,1906
i am not currently cutting support in gascony,1,True,3,italy,england,1,236,Fall,1906
ok and im down to chat about russian relations after the move sorry for the lastminute change here but germanys been putting pressure on me,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,237,Fall,1906
have to say ‚Äî i expect germany to use paris to support brest those two seem to be in lockstep now,1,True,3,italy,england,1,238,Fall,1906
are you sure that i should just take portugal to drop england down to 1 unit,1,True,3,italy,england,1,239,Fall,1906
i mean drop france down to 1 unit,1,True,3,italy,england,1,240,Fall,1906
france is just going to bounce you out right what else does it make sense for the spa unit to do,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,241,Fall,1906
he thinks i am supporting an attack on spain and moving to burgundy so i think his moves look like this  spain hold gas s spa holding paris s brest brest s mao  channel he asked me to take it irish  liv,1,True,3,italy,england,1,242,Fall,1906
hmm yeah i would have thought he would assume the gas support would be cut does france really hate you the least,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,243,Fall,1906
yeah i think france trusts that i‚Äôm actually going to channel and burgundy here,1,True,3,italy,england,1,244,Fall,1906
i will admit ive communicated with germany about your plan to use mao to help me that may have made its way back to france,1,,-3,england,italy,1,245,Fall,1906
i feel like you germany and france if i tell anyone anything it circulates to all three,1,True,3,italy,england,1,246,Fall,1906
yeahh i maybe should keep my mouth shut more often,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,247,Fall,1906
germany says that the brest thing relates to denmark   anyway what should we do,1,True,3,italy,england,1,248,Fall,1906
it does im giving up denmark for support to brest,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,249,Fall,1906
okay i‚Äôll support you to brest,1,True,3,italy,england,1,250,Fall,1906
sounds great,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,251,Fall,1906
thanks,1,True,-3,england,italy,1,252,Fall,1906
glad to see that go through,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,253,Winter,1906
told you about the move to por btw,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,254,Winter,1906
you were right thank you,1,True,5,italy,england,1,255,Winter,1906
well im glad to see the takedown work out i suppose france has one more unit but por will fall next year and now things get even more interesting signing off for now,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,256,Winter,1906
hmmm interesting french disband he wants me to support him to brest have to believe he‚Äôs going to have germany on his side given the german fleet build   thoughts on how to approach this we should be able to defeat them if we stick together,0,True,5,italy,england,1,257,Spring,1907
i think we should focus on getting your army to pic this turn and i can support you to paris in the fall,0,True,5,italy,england,1,258,Spring,1907
do not discuss plans with germany this turn seems very clear that she‚Äôs coming for you based on the build and the french disband i don‚Äôt think we help ourselves by speaking with her let‚Äôs just get you into paris secure north sea and get moving,0,True,5,italy,england,1,259,Spring,1907
i don‚Äôt need any builds in the north if i get bigger i‚Äôll have a target on my back so i‚Äôm just going to help you get up to my level,0,True,5,italy,england,1,260,Spring,1907
also i need to decide to work with russia or austria in the east what‚Äôs your preference,0,True,5,italy,england,1,261,Spring,1907
ill be in communication with germany but ill agree to not share any specific plans discussed between the two of us this turn is that fair,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,262,Spring,1907
yes of course i don‚Äôt mean that you shouldn‚Äôt talk to her at all,1,True,5,italy,england,1,263,Spring,1907
at first glance i prefer an alliance with russia though i understand this means you breaking a relationship with austria mostly this is because russia can threaten me if he ever goes north whats your preference,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,264,Spring,1907
well that‚Äôs fine with me i like russia but here is the downside for you if russia grows the north won‚Äôt be undefended any more and you will have less room to grow so think long term and think about where your dots are going to come from i mean it sincerely when i say that i‚Äôll join up with either one provided you feel good about it but i actually think it might be better for you if i give back austria a couple of centers and position you to grab swe and stp once germany is on her heels,0,True,5,italy,england,1,265,Spring,1907
those are good points i suppose youd like to commit to this before moves this evening,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,266,Spring,1907
commit one way or the other,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,267,Spring,1907
yeah i think we should make a plan,1,True,5,italy,england,1,268,Spring,1907
i‚Äôd like to have your final thoughts on ar as quickly as possible so that i have time to execute a plan but i understand if you want time to think about it,1,True,5,italy,england,1,269,Spring,1907
how is germany treating you right now did she tell you about that fleet build before it happened seems like a bad sign and north sea is awfully exposed,1,True,5,italy,england,1,270,Spring,1907
oh she told me that she plans to line the whole northwest coast with fleets because theyre more versatile there but all they can do from the northwest coast is invade me,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,271,Spring,1907
she also said she wants brest eventually,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,272,Spring,1907
not sure if i can keep nth this year well see if i can keep it friendly that involves lots of talk about moving against you she wants to see me in mao,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,273,Spring,1907
yeah look i don‚Äôt mind if you tell her that you‚Äôre moving against me i am telling her that i‚Äôm moving against you   let‚Äôs please make the following deal you and i both plot with germany as if we‚Äôre attacking each other and we both share the plan with germany against the other guy with each other and we pledge to tell germany and france if he asks that you and i are not talking much we don‚Äôt trust each other and we don‚Äôt have any plan in place,1,True,5,italy,england,1,274,Spring,1907
this turn will work best if we share all info that we learn from gf and we pledge to keep our own talks secret,1,True,5,italy,england,1,275,Spring,1907
i think that we can pull off a great turn but it won‚Äôt work if gf get catch wind of our alliance,0,True,5,italy,england,1,276,Spring,1907
all that makes sense im on board you know if germany just stopped surprising me with aggressive moves she may have won my favor sigh,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,277,Spring,1907
and i think austria is the ally we choose if we hold off germany she can only expand into russia which would be her only friend and the trusting relationship you have makes it more likely that things will go through,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,278,Spring,1907
üëå,0,True,5,italy,england,1,279,Spring,1907
so here is the plan that germany is telling me  she wants to ensure she gets north sea so she is asking for this  den s bel  north bel  north hol  bel pic  channel spa  gas par s sap  gas mao  irish,0,True,5,italy,england,1,280,Spring,1907
she wanted me to support her direct from paris to brest but i convinced her that you would likely fear a forced disband so you were likely to try to keep me out of gascony thus par s spa  gas,0,True,5,italy,england,1,281,Spring,1907
i don‚Äôt think we can save north sea this turn but if we can land your army in pic we can force france to retreat to belgium which would be absolutely awesome and i think his survival instinct would kick in at that point and he would stay there until you take it,0,True,5,italy,england,1,282,Spring,1907
i may be able to save nth with some diplomacy is it worth me trying to make germany a hard case to be on my side does that just make her moves less predictable,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,283,Spring,1907
so i would suggest this bre s wal  pic wal  pic channel convoy wal  pic  that means germany will lose paris and belgium this year and i think you can defend your territory even with g in north sea,0,True,5,italy,england,1,284,Spring,1907
i really think that we are best off not suggesting that you and i are talking if germany gets any idea that i shared her plans with you we‚Äôll have no idea what they are going to do,0,True,5,italy,england,1,285,Spring,1907
uhh germany will just hop into one of my home centers from nth in the fall,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,286,Spring,1907
i trust you at this point but i don‚Äôt think that confronting her is the best move here,0,True,5,italy,england,1,287,Spring,1907
no you can defend,1,True,5,italy,england,1,288,Spring,1907
oh move  to cly,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,289,Spring,1907
oh wait nth just  retreats whoops,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,290,Spring,1907
you can move nao to norwegian in spring and retreat north to norway then in fall you cover london with channel while i support you to paris,0,True,5,italy,england,1,291,Spring,1907
right,1,True,5,italy,england,1,292,Spring,1907
so you have coverage for every center and you get the build while g loses two,0,True,5,italy,england,1,293,Spring,1907
thoughts on a retreat to hel,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,294,Spring,1907
that‚Äôs the best i can come up with if g is being honest with me,0,True,5,italy,england,1,295,Spring,1907
i would not be opposed to a retreat to hel but  it depends a lot on what the board looks like i‚Äôm not crazy about germany taking norway we want her taking units off the board,0,True,5,italy,england,1,296,Spring,1907
well ill at least communicate with germany to the point that she thinks im genuinely against you but i wont ask for any favors,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,297,Spring,1907
if i do ill let you know and we should expect that you hear about them,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,298,Spring,1907
agreed yes i‚Äôm totally fine with that we want g thinking that we‚Äôre working against each other,1,True,5,italy,england,1,299,Spring,1907
and frankly she‚Äôs going to be pissed at me after this move so i wouldn‚Äôt mind if you lied to her too at the same time to spread that out a bit,0,True,5,italy,england,1,300,Spring,1907
so plot away against me but tell me what plan you guys work out so we can talk about what she‚Äôs most likely to do,0,True,5,italy,england,1,301,Spring,1907
france wants me to go for mao im going to say im on board with that ill say nao is going there,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,302,Spring,1907
i mean germany,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,303,Spring,1907
yep that makes sense she wants edi and norway clear,1,True,5,italy,england,1,304,Spring,1907
also does it matter so much if germany is mad at both of us isnt it basically war in the fall,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,305,Spring,1907
if i were you i‚Äôd order nao to norwegian from norwegian you have a play to defend norway and edi which means you could retreat to helg if you like and you have a 5050 to defend norway or edi,0,True,5,italy,england,1,306,Spring,1907
yeah thats what ill order,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,307,Spring,1907
re g being mad it‚Äôs not the end of the world i mean we‚Äôll definitely be at war with her i just don‚Äôt want her trying to throw the game in spite or anything like that cause i am lying to her like crazy this turn ü§≠ü§´,0,True,5,italy,england,1,308,Spring,1907
yeahh it happens ive been fortunate to not really have to lie so far,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,309,Spring,1907
what are your thoughts on mun,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,310,Spring,1907
also just out of curiosity did you advise germany to build the kiel fleet,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,311,Spring,1907
i absolutely did not advise g to build the f kie,1,True,5,italy,england,1,312,Spring,1907
we did not talk at all about that build,1,True,5,italy,england,1,313,Spring,1907
thoughts on mun what do you mean,1,True,5,italy,england,1,314,Spring,1907
if g would have asked i would have said that two armies would make me a bit uncomfortable but i would not have insisted on a fleet as two armies would have been more antirussian than anything but she did not ask me,1,True,5,italy,england,1,315,Spring,1907
i believe you i just was curious and i didnt look closely enough at mun ber can just support but i thought it might be interesting to work with russia there even if russia isnt the longterm ally,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,316,Spring,1907
also who does germany think the third ally is,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,317,Spring,1907
i ask because we may be interested to know whether germany will try to sneak into swe or not,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,318,Spring,1907
well i‚Äôm not next to munich now so there isn‚Äôt much i can do about that maybe in the fall,0,True,5,italy,england,1,319,Spring,1907
germany and i have not discussed a third ally she doesn‚Äôt give the impression that she cares much about the east,1,True,5,italy,england,1,320,Spring,1907
i guess the question in spring is whether you move to tyr and would we want her moving into russia if she goes east and annoys her future only friend on the board this might complicate their future relations,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,321,Spring,1907
well that‚Äôs a great idea i am all for her moving on russia if you can accomplish that i‚Äôm certainly willing to go to tyrolia,1,True,5,italy,england,1,322,Spring,1907
alright ill plant the seed about antirussia stuff if she thinks youre a friend though she may listen to you more than me,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,323,Spring,1907
fyi she just asked me if i am talking with you i told her ‚Äúi am wary of england right now he just asked me what i want to do this turn i feel like he‚Äôs trying to get me to leave mao open‚Äù,1,True,5,italy,england,1,324,Spring,1907
cool consistent with my messaging im talking about a plan to leave bre open and get her support to gas so i can support into spa im asking for her to promise bre to france and then bounce in bre instead,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,325,Spring,1907
then id dislodge in mao and youd retreat to iri well see what she thinks i imagine shes just playing along but i need to make specific plans to be believable,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,326,Spring,1907
üíØ,1,True,5,italy,england,1,327,Spring,1907
looks like germany is staying friendly with russia can we go over moves one more time so i can be sure we‚Äôre on the same page,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,328,Spring,1907
here is what i have down right now mao s brest wes s mao lyo  tyr s spa  gas pie  mar ven  tyr nap  ion,0,True,5,italy,england,1,329,Spring,1907
cool all expected right now im nao to nwg nth hold wal to pic channel convoy wal to pic bre support wal to pic,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,330,Spring,1907
i like it   as i think about it more you may be better off moving north to holland expecting a bounce there i think you‚Äôre slightly better off keeping the german fleet in kiel as it‚Äôs one less german unit in north sea but it‚Äôs not a huge difference either way,0,True,5,italy,england,1,331,Spring,1907
thats good advice ill take it,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,332,Spring,1907
i‚Äôm kind of excited about this turn,1,True,5,italy,england,1,333,Spring,1907
a stab is always exciting,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,334,Spring,1907
i‚Äôm sorry mate you‚Äôve been a terrific ally first class all the way but on this turn germany made the kind of offer i could not refuse and so i went for it,0,True,5,italy,england,1,335,Spring,1907
i know that doesn‚Äôt make it any easier but i really mean it when i say that you‚Äôve played a strong game and been an excellent ally,1,True,5,italy,england,1,336,Spring,1907
no worries nicely played on your end i think i can top germany‚Äôs offer if you‚Äôre interested let me know,1,False,-5,england,italy,1,337,Spring,1907
hmmmmi‚Äôm intrigued aren‚Äôt you supposed to be screaming obscenities at me right nowthis response is downright classy and sportsmanlike,1,True,5,italy,england,1,338,Spring,1907
haha yeah i suppose but this game for me is about learning i‚Äôm relatively new to the game and i volunteered for the study 1 to help out my friend and 2 to prep for an inperson game i have on august 11 so if i get the right experience from this game and do well in the inperson game ie win bragging rights among my friends i‚Äôve won my game here is my offer you bring me along to second place i vow to help you solo as italy and you teach me how you pulled it off what do you say,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,339,Spring,1907
well that is a better offer than germany‚Äôs one of the best offers i‚Äôve ever received and i really mean it when i say that you‚Äôre a joy to play with and a strong ally i‚Äôd be happy to teach you as much as i can,1,True,5,italy,england,1,340,Spring,1907
i suggest you retreat to skagerrak to put maximum pressure on germany,1,True,5,italy,england,1,341,Spring,1907
well i‚Äôm happy to learn if you‚Äôre willing to teach do we have a deal then this is obviously something you‚Äôll have to trust me with but i haven‚Äôt lied tp you yet and don‚Äôt intend to and i imagine you can tactically keep me in a position where i‚Äôm not a threat also on the teaching side of things i may have some questions about earlier in the game to learn how you set things up and i would expect genuine answers,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,342,Spring,1907
and yeah that retreat makes sense you think norway and the home island are too defensive,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,343,Spring,1907
i‚Äôll answer anything you ask honestly,1,True,5,italy,england,1,344,Spring,1907
you have more options from skag and she can‚Äôt cover them all you have a much higher upside from there and it might be worth it for you to take sweden to avoid having to disband,1,True,5,italy,england,1,345,Spring,1907
regarding your offer it may be hard to put you in second place frankly if your units are doing things that help me then i‚Äôll try to keep your units on the board and i definitely won‚Äôt allow you to be eliminated but it‚Äôs really hard for me to ensure that you place second,1,True,5,italy,england,1,346,Spring,1907
i can settle for survival deal,0,True,-5,england,italy,1,347,Spring,1907
your reasoning on skag makes sense going to bed now first question on strategy is how frequently dp you tell lies and what are the typical circumstances,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,348,Spring,1907
hmmm well you know we‚Äôll have statistics to help answer that question at the end of the game i‚Äôd say that i am mostly honest and i place a lot of value on my credibility i‚Äôm not going to lie about my moves to someone unless i am going to get a huge advantage out of it but i spend most of the game trying to make everyone else on the board feel that i‚Äôm their closest ally so a lot of what i say is a shade on the truth,1,True,5,italy,england,1,349,Spring,1907
so i found it hard to decide whether to use a thumbs up or thumbs down quite a lot most of the time there is some truth in what i‚Äôm saying but i am trying to persuade the other player to do something for reasons i am not telling them,1,True,5,italy,england,1,350,Spring,1907
so in general i‚Äôm not afraid to lie but i am very afraid of getting caught lying i try to preserve my credibility as best i can but if i am setting up a stab i will tell some serious whoppers,1,True,5,italy,england,1,351,Spring,1907
also that thing france said about my past successes that was true i do have a lot of experience and i have had a fair amount of success playing online diplomacy i just did not want you thinking of me that way,1,True,5,italy,england,1,352,Spring,1907
i‚Äôll also note just cause i have nobody else to talk with about this i worked really hard on this last move germany wanted to take brest but if that happened it would have cut support and prevented your army from leaving your island so i had to convince germany to support france to brest without telling her the real reason why and i needed you to go to nao so that you could not guard liverpool there were so many liesü§ûüò±,1,True,5,italy,england,1,353,Spring,1907
and that doesn‚Äôt even include the east,1,True,5,italy,england,1,354,Spring,1907
to be completely honest i directed just about everyone else‚Äôs moves on that turn russia is the one exception but i basically knew what he was going to do the best advice i have for someone who wants to get better at diplomacy just work hard you can win by putting in more time and effort than everyone else i have success by writing a lot to everyone all the time,1,True,5,italy,england,1,355,Spring,1907
yeah that‚Äôs one thing about online diplomacy i have mixed feelings about it seems like there‚Äôs definitely a benefit from putting a lot of time in i feel like i‚Äôve been putting a lot of time in as it is but there‚Äôs been the temptation to put in more for inperson everybody gets the same amount of time to chat which can be an equalizer in some ways,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,356,Spring,1907
i had considered what a stab from you might look like before it happened and i was like ‚Äúis he really going to all that trouble‚Äù but i suppose you were care to share why you chose germany and how early you made that choice what was the ‚Äúoffer‚Äù,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,357,Spring,1907
and that‚Äôs cool that i‚Äôm playing with a champ,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,358,Spring,1907
hi england ‚Äî so i see that you retreated to norway not what i expected but it can work would you still like to work with me,1,True,5,italy,england,1,359,Fall,1907
yeah i know we didn‚Äôt chat about this it was a little last minute and you hadn‚Äôt responded in the morning so i didn‚Äôt think you were around also i thought ska was more a suggestion i should have given you a heads up my thinking was 1 it‚Äôs going to sweden anyways 2 i thought it might help warm relations with germany was this a bad call,1,False,-5,england,italy,1,360,Fall,1907
i would still like to work with you,0,True,-5,england,italy,1,361,Fall,1907
not a big deal at all,1,True,5,italy,england,1,362,Fall,1907
i suggest that you take sweden and i‚Äôm working on getting belgium this turn too it‚Äôll be tricky to keep germany from defending it but i‚Äôm going to try,1,True,5,italy,england,1,363,Fall,1907
pic to bel,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,364,Fall,1907
and you were a bit shy about the earlier learning question i guess it may be something sensitive to give an honest answer to at this time one other question i have is whether theres a mistake youve seen in my play that you think i could have done differently like choosing to coldshoulder france or choosing not to sneak into sweden earlier,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,365,Fall,1907
also france is asking about our relations after the stab what would you like me to say,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,366,Fall,1907
something about how awful i am and how much you want revengeü§≠,1,True,5,italy,england,1,367,Fall,1907
haha alright i‚Äôll keep you ‚Äúabrest‚Äù of how france will move that fleet should he choose to share,0,,-5,england,italy,1,368,Fall,1907
okay i think we have a good move brewing,1,True,5,italy,england,1,369,Fall,1907
if you‚Äôre sincerely on board this will be fun,1,True,5,italy,england,1,370,Fall,1907
france is ordering brest to channel  germany is ordering burg s bel and convoying holland to yorkshire,1,True,5,italy,england,1,371,Fall,1907
so here is the move norway  swe pic s channel  belgium mar  bur to cut support gas to bre to block the paris move   i think you‚Äôre going to get a build this turn even if i take liverpool   does that make sense,0,True,5,italy,england,1,372,Fall,1907
yeah im on board though i will remind you that youre forgetting an important part of the bargain so i guess nwg to edi which is probably safe in case she goes for the build instead and then plan to build in london,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,373,Fall,1907
what part of the bargain am i forgetting it‚Äôs unintentional i‚Äôm trying to be helpful,1,True,5,italy,england,1,374,Fall,1907
you overlooked a couple of my questions,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,375,Fall,1907
im sure youve been busy setting up that move so its no big deal just wanted to remind you,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,376,Fall,1907
sorry,1,True,5,italy,england,1,377,Fall,1907
you asked a question about what germany offered me do you mind if i answer that after this move i‚Äôd just like to see for sure that you‚Äôre sincere in working with me after i so rudely stabbed you,1,True,5,italy,england,1,378,Fall,1907
yeah that ones fair to skip for now i think,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,379,Fall,1907
germany is now fishing for info from me about our relationship does she know that we are still talking i‚Äôd like to tell her that you‚Äôre mad at me and you will tell me nothing but we must keep our stories straight,1,True,5,italy,england,1,380,Fall,1907
no but id bet shed assume it we didnt have much to say to each other this morning i tried to be friendly but she was kinda straight up about saying that an alliance wasnt going to work out and i sent a message back but havent heard anything so id imagine shed think im not just sitting here twiddling my thumbs up to you how to spin it though,0,True,-5,england,italy,1,381,Fall,1907
thank you üëå,1,True,5,italy,england,1,382,Fall,1907
im going to be hit or miss with connectivity this evening so im putting moves in now will look just before the adjudication though but im trying to get some work done so right now im eng to bel pic support eng to bel nwy to swe and nwg to edi,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,383,Fall,1907
üëç,1,True,5,italy,england,1,384,Fall,1907
i‚Äôll let you know if anything changes on my end,1,True,5,italy,england,1,385,Fall,1907
cool sounds good,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,386,Fall,1907
hmmm germany is backing off the bait i think we will have to change our plan,1,True,5,italy,england,1,387,Fall,1907
whats up,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,388,Fall,1907
not sure yet but she is not going to leave belgium unguarded so that won‚Äôt work,1,True,5,italy,england,1,389,Fall,1907
alright keep me posted,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,390,Fall,1907
she is pressing hard now for info from me on your moves i am telling her that you are jovial with me but that we have not discussed any substance,1,True,5,italy,england,1,391,Fall,1907
üëç,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,392,Fall,1907
france is offering to move in a way that would help against you does it matter what i say,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,393,Fall,1907
i don‚Äôt think it matters i believe he is lying to you,1,True,5,italy,england,1,394,Fall,1907
okay cause you had said he‚Äôd be going to the channel before is that still true and any update on belgium,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,395,Fall,1907
working on it i‚Äôll have an update in an hour,1,True,5,italy,england,1,396,Fall,1907
ok i‚Äôll be asleep probably but i‚Äôll see in the morning,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,397,Fall,1907
so it sounds to me like germany thinks you are coming for her and she will not leave belgium unguarded   i think your best bet will be the following picardy  brest expect a bounce channel  london expect that the french fleet will move to the channel which will mean you don‚Äôt lose brest  norwegian to edi just in case norway to sweden  i was hoping for a better move involving taking belgium but i just don‚Äôt think i can swing it   thoughts what are you hearing now from france and germany,1,,5,italy,england,1,398,Fall,1907
long one from germany talking up your evils talking collaboration with france suggested moves are nwg to cly holland to york eng goes to iri or wales belgium supports brest to channel pic to bre par to pic bur to par mun to bur,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,399,Fall,1907
haven‚Äôt responded yet will have a somewhat busy morning so i‚Äôll appreciate your guidance if you think this changes anything,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,400,Fall,1907
thank you just woke up thinking about this any ideas,1,True,5,italy,england,1,401,Fall,1907
seems like she‚Äôs going to try to take brest for herself,1,True,5,italy,england,1,402,Fall,1907
i think you tell her ‚Äúyes‚Äù but then order pic to bre and channel to london that way france moves out of brest and you bounce germany in brest and keep it,1,True,5,italy,england,1,403,Fall,1907
and i‚Äôd stick with nwg to edi and norway to sweden,1,True,5,italy,england,1,404,Fall,1907
and by the way thank you very much for filling me in makes me feel really confident that you‚Äôre with me,1,True,5,italy,england,1,405,Fall,1907
yeah happy to help just got online now let me take a moment to process all of this,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,406,Fall,1907
okfirst question youre saying shes going for bre on her own but shes suggesting pic to bre maybe shes hoping for you to support paris in,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,407,Fall,1907
hmmm no she does not expect my support but i‚Äôm surprised she‚Äôs screwing over france,1,True,5,italy,england,1,408,Fall,1907
well do you think shes being honest with me,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,409,Fall,1907
it‚Äôs really hard for me to say i know she is eager for her own builds so my best guess is that she‚Äôs being partially honest with you and that she is going to grab london or edi if she feels confident you are not going to cover,1,True,5,italy,england,1,410,Fall,1907
yeah the suggestion of going to cly is consistent with that and that the channel moves away from london,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,411,Fall,1907
i think your suggestion makes sense covering edi and london is safe and germany seems a bit unpredictable and i keep fingers crossed that france indeed will vacate brest,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,412,Fall,1907
and since you havent been specific on your plan for lvp i can only assume that youll be moving there,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,413,Fall,1907
i am planning to move to liverpool i‚Äôm sorry that costs you a unit but the way this is going it may very well be the last center i take from you and i think it‚Äôs much more likely now that you take second place,1,True,5,italy,england,1,414,Fall,1907
ok gotcha hmm i just realized that i really have to hope for a bounce in edi or london because if i get bre and swe i would get a build even with you in lvp but then i wouldnt have an open home supply center to build at,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,415,Fall,1907
well you‚Äôre right about that perhaps ask germany to bounce with you in edi,1,True,5,italy,england,1,416,Fall,1907
though i don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be getting a build now because you‚Äôre unlikely to get belgium butif you think germany is really convoying to yorkshire i‚Äôm willing to order marseilles to burgundy to cut support while you support channel to belgium,1,True,5,italy,england,1,417,Fall,1907
if i get bre and swe but you get lvp im still net up by one it will be rebuilding the disbanded fleet that was in bre,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,418,Fall,1907
brest is already english,1,True,5,italy,england,1,419,Fall,1907
yeah but i get the unit back is all i mean im down to 4 now,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,420,Fall,1907
i have 5 centers and 4 units now add swe hold bre take away lvp and ive got another unit to put on the board,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,421,Fall,1907
but only if i have a free home supply center,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,422,Fall,1907
ah you‚Äôre totally right my mistake,1,True,5,italy,england,1,423,Fall,1907
this is getting tricky,1,True,5,italy,england,1,424,Fall,1907
haha yeah given your comms with france would it make sense that shes being genuine with me,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,425,Fall,1907
it‚Äôs possible but i just don‚Äôt know,1,True,5,italy,england,1,426,Fall,1907
i‚Äôd be really surprised if she wanted to cut out france at this point,1,True,5,italy,england,1,427,Fall,1907
yeah i think i have to play defensive then i actually think aggression from her is more likely i would be surprised if neither london or edi bounce ill say i agree to her proposal though,1,True,-5,england,italy,1,428,Fall,1907
okay i think that‚Äôs the right move this is the first turn in a while that is fairly unpredictable from my point of view it would be really great if you wind up with a build,1,True,5,italy,england,1,429,Fall,1907
well played,1,False,7,italy,england,1,430,Winter,1907
so do i get ghosted now after you duped me,1,True,7,italy,england,1,431,Winter,1907
if your strategy is not to talk to me again i‚Äôd appreciate if you would at least let me know that as a courtesy just trying to play a board game here,1,True,7,italy,england,1,432,Winter,1907
hey no not going to be a dick i have agreed to not talk to you,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,433,Winter,1907
okay i think that is a bad choice in any game of diplomacy and likely in any game in general and it only helps other people but i‚Äôll respect your choice if that is how you want to play   if you do ever decide you want to talk my door will always be open no matter what and i am willing to keep all communications secret if that‚Äôs the issue,1,True,7,italy,england,1,434,Winter,1907
love is a game and it‚Äôs wise to stay away from your ex if the relationship was toxic,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,435,Winter,1907
i meanyou encouraged me to go for the solo and then pulled the rug out from under me i see why you did what you did buti‚Äôm not going to solo now eventually the incentives will change i never close a door because things change turn to turn closing our door is only good for germany soit makes sense that she made you promise to close it,0,True,7,italy,england,1,436,Winter,1907
ok there‚Äôs something i want to share on the consition that this and future communications are just between the two of us think you can do that,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,437,Winter,1907
absolutely the moment i try to share something with germany she would say it to you so you can be sure i‚Äôll keep anything confidential,1,False,7,italy,england,1,438,Winter,1907
welll there‚Äôs a bit of an out of game thing affecting my play on some matters and i kind of want to leave this vague since this will be in a dataset and whatever but after the stab i thought the least i could do was make you aware,0,True,-7,england,italy,1,439,Winter,1907
what is the out of game thing,1,True,7,italy,england,1,440,Winter,1907
i have a neighbor who id really rather not brutally backstab and its not you clearly does that make sense,0,True,-7,england,italy,1,441,Winter,1907
sure,1,True,7,italy,england,1,442,Winter,1907
so what will you do if you wont solo,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,443,Spring,1908
well the solo is clearly off the table without your help i never would have made that play in the east i am outnumbered there and i will slowly melt away,1,True,7,italy,england,1,444,Spring,1908
so i will lose some centers and try to find someone who wants to work with me,1,True,7,italy,england,1,445,Spring,1908
well it sounds like you mean the solo right now you don‚Äôt think an eventual solo is off the table for you right,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,446,Spring,1908
eh anything can happen but i‚Äôm not really motivated to do that at this point i‚Äôd accept a draw right now if everyone was on board,0,True,7,italy,england,1,447,Spring,1908
you know i might be in the same boat there this game has invaded my life enough as it is i think i prefer inperson its a long day but when its done its done although you dont really get the fresh start you do with online things like i remember what you did to me last time come up when playing with friends,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,448,Spring,1908
my fiveway draw vote is up if you can rally the troops we can get to the interesting stats,0,True,7,italy,england,1,449,Spring,1908
i mean isn‚Äôt this getting called off in 1910 anyways that‚Äôs when the study ends and how does the draw vote work do people see what you voted if it doesn‚Äôt go through,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,450,Spring,1908
do your other moves not go through if you propose a draw,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,451,Spring,1908
i‚Äôm not sure how the draw vote works on backstabbr i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs visible but i believe you just have to go down to the scroll bar at the bottom that says ‚Äúsolo victory‚Äù and scroll down to ‚Äúfiveway draw‚Äù,0,True,7,italy,england,1,452,Spring,1908
well i‚Äôll see what i can do then the alternative is that we just duke it out for another couple of years until admin calls it,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,453,Spring,1908
austria sounds game for a draw,1,True,7,italy,england,1,454,Spring,1908
haha no surprise there just reached out to russia germany is sworn to fight against you till the end though a stab against me is inevitable too but maybe we can convince if all others are on board,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,455,Spring,1908
russia on board germany is the last holdout doesnt believe well draw or maybe doesnt want to id really also like to get people to mark adjudicate once all powers have issued orders as well just to get it over with,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,456,Spring,1908
i don‚Äôt really know what germany‚Äôs problem is i helped her a ton in this game it‚Äôs weird to me that she has such a vendetta,1,True,7,italy,england,1,457,Spring,1908
i guess it makes sense for her from a strategic standpoint to make me out to be a boogie man to get everyone headed this way,1,True,7,italy,england,1,458,Spring,1908
well i did expose some of your doubledealing to her which might have helped but yeah agreed that its in her interest to get everyone against you and then stab me when convenient,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,459,Spring,1908
sent to germany england austria russia so england germany russia y‚Äôall played a great turn last turn you got me to stab my longtime ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7year run as an alliance russia told me he was with me if i stab austria england told me he wanted me to solo so long as i would ‚Äúteach him‚Äù and help his along to second place then y‚Äôall pulled the rug out from under me it was clever and effective end part 1,1,True,7,italy,england,1,460,Spring,1908
part 2 at this stage my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit and of course i‚Äôm happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for ‚Äúhey i really want you to solo just help me place second‚Äù but if you guys just want to call it a fiveway draw among us and grab a beer together while reviewing the statistics that‚Äôs really my preference   i am outnumbered and i obviously can‚Äôt solo and i‚Äôm sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way but i expect russia and england to be careful and so i‚Äôm not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to germany‚Äôs favor   i propose that we draw and hug it outü§ó,0,True,7,italy,england,1,461,Spring,1908
reply all to italys message first if you didnt get a message from italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board please let me know im down for the draw that he has proposed id also like to add that ill be checking the adjudicate once all powers have issued orders box if everyone does this maybe we dont have to wait until sunday night to have this resolved im not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units but will be submitting for the 5way draw really enjoyed playing with you all but im exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,462,Spring,1908
zzzzzzzzzzz,1,True,7,italy,england,1,463,Fall,1908
any idea who didn‚Äôt want to draw,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,464,Fall,1908
i have a guess but no idea i have heard from nobody,1,True,7,italy,england,1,465,Fall,1908
huh i was thinking it‚Äôs possible the game was set up in some way to not respect the draw order i don‚Äôt know that much about the site and how the admin chose to configure the game,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,466,Fall,1908
oh that could be maybe it has to run to 1910,0,True,7,italy,england,1,467,Fall,1908
it‚Äôs not you is it,1,True,-7,england,italy,1,468,Winter,1908
i feel like its gotta be you holding out on the draw well good luck getting to 18 by the end of next year,1,,-7,england,italy,1,469,Winter,1908
hey good game i think folks are pretty much done i know i‚Äôm ready to move on the draw proposal combined with the impending end of the game was effective in making us slack on our moves a bit eg russia skipped a build this year i don‚Äôt know that i can say whether you have a clear path to a solo if we were to continue i know germany and i could at least get mao next year which would put pressure on por and spa i think we‚Äôd all appreciate a draw though otherwise it will be ‚Äúitaly kind of won but kind of didn‚Äôt because the game got cut short‚Äù up to you though,1,True,-8,england,italy,1,470,Spring,1910
hello italy what‚Äôs up what are your thoughts on austria and france,1,,0,turkey,italy,1,0,Spring,1901
hi turkey i‚Äôm sorry that i‚Äôve been so slow to get in touch kind of a rough day for me to begin a game as i e been pretty swamped things are clearing up now and i appreciate you reaching out to me   so far i have notes from austria and russia being pretty cagey and noncommittal perhaps that is just the life of italy nobody really has me in their plans  i don‚Äôt really know what i‚Äôm going to do yet so if you have ideas or you have a use for me please let me know i‚Äôd basically be delighted to work with anyone who really wants to work with me no sign yet that this includes anyone at all,0,True,0,italy,turkey,1,1,Spring,1901
hey turkey ‚Äî any interest in working together i‚Äôm trying to think of ideas but i‚Äôd just like to know first if you have interest and then we can work out a plan if you do,0,True,0,italy,turkey,1,2,Spring,1901
any thoughts turkey,1,True,0,italy,turkey,1,3,Spring,1901
sure we can work together austria would be the most likely candidate for us to maul,1,True,0,turkey,italy,1,4,Fall,1901
well here is a thought any chance you would support my army to greece  if you‚Äôd like to work together against austria i think a great move would be to ask austria to support you to rum and then support my army to greece instead   if you are game to do that i‚Äôd be happy to take down austria with you and work with you moving forward   thoughts,1,True,0,italy,turkey,1,5,Fall,1901
i will support you to greece üá¨üá∑,1,,0,turkey,italy,1,6,Fall,1901
i see what you are saying about rum i‚Äôm just not sure about lying in a game about lying or not,1,,0,turkey,italy,1,7,Fall,1901
let me think on it but yes to get that to work he has to not support to greece üá¨üá∑,1,,0,turkey,italy,1,8,Fall,1901
i think we can lull him into a sense of calm i really do and i think that he will tell one of us the truth so if you propose it he will mention it to me and we will know whether he is being honest,1,True,0,italy,turkey,1,9,Fall,1901
he said yes very quickly ,1,True,0,turkey,italy,1,10,Fall,1901
hi turkey ‚Äî just fyi i think i‚Äôm better off just grabbing the easy build in tunis this turn so no need to support me to greece just yet perhaps we can move on austria next year,1,,0,italy,turkey,1,11,Fall,1901
i hope you‚Äôve had a great weekend just so you know i‚Äôm secretly hoping you build a smyrna f constantinople ü§û ü§û,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,1,12,Winter,1901
i certainly like that build thoughts on how we can work together here,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,1,13,Spring,1902
hmm i think austria is moving to tyrol and coming after you,1,True,1,turkey,italy,1,14,Spring,1902
not sure but he‚Äôs got a lot of units and he does lie,1,True,1,turkey,italy,1,15,Spring,1902
hi turkey  i am facing a critical decision point here i‚Äôd really like to make a deal with you   i‚Äôve just learned that austriarussia have a deal in place to attack you austria has promised russia bulgaria in exchange for russia‚Äôs help against you it‚Äôs pretty clear to me that i am austria‚Äôs second choice for an ally and i don‚Äôt want to help ar take you down just to be their next snack,0,,-1,italy,turkey,1,16,Fall,1902
the current ar plan is for austria to double support russia to bulgaria moscow is headed up to stp with sev supporting ukr to bul i am supposed to make a surprise move towards france   ar expects you to cover smyrna and does not expect you to attack sev given all the units surrounding you,0,False,-1,italy,turkey,1,17,Fall,1902
we have a terrific counter if you‚Äôd like to work with me   i can tap greece and aegean which should allow you to save bulgaria const s bulgaria holding at the same time black sea support armenia to sevastopol will work i‚Äôm planning to move over to trieste so the end result of all this would be turkey regaining sev and remaining at 5 while i take trieste and get to 5 from there i think we should be able to work together to finish off austria,0,,-1,italy,turkey,1,18,Fall,1902
i know that‚Äôs a lot to take in i‚Äôm sorry to kind of dump all of this on you but i just learned basically that austria is prioritizing russia‚Äôs growth over mine and i can see the writing on the wall i‚Äôd very much like to turn the tables on him can we do this,0,,-1,italy,turkey,1,19,Fall,1902

hello thoughts on how you like to play as italy,1,,0,france,italy,1,0,Spring,1901
hi france  well i generally don‚Äôt like to play as italy at all frankly but when i do i go east not sure whether i‚Äôll head towards turkey or austria but i think the one big advantage that you and i both have is that we have a mutual border that is easy to keep clear   i‚Äôm not moving west it takes forever to get there and there are rarely centers there for me when i arrive i hope you feel the same way about moving towards me   i‚Äôd like to keep our border clear and i‚Äôd like to act as ‚Äútrio wires‚Äù for each other basically if either germany or england want to attack you i expect they‚Äôll mention something to me and if you‚Äôll look out for me diplomatically i‚Äôll give you a head‚Äôs up if ever you need to worry   how do you like to play france,0,True,0,italy,france,1,1,Spring,1901
im happy to hear that i have the same opinion when it comes down to our relationship i prefer to play france decisevely in the west when an opportunity presents itself since that opportunity might not present itself for a long time i often times end up playing a bit more reactively  id love to be trio wires ive heard from everyone in the east but not much substance which probably means a bunch of passive openings  if theres little fighting between the eastern powers it might make it tougher for us so hopefully things will shake up a bit in that department if you are also finding that there isnt a whole lot of commitment going on there and you have some interest in an unorthodox play then maybe there is some potential for us to work together directly,1,True,0,france,italy,1,2,Spring,1901
yeah everyone is cagey and conservative at least in words if you have thoughts on something unorthodox i love that kind of plan so i‚Äôd love to hear it,1,True,0,italy,france,1,3,Spring,1901
ha ‚Äî i meant ‚Äútrip wire‚Äù above that should make more sense,1,True,0,italy,france,1,4,Spring,1901
but i appreciate that you also agreed to be ‚Äútrio wires‚Äù ü§£,1,True,0,italy,france,1,5,Spring,1901
that is funny i was thinking that trio referred to the 3 westerneastern countries üòÇ  in terms of unorthodox plans i was thinking that if you moved to tyrolia and venice it would appear to be an attack on austria but that we could then perform a joint attack on munich instead im not sure if you actually want munich or to get embroiled in germany but i thought id throw it out there,1,True,0,france,italy,1,6,Spring,1901
heads up england is sniffing around wants to know if i‚Äôd be in to move to piedmont if he takes the channel,0,True,0,italy,france,1,7,Spring,1901

ohi don‚Äôt know looks like i may be destined to become one of those foreverstuckonfour italys that flounders about for a while and then dies üòî  germany seems very passive you seem aggressive and pointed away from me which warms my heart   what are your thoughts on the board,1,True,0,italy,france,1,14,Fall,1901
true us staying out of eachothers way is what allowed me to be a bit more aggressive so thank you for that üôÇ it looks like russia and turkey are squabbling which is probably great for austria who started off very strong i agree that germany is a bit passive and now does not have the option to prevent russia from taking sweden its tough to read england you may have some opportunities if everyone is on board with the lepanto and could possibly convince austria to give you a center,1,,0,france,italy,1,15,Fall,1901
i am only using my downward thumb for germany so far he keeps telling me transparent lies about you lol   let‚Äôs please never fight the bad guys are going to try to make us fight let‚Äôs just not,0,,0,italy,france,1,16,Fall,1901
thanks for the heads up i agree completely as a side note do you have a read on england by any chance i want to work with him at this point but he seems to be on the fence about it,1,True,0,france,italy,1,17,Fall,1901
i haven‚Äôt really heard much from him i think i disappointed him when i said ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù on piedmont let me reach out to him now and see if i can get a read,0,True,0,italy,france,1,18,Fall,1901
i have been presuming that i don‚Äôt need to say ‚Äúa fleet in marseilles would make my skin crawl‚Äù but maybe i should say it,1,True,-1,italy,france,1,19,Winter,1901
in this case my hand was forced and i had to build armies i dont anticipate building a fleet in marseilles in fact that turn right there may have been my last build phase ever but if that changes then i will certainly give you heads up,1,True,1,france,italy,1,20,Spring,1902
have you and austria thought about ways to slow down englandgermany in case they decide to alliance and pick  up scandinavia and french dots i would be fully supportive of an attack on munich,1,True,1,france,italy,1,21,Spring,1902
i think we have a lot to do in the east before we make that kind of move any chance you can get england on your side,1,True,-1,italy,france,1,22,Spring,1902
true the east is looking very nice for you and austria  im working on it but it is tough and i am of course worried about the fleet london build and germany building 2 armies if england is no longer asking you to attack me then that would be a good sign,1,True,1,france,italy,1,23,Spring,1902
well i‚Äôm just a fourcenter italy let‚Äôs not get too excited yet   i haven‚Äôt heard a thing from england in quite a while no idea what he‚Äôs thinking,1,True,-1,italy,france,1,24,Spring,1902
hey just thought id contact you and offer you some centers üòÇ üòÇ,1,False,1,france,italy,1,25,Fall,1902
i wanted to tell you sooner but the bot was down,1,False,1,france,italy,1,26,Fall,1902
you just got two thumbs down,1,True,-1,italy,france,1,27,Fall,1902
good luck this turn,1,True,-1,italy,france,1,28,Fall,1902
should we talk builds i‚Äôd like to avoid f mar,1,True,-1,italy,france,1,29,Winter,1902
sure i wont build a fleet in mar,1,True,1,france,italy,1,30,Winter,1902
im sure you have plans in the near term already set have you put any thought into how you would like the mid game to look like,1,True,1,france,italy,1,31,Winter,1902
ohi‚Äôm planning on killing both austria and turkey if i can though not sure yet how i‚Äôm going to pull it off any ideas,1,True,-1,italy,france,1,32,Winter,1902
hmm i imagine turkey falls first it was smart of you to take greece so that austria is the one at the front of the attack once austria has committed deep into turkey you should have plenty of opportunities i think it would be a matter of just waiting for the right time russia may be interested in working with you since his interests and austrias interests are probably not as aligned in the long term,1,True,1,france,italy,1,33,Spring,1903
the bot is back up üòÉ,1,True,1,france,italy,1,34,Fall,1903
sorry for the delay just looking at the game again now,1,,-1,italy,france,1,35,Fall,1903
hi friend are you still there,1,True,-1,italy,france,1,36,Fall,1903
basically i am getting a bit of an ultimatum from my friends in the east and i would like to arrange for a feint in your direction this turn to set up an attack on austria but i want to share it with you first,0,True,-1,italy,france,1,37,Fall,1903
i believe i am getting a build this turn crossing my fingers and i plan to build a ven to set up an invasion of austria,0,False,-1,italy,france,1,38,Fall,1903
but that only works if he doesn‚Äôt see it coming so my plan is to use tyrolia to support hold munich this turn it‚Äôs the only way to keep that army in tyr and to move my fleets to tys and tun then i build a ven and i attack trieste while austria heads towards russia and i circle my fleets back around austria,0,False,-1,italy,france,1,39,Fall,1903
the one fly in the ointment is that it requires some trust from my light blue friend in the west i can only hope that we‚Äôve built up enough rapport that you understand where i‚Äôm coming from here and you let me engage in this bit of sleight of hand,0,True,-1,italy,france,1,40,Fall,1903
just saw the moves and then read your messages ok i trust you but dont fuck me on this i do have a back up plan but id like to not go there üòÅ,0,True,1,france,italy,1,41,Fall,1903
i like this response,1,,-1,italy,france,1,42,Fall,1903
you‚Äôre going to like my next move set and you‚Äôre not going to need your backup plan,0,,-1,italy,france,1,43,Fall,1903
i think the key here is to get germany back on your side england is not wavering he sent me a case of champaign for my last move,0,,0,italy,france,1,44,Spring,1904
thanks yes england has ceased all communications with me by now,1,True,0,france,italy,1,45,Spring,1904
such a charmer,1,True,0,italy,france,1,46,Spring,1904
nothing to say after that last turn,1,True,0,france,italy,1,47,Fall,1904
hey sorry i try to be more communicative just a very long day for me yesterday   you seem to have sniffed out my attack quite well and now i‚Äôm facing austria getting 2 builds while i likely get none sobad turn for me and it may cost me the game   i stabbed you there‚Äôs no getting around that perhaps it is some solace to you that i may have completely yanked my own game in doing so,1,True,0,italy,france,1,48,Fall,1904
it is what it is a stab on austria has sailed past for the time being but with any of these grand alliances there will be another opportunity later provided that austria doesnt stab you first im going to do what i believe will maximize my chances of survival and if that means working with you then i wont hold that grudge it depends how creative you are willing to get given english communications with me i cant imagine that they are easy to work with,1,True,0,france,italy,1,49,Fall,1904
id like to float the option of your fleets sailing past mine and into the mid atlantic this obviously runs great risks for myself but i believe i have a higher chance of survival in the long run this way i also believe it may be in your best interests as well you want to get past the stalemate lines and this is the best way to do it,1,True,0,france,italy,1,50,Fall,1904
builds are a problem for you but they will be anyway as you have to make a coin flip guess on spainmarseilles on the other hand austria has two guaranteed builds and more coming given the nature of that alliance im sure austria may be willing to share those builds with you,1,True,0,france,italy,1,51,Fall,1904
im in a tough spot but i also believe in the long run thats why i want to be clear that im not desperate i wont be selling myself to whoever will support me on any given turn from my perspective i just need one unit to be in a draw so if theres a slim chance for me to be a one unit survivor in a monster italyaustria draw ill help you and austria as much as i can,1,True,0,france,italy,1,52,Fall,1904
any thoughts for me how would you go about making a frenchitaly alliance work,1,True,0,france,italy,1,53,Fall,1904
hey so i really appreciate this string of messages,1,True,0,italy,france,1,54,Fall,1904
just really strong diplomacy flexible fun mutual advantage seeking my kind of player,1,True,0,italy,france,1,55,Fall,1904
i will respond to honesty with honesty i really need a build this turn i am concerned about two austrian builds setting me up to get stabbed for that reason i am very much inclined to take my 5050 shot at a french center this turn,1,True,0,italy,france,1,56,Fall,1904
on the other hand i quite like the idea of sending my fleets passed you,1,True,0,italy,france,1,57,Fall,1904
soi really like your message and i‚Äôm trying to think how it could all work,1,True,0,italy,france,1,58,Fall,1904
but i don‚Äôt know if i can give up my 5050 shot at a build i need a build or i likely get stabbed i‚Äôm afraid,1,True,0,italy,france,1,59,Fall,1904
also england is very much set up to get stabbed by a surprise if here i mean that would be super fun,1,True,0,italy,france,1,60,Fall,1904
i will tell you this england and germany are both very interested in your demise and that makes you a more attractive ally for me as i don‚Äôt want to see ef grow strong and grow affectionate after breaking bread in paris,1,True,0,italy,france,1,61,Fall,1904
so i guess what i‚Äôm saying is allow me a build this turn and i‚Äôd be quite happy to push to be in irish sea next year,1,True,0,italy,france,1,62,Fall,1904
you might find yourself in a bit of a janissary position but you won‚Äôt have to fear that i‚Äôll just stab you for all your centers because i would be far to early to make a solo run and i‚Äôd just invite backlash from the rest of the board i‚Äôm not a dimwit who strikes out on poorly considered solo runs too early,1,True,0,italy,france,1,63,Fall,1904
i do it at exactly the right time ü§≠,1,True,0,italy,france,1,64,Fall,1904
thoughts,1,True,0,italy,france,1,65,Fall,1904
also it would do you some good to prevent germany from taking burgundy this year my head is spinning a bit from a really fun 1905 in which i support you into munich and move to north atlantic on the same turn,1,True,0,italy,france,1,66,Fall,1904
im really glad that you are entertaining a plan like this you call it strong diplomacy but it only works because you are constantly looking for the best opportunities and going after them i can get you a build i thought about ways to do it subtly but i wonder if it might just be better to go in for it i can send a fleet from mao to nao unopposed if you get a fleet into mao this will set up an unstoppable convoy directly into clyde the best way to do this would probably be to have you convoy piedmont to spain using the gulf of lyons and use west med to take mao thus allowing a future spain to clyde convoy,1,True,0,france,italy,1,67,Fall,1904
i am going to support an attack into mar or spa i will not move to both but if you move to nao and keep germany out of burgundy i will absolutely come out guns blazing against england next year and maybe germany too,0,,0,italy,france,1,68,Fall,1904
done this gets a bit weird since the move is only really effective if you follow me into mao and if you tell me that then in theory i know how to defend so instead of you telling me your moves ill just tell you mine i believe that i can move to nao prevent germany from taking burundy and hit marseilles with a force of two all at once this move set will leave spain and mao unguarded and you will be able to walk in to both if you choose to do that i believe we can guarantee liverpool next year,1,True,0,france,italy,1,69,Fall,1904
my best guess is that germany will try to take belgium this turn and if she does ideally that build will be a fleet my gut feeling is that while germany may not like me very much she seems to trust you if you work your diplomatic magic i think she would be happy to build a fleet and attack england with her fleets,1,True,0,france,italy,1,70,Fall,1904
hmmmm i need to stop giving you thumbs ups you‚Äôre ruining my truth detector score,1,True,2,italy,france,1,71,Winter,1904
kind of a pointless lie if you ask me but i won‚Äôt hold it against you you‚Äôre in a tough spot,1,True,2,italy,france,1,72,Winter,1904
well maybe not since it was a truth when i sent it out but it seemed like you were not interested in going to the mid atlantic ocean based on your messages and i felt like it would be pointless to go to nao if you were not headed to mao the other part of the equation was the fact that i offered you spain for free and you passed that up in favor of a guess maybe you didnt trust me but it got me thinking about why you would pass on a deal like that,1,False,-2,france,italy,1,73,Winter,1904
also given the moves you attacked both spain and marseilles moved out of tyrolia and germany did not attack burgundy so theres also that üòÜ,1,False,-2,france,italy,1,74,Winter,1904
i get that there was a better way to handle this and i should have let you know that the move to nao was off i really am sorry about that but you have to know that i was 100 serious about attacking england with you i make crazy unnexpected plays like that all the time in high stakes diplomacy games so for a game thats more of a beta test than game its natural and we can still do it too id love to hear your suggestions on how to make it stick and its something germany is certainly interested in as well,1,False,-2,france,italy,1,75,Winter,1904
i‚Äôm giving you a bunch of these üëé for those comments,1,,2,italy,france,1,76,Winter,1904
you made a deal with me and did something else instead that doesn‚Äôt mean i won‚Äôt consider another deal but i don‚Äôt want you to think that is lost on me,1,,2,italy,france,1,77,Winter,1904
hey look i know your upset i hope you can see things from my point of view though i was in the heat of the moment and i really really really wanted this to work it would be so fun and i could finally get back at england for being a total piece of crap and then i sobered up and read between the lines and realized how terrible your deal would be for me as it turns out you werent actually offering me anything i wanted to work with you so badly i had convinced myself to make awful moves so if you want to downvote all my messages you can kiss your truth telling ratio good bye keep it up and it will be lower than mine üòò,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,78,Winter,1904
well let me know if you want to talk about anything else,1,,2,italy,france,1,79,Winter,1904
and by the way i think the deal i offered was pretty good for you ‚Äî much better than doing nothing it did not give you anything in the shortterm but that was because i had a shortterm need and no reason to make a sacrifice to you to get a deal done i proposed a deal that was good for me because i intended to follow through,1,,2,italy,france,1,80,Winter,1904
you may get better proposals from others but not better proposals that they intend to actually follow through on,1,,2,italy,france,1,81,Winter,1904
seems like you‚Äôve decided to write me off as someone who can be useful to you and so you‚Äôre going to spread lies to others about me instead,1,True,2,italy,france,1,82,Spring,1905
that stuff gets back to me,1,True,2,italy,france,1,83,Spring,1905
you don‚Äôt owe me anything and i attacked you so i won‚Äôt begrudge you your vengeance but that said i was pretty darn sincere when i said i thought there was a way forward for us,1,False,2,italy,france,1,84,Spring,1905
all i wanted from you was for us to kill england first get you past the stalemate lines and then you can circle back for french dots i even offered you spain for free if you really were interested in something like this you would not only have your build but be in clyde  thats the thing though you dont want to be there you want me to be there so that you can keep pretending to be on englands side and you want your units to be in france  i dont doubt you were sincere but launching an ineffective attack on england while italy eats me from behind in the hopes that eventually italy soloes even though hes going to get stopped at the stalemate lines because italy just has to be friends with england not a fan if theres a way forward its with you sending a fleet to mao and putting your fleets past the lines or its with you withdrawing and finally stabbing austria like you said you would a few years ago  all youve done so far is build an eg alliance and waste both of our time in the med with all your grand talk i just thought you had a better plan than this,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,85,Spring,1905
at the very least you should be trying to get england and germany to fight at this rate they will continue to get french dots while you still are stuck at 0 you have so many units on the western front that it honestly makes no sense for you to share spoils with eg,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,86,Spring,1905
i appreciate the advice if i feel like you sincerely want to work with me i‚Äôll be much more inclined to encourage england and germany to fight honestly i‚Äôm quite sure that you and i working together could accomplish that very quickly but lately i‚Äôm learning that you‚Äôre mostly trying to get people to distrust me,1,True,2,italy,france,1,87,Spring,1905
so i think we‚Äôre going to have some trouble bridging this gap,1,True,2,italy,france,1,88,Spring,1905
if you‚Äôd like to give your centers to england and germany a kind of payback to me that‚Äôs certainly within your power it‚Äôs not how i‚Äôd like this game to go but there may be satisfaction in that for you,1,True,2,italy,france,1,89,Spring,1905
ok i get that you are concerned by me spreading rumors but you and i havent exactly been working together so i feel like trying to get england to stop attacking me is a fair message to send maybe you dont know this but ive sent england a message every season for the past 9 or 10 seasons and they have ignored each message in fact im so glad you told me about this since it proves that england is reading my messages and just not responding to them,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,90,Fall,1905
you seem to have interpreted this as some kind of vengeance against you thats not the case im literally just trying to survive here,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,91,Fall,1905
and while i cant confirm it i heavily suspect you have your own little group with england and germany where you all slander me plenty üòâ ,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,92,Fall,1905
well you have choices about who to work with let me know if you ever get serious about working with me,1,False,2,italy,france,1,93,Fall,1905
anyway i‚Äôm just going to keep flipping a coin over marseilles or spain one day i‚Äôll guess it right,1,True,2,italy,france,1,94,Fall,1905
i think the best way to work together at this point is an italian withdrawal the good thing is that this is pretty easy if you move to ionian you can convoy piedmont to greecealbania,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,95,Fall,1905
the reason why is that england has already brought their fleets around and even if we could get you into the mao theyve already set up a line that we would struggle immensely to cross,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,96,Fall,1905
at some point english channel will plug up irish sea and nwg will go to nao what im saying is that its too late the opportunity is gone,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,97,Fall,1905
maybe if germany turns on england but is that even possible at this point just looking at the board and the moves i think they are along for the full ride,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,98,Fall,1905
obviously you can potentially gain if you keep attacking me but i think thats gamblers fallacy actually you wont one day guess it right theoretically its possible for me to always be right,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,99,Fall,1905
that‚Äôs not the gambler‚Äôs fallacy and it‚Äôs not unreasonable to think that if i keep flipping a coin one of these days it will turn up heads,1,True,2,italy,france,1,100,Fall,1905
if you‚Äôd like to work with me all you need to do is leave either spain or marseilles open and tell me which one i‚Äôll take one build and the two of us will round the corner,0,False,2,italy,france,1,101,Fall,1905
and you wont take any of my other centers until we wipe out englandat the moment im defending both,0,True,-2,france,italy,1,102,Fall,1905
its not unreasonable at all just france happens to be tough to kill and compounded onto that im a very lucky person üòâ,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,103,Fall,1905
if you are using your units to move towards england and i feel i can trust you i‚Äôm not going to take your other centers that would be foolish of me to do,1,False,2,italy,france,1,104,Fall,1905
hmm any way we can do this without having me go down a unit if you move to mao im pretty sure youll get in,0,True,-2,france,italy,1,105,Fall,1905
that just isn‚Äôt a good deal for me everything on the board says i should work with england against you and so i plan to give him mao if i think i have a loyal france who wants to do something fun i‚Äôm willing to shake things up but without that i‚Äôm not just going to call off my attack,1,True,2,italy,france,1,106,Fall,1905
nice moves you made the right call,1,True,-2,france,italy,1,107,Fall,1905
well thank you you won 3 coin flips in a row so the congratulations is for you i was bound to get lucky eventually,1,True,2,italy,france,1,108,Fall,1905
i do appreciate some of the misdirection stuff that you‚Äôve done i‚Äôll mention it after the game but good stuff,1,True,2,italy,france,1,109,Fall,1905
i think your play had to be to try to get austria to stab me on one of the last few turns but it didn‚Äôt quite work out,1,True,4,italy,france,1,110,Winter,1905
thanks you saw right through it so it didnt actually end up helping üòÇ yeah i was hoping to stall this out for longer but at this point ive got to choose a side and throw to them me moving to nao was an olive branch short of giving you a free dot,1,True,-4,france,italy,1,111,Winter,1905
yeah if i were you i would have approached it the same way you did hold out longer than most would getting triple teamed but you needed someone elsewhere on the board to see that it was bad for them for you to fall,1,True,4,italy,france,1,112,Winter,1905
if i get a say in how my dots are distributed id like them to go to you and germany im not sure how good your relationship with germany is but put in a good word for you with them whatever the case youve set this game up brilliantly to the point where i would not be surprised to see you solo,1,True,-4,france,italy,1,113,Winter,1905
you are cordially welcomed to distribute dots to me at any time and for any reason,1,,4,italy,france,1,114,Spring,1906
and i like germany too,1,,4,italy,france,1,115,Spring,1906
if you are interested in retreating to irish i would take support to the channel in fall if you‚Äôll offer it could be interesting,0,True,4,italy,france,1,116,Spring,1906
sure actually changed my retreat to the irish,1,True,-4,france,italy,1,117,Spring,1906
cool,1,True,4,italy,france,1,118,Spring,1906
if you are interested we can move marseilles up into burgundy as well,1,True,-4,france,italy,1,119,Fall,1906
well that would be amazing for me so this is exactly the sort of creative arrangement i was talking about earlier   mao  channel wes  mao mar  bur pie  mar lyo s pie  mar,0,False,4,italy,france,1,120,Fall,1906
is germany going to keep paris,1,True,4,italy,france,1,121,Fall,1906
yeah i think germany probably will given the situation very awesome orders i am all for it,1,True,-4,france,italy,1,122,Fall,1906
i kind of love these orders,0,False,4,italy,france,1,123,Fall,1906
they are not what anyone will expect and i can play them off as both progerman and proenglish,0,False,4,italy,france,1,124,Fall,1906
are we still okay with the channel plan germany has been asking me about it and it seems like she doesn‚Äôt like the plan i‚Äôm also nervous about her tipping off england do we really need to run everything by her,1,True,4,italy,france,1,125,Fall,1906
i am i wont share any other info with germany i figured shed want to know about the plan before it happened but i think it just made her more worried,1,True,-4,france,italy,1,126,Fall,1906
cool thank you,1,True,4,italy,france,1,127,Fall,1906
here are my orders this turn if you‚Äôd like to grant me spain i‚Äôll raise hell with that build but i‚Äôm okay with you hanging onto it right now if you support me to channel   mao  channel lyo  spa wes s lyo  spa mar  bur pie  mar,0,False,4,italy,france,1,128,Fall,1906
sounds good im not much use to you without supply centers so for now i plan to support spain to hold moving west med to mao may be a good idea since then you could get more fleets in action,0,True,-4,france,italy,1,129,Fall,1906
hmmm both england and germany are sniffing around trying to get my moves what should i tell them,1,True,4,italy,france,1,130,Fall,1906
eh sorry i got a good offer from the bad guys,1,True,4,italy,france,1,131,Fall,1906
my plan has changed,1,True,4,italy,france,1,132,Fall,1906
haha it was too late to change my orders but it hardly would have mattered it is not yet clear what you get out of that deal but i guess it will be apparent to me next year surprised if you were going to stab me that you didnt go for portugal with mao,1,True,-9,france,italy,1,133,Winter,1906
yeah i just figured that you might keep your last unit alive as a janissary if i kept portugal blue,1,True,9,italy,france,1,134,Winter,1906
you played well this game and frankly one of the reasons i attacked you was that you seemed like you‚Äôd outplay me eventually if you were given room to breath,1,True,9,italy,france,1,135,Winter,1906
i respect and appreciate if you want to hold out in portugal or gascony but if you‚Äôd like to keep playing one option would be to keep irish on the board and then support me to nao in spring then we take a shot at liverpool i desperately need fleets on that side of mao so if you keep helping me i have every reason in the world to keep portugal blue,1,True,9,italy,france,1,136,Winter,1906
i was thinking about keeping irish for sure i dont have home centers so i have all the incentive in the world to help you and germany as much as i can that makes things completely safe for you and germany as i have no benefit from gaining another dot another option is to keep picardy with the goal of popping brest and taking the channel thanks for the kind words though i think you shouldnt have worried about me too much somewhere along the line i kind of majorly pissed off england and i think germany probably works with them against me due to having only 1 fleet at the time so i would have been fighting a 2v1 anyway if you had done your own thing in the east,1,True,-9,france,italy,1,137,Winter,1906
the ultimate fun would a convoy of spain to liverpool in the spring,1,True,9,italy,france,1,138,Winter,1906
so thoughts on where to go from here,1,True,9,italy,france,1,139,Spring,1907
perhaps you‚Äôd like support to brest,0,True,9,italy,france,1,140,Spring,1907
i‚Äôm going to go ahead and plug in that support though possible that england might cut it,0,True,9,italy,france,1,141,Spring,1907
already ordered not sure if you and germany are coordinating but when i spoke with her she said she wanted me to move to brest to pop the england fleet as well,1,True,-9,france,italy,1,142,Spring,1907
yes we talked it through üòä,1,True,9,italy,france,1,143,Spring,1907
hello brother ‚Äî how are things going in brest,1,True,9,italy,france,1,144,Fall,1907
not bad havent had anyone tell me what im supposed to do there so i guess im just holding,0,True,-9,france,italy,1,145,Fall,1907
well that‚Äôs an interesting thing to say i‚Äôve heard lots of people telling me what you‚Äôre supposed to do but they have more to gain by lying i suppose,1,True,9,italy,france,1,146,Fall,1907
what am i supposed to do haha,1,True,-9,france,italy,1,147,Fall,1907
you are instructed to move to channel as far as i understand,1,True,9,italy,france,1,148,Fall,1907
good game france üá´üá∑,1,True,13,italy,france,1,149,Winter,1907
thanks gg,1,,-13,france,italy,1,150,Winter,1907
hello there whats your general plan for this game my inclination when i play austria is to piss off as few people as possible so i dont plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn,1,True,0,austria,germany,1,0,Spring,1901
im not trying to step on anyones toes just yet either specifically im happy to keep bohemia and tyrolia demilitarized for at least a couple seasons to our mutual benefit,1,True,0,germany,austria,1,1,Spring,1901
sounds good to me,1,True,0,austria,germany,1,2,Spring,1901
i appreciate you sticking to your word italy tells me you two are close allies and might be willing to consider me a third central power i wanted to hear your thoughts on this,1,True,0,germany,austria,1,3,Fall,1901
absolutely true i think the three of us could do great things together,1,True,0,austria,germany,1,4,Fall,1901
im starting to agree,1,,0,germany,austria,1,5,Fall,1901
if you dont mind my asking why the bounce in tri and why the deception of turkey im no expert but to me these moves indicate you dont really trust italy at all,1,True,0,germany,austria,1,6,Winter,1901
i want to keep turkey guessing and offkilter,1,True,0,austria,germany,1,7,Winter,1901
so the bounce was just to conceal your true relationship with italy,1,True,0,germany,austria,1,8,Winter,1901
essentially yes,1,True,0,austria,germany,1,9,Winter,1901
whats your plan in the balkans this season i was wondering about putting some pressure on russia by having me move into silesia while you move into galicia,1,True,0,germany,austria,1,10,Spring,1902
i dont want to pressure russia too much until the turk is taken care of i dont think it makes sense for me to antagonize them both,1,True,0,austria,germany,1,11,Spring,1902
i thought your answer might be that makes sense carry on,1,True,0,germany,austria,1,12,Spring,1902
not sure if this is obvious but russia indicated to me that they are prioritizing defending rumania over ankara in case that changes your and italys plans for that region congrats by the way on crushing turkey,1,True,-2,germany,austria,1,13,Spring,1904
thanks for the notice i figure one or the other has gotta work first and then the second will work once the first has,1,True,2,austria,germany,1,14,Spring,1904
it seems italy is finally showing their true colors care to join the dark side,1,True,1,germany,austria,1,15,Fall,1907
im sure youre already on top of this but if we can all recognize italy as the enemy then your best bet right now is to try and team up with russia maybe offer to disband arm bla and gal in exchange for support from vie into bud i am wholly committed to cutting any attempted disrupts from tyr,1,True,4,germany,austria,1,16,Winter,1907
support from vie for rum into bud,1,True,4,germany,austria,1,17,Winter,1907
actually might be better to dissolve rum instead of bla and let gal into bud,1,True,4,germany,austria,1,18,Winter,1907
at any rate heres a direct quote to me from russia and yes ill happily support him meaning you austria to budapest if he ever fecking starts talking to me again,1,True,4,germany,austria,1,19,Winter,1907
whats your train of thought on the draw,1,True,-4,austria,germany,1,20,Spring,1908
ive already submitted my moves marked myself down for the 5way draw and checked adjudicate once all players have submitted im ready to be done,1,True,4,germany,austria,1,21,Spring,1908
ive had a lot of fun though,1,True,4,germany,austria,1,22,Spring,1908
so did you veto the draw,1,True,-4,austria,germany,1,23,Winter,1908
nope it might actually just not be allowed by the game settings because it makes no sense that someone would lie about this with the game so close to ending anyway,1,True,4,germany,austria,1,24,Winter,1908
gday  just wanted to check in assure you im not the sort to pull a crazy ivan off the bat and try to shove all my units through silpru from the start  aside from that id of course love to be able to pick up sweden and if theres anything particular we can discuss to stay at least positivelyneutral toward each other let me know,1,True,1,russia,germany,1,0,Spring,1901
privyeti wont trouble you in sweden or silpru if you dont trouble me in denmark meanwhile i was wondering if you agree with me that this game has just a little too much austria in it,1,True,-1,germany,russia,1,1,Spring,1901
that sounds fair enough  and ill pretty much always agree that there should generally only be one germany unified,1,False,1,russia,germany,1,2,Spring,1901
are you nervous at all about defending sweden from england,1,True,0,germany,russia,1,3,Spring,1902
of course i am its just not my top concern üòÄ,1,True,0,russia,germany,1,4,Spring,1902
well no kidding you and turkey have quite a little spat going was just curious if you and england had any kind of agreement in place or if you might be wanting my help in a couple seasons,0,True,0,germany,russia,1,5,Spring,1902
meh most likely outcome is i get sev back in exchange for black and austria decides the date of rum that areas still fluid and sure i might want help looking north in a season or two lemme just straighten that southern mess first,1,True,0,russia,germany,1,6,Spring,1902
england told me youre assisting them to take denmark this year is this true would you consider not doing that,1,True,0,germany,russia,1,7,Fall,1902
sorry did not see your message until this morning,1,True,2,russia,germany,1,8,Winter,1902
i have as you may have noticed ceased all support of england in harassing you,1,True,2,russia,germany,1,9,Fall,1903
noted and appreciated can‚Äôt help but notice you‚Äôre in marvelous position to try and swipe berlin though,1,True,-3,germany,russia,1,10,Winter,1903
hahaa no i already regret the damage ive done to you and have no desire to exacerbate it,1,True,3,russia,germany,1,11,Winter,1903
well the feeling is mutual i wanted to let you know that austria asked for my help putting pressure on warsaw i dont intend to do that but i recommend you use silesia to support your rumanian unit into galicia i promise not to interfere with this maneuver if you promise to keep your baltic fleet focused on defending sweden from england,1,,-3,germany,russia,1,12,Spring,1904
assuming as i have that you consider rumania a lost cause at this point no offense meant if you dont im still pretty new at this game,1,True,-3,germany,russia,1,13,Spring,1904
eventually if he presses it hard enough ankara is the more immediate loss now its just a matter of seeing how patient he is pressing in on me while italy becomes a softer target of he keeps pressing west,1,True,3,russia,germany,1,14,Spring,1904
sorry who do you mean by he,1,True,-3,germany,russia,1,15,Spring,1904
austria the only one who can press rumania üòÄ,1,True,3,russia,germany,1,16,Spring,1904
ah right okay well do let me know if theres anything i can do to help esp if youre willing to support me into denmark this year and then i could support you into sweden in the fall,0,True,-3,germany,russia,1,17,Spring,1904
hate to be a bother but im not going to have much time to strategerize tomorrow,1,True,-3,germany,russia,1,18,Spring,1904
you and me both  i literally just got home and logged in  one sec,1,True,3,russia,germany,1,19,Spring,1904
damn thats a hard one to weigh  its objectively the right move just not sure how much i want to cement being in a fight with him vs the slim chance hes actually going to do the holding pattern he claims,1,True,3,russia,germany,1,20,Spring,1904
yeah i think on balance i have to give him the option to follow through and have a reason to deescalate with me so he can join the dogpile on france  odds are high im going to regret the decision and end up offering you that support in the fall when you cant reciprocate but i gotta take the chance with austria obviously spoiling for a fight,1,True,3,russia,germany,1,21,Spring,1904
that makes sense i do think england will follow through anyway,1,,-3,germany,russia,1,22,Spring,1904
to be clear you mean the same holding pattern you two had last year right i just want to confirm so i can feel secure that neither england nor you will try to swipe kiel from me this season,1,True,-3,germany,russia,1,23,Spring,1904
lol  yes basically repeating by arrangement the same moves we did last turn without agreement  fecker tried to dot me üòÉ,1,True,3,russia,germany,1,24,Spring,1904
are you and england planning to highfive in sweden and norway again this turn  i still think supporting rumania into gal from sil is a good move for you its getting to the point where if im able to rebuild a unit this winter i think itd be worth teaming up to knock austria down a peg,1,True,-3,germany,russia,1,25,Fall,1904
stop reading my orders,1,True,3,russia,germany,1,26,Fall,1904
and yeah i shoulda gone with my gut last turn to support ank  con but in the long run didnt really matter  theyd eventually guess right on those two dots üòÉ,1,True,3,russia,germany,1,27,Fall,1904
yeah theres nothing you can really do when two powers team up so seamlessly like that youre still doing much better than me though,1,True,-3,germany,russia,1,28,Fall,1904
england has been talking with me about a russiagermanyengland alliance and i agree with them that its the only thing that makes sense in the face of the austriaitaly powerhouse i assume englands been speaking with you as well and just wanted to confirm the three of us are on the same page   on that note the moves i have planned for this year are all geared towards attacking the west but i am happy to change my plans if you want some support or coordination to the east,1,True,0,germany,russia,1,29,Spring,1905
yes im all about fecking with austriaitaly right now üòÄ,1,True,0,russia,germany,1,30,Spring,1905
well let me know if theres anything i can do to help,1,True,0,germany,russia,1,31,Fall,1905
italy told me theyre not planning on staying in vienna are they going to give it to you i admit that my main interest here is finding out if munich is safe this season,1,True,-1,germany,russia,1,32,Fall,1906
im not touching munich but he hasnt said anything to me about vienna,1,True,1,russia,germany,1,33,Fall,1906
well youd be silly not to take it unless you have assurance from austria or italy that theyre not supporting each other to hold vienna,1,True,-1,germany,russia,1,34,Fall,1906
would you be interested in visiting tyrolia its lovely this time of year,1,,2,germany,russia,1,35,Winter,1907
to be clear im offering to support that move if you agree with me that italy needs to be stopped,1,True,2,germany,russia,1,36,Winter,1907
quite likely üòÄ,1,True,-2,russia,germany,1,37,Winter,1907
well ill let you mull that over and add another suggestion  would you be willing to support one of gal or rum into bud from vie  also me and england are on the same page about one thing despite the seizure of sweden were not trying to invade your territory any further until italy is dealt with but we needed england to have a build in case italy made landfall on the british isle,1,True,2,germany,russia,1,38,Winter,1907
yeah i already preemptively cursed at him but noted i understood he needed the build    and yes ill happily support him to budapest if he ever fecking starts talking to me again he hasnt responded to me in more than two years,1,True,-2,russia,germany,1,39,Winter,1907
losing three dots changes a person theyll come around,1,True,2,germany,russia,1,40,Winter,1907
war changes you,1,True,-2,russia,germany,1,41,Winter,1907
operation flat tyr is a go,1,True,-2,russia,germany,1,42,Spring,1908
awesome any news from austria they‚Äôve not responded to me,1,True,2,germany,russia,1,43,Spring,1908
yeah hes gotten quite chatty with me this turn  i think were good and if you guys can contain italy youre probably in a good position to profit from the chaos,1,True,-2,russia,germany,1,44,Spring,1908
just letting you know that im on board with the 5way draw ive already submitted my orders and clicked adjudicate when all orders are submitted this has been a great game and introduction to diplomacy for me thanks for playing,1,True,2,germany,russia,1,45,Spring,1908
first game really  good job  and yes i have had the draw set since the start of this turn  just remember that in addition to the adjudicate when all orders are in you do need to select fiveway draw from the dropdown at the bottom of orders  it wont go through until its unanimous,1,True,-2,russia,germany,1,46,Spring,1908
got itthanks,1,True,2,germany,russia,1,47,Spring,1908
guten tag wanted to touch base about your plans for this year,1,True,0,england,germany,1,0,Spring,1901
your destruction mostly but plans can change,1,True,0,germany,england,1,1,Spring,1901
nobody makes it far without friends in this game i suppose youre hoping to be friends with france then,1,True,0,england,germany,1,2,Spring,1901
i dont consider it wise to put stock in any friendship until its proven however i tend to trust people more if they are willing to give me some information before asking it from me,1,True,0,germany,england,1,3,Spring,1901
well that makes two of us then youre welcome to ask a specific question if you have one though,1,True,0,england,germany,1,4,Spring,1901
alright then what are your plans for the north sea these days,1,,0,germany,england,1,5,Spring,1901
ill be moving there this spring just doing a pretty standard northern opening you taking the fleet to holland or denmark or somewhere else,1,True,0,england,germany,1,6,Spring,1901
my fleet is hollandbound pleasure doing business üòÉ,1,True,0,germany,england,1,7,Spring,1901
alright thanks for letting me know id also like to talk about me going to belgium i imagine this is something a bit less amenable to you but maybe something we could bargain over,1,True,0,england,germany,1,8,Spring,1901
well now the belgium discussion changes a bit france has this secured unless we collaborate in opposition also i can prevent your move to denmark,1,True,0,england,germany,1,9,Fall,1901
id be amenable to that to be clear would you want me to move my fleet to belgium while your north sea fleet supports,1,,0,germany,england,1,10,Fall,1901
so i could do this but to secure the move you would also have to cut the support from bur that france will likely give to move pic to bel you can just attack bur from mun to do this also providing this support is a bit of a favor and might put me at odds with france would you be willing to offer denmark to sweeten the deal for me,1,True,0,england,germany,1,11,Fall,1901
how can you take denmark while also supporting me from the north sea,1,True,0,germany,england,1,12,Fall,1901
oh im talking about next year should have clarified but this would require you keeping out this year,1,,0,england,germany,1,13,Fall,1901
im sorry but why why couldnt i hold it for this winter and then dip in the spring to let you in,1,True,0,germany,england,1,14,Fall,1901
id sooner keep denmark and let you be the one to occupy belgium if thats preferable ie support your north sea fleet moving there,1,True,0,germany,england,1,15,Fall,1901
the reason is because id need your support into denmark to be sure russia couldnt bump me out and its putting a lot of trust in you to expect youll just clear the way for me,1,True,0,england,germany,1,16,Fall,1901
well so what do you think of my counter offer then,1,True,0,germany,england,1,17,Fall,1901
i certainly appreciate it the only issue is that it still doesnt guarantee belgium for me france may support bur from pic instead and then it would be a bounce,1,True,0,england,germany,1,18,Fall,1901
i have it on admittedly italian authority that france is trying to make a play for munich from burgundy but even if that werent the case vacating burgundy would leave marseilles vulnerable to me so i think the only option for france that wouldnt be pyrrhic is to move from pic,1,True,0,germany,england,1,19,Fall,1901
thats fair at the least id like to keep france out of belgium even if i dont end up with it,1,False,0,england,germany,1,20,Fall,1901
also i had to look up pyrrhic haha,1,True,0,england,germany,1,21,Fall,1901
haha  so do we have a deal then ill attack burgundy while supporting your move to belgium and youll let me take denmark this turn,1,,0,germany,england,1,22,Fall,1901
yes we have a deal,1,True,0,england,germany,1,23,Fall,1901
your holland fleet supports nth to bel and i stay out of denmark this turn,1,True,0,england,germany,1,24,Fall,1901
you have a healthy sense of distrust and i respect that but i appreciate you not trying to keep me out of denmark nonetheless,1,True,1,germany,england,1,25,Winter,1901
also do you have thoughts on how we might collaborate next year what are your goals and what are your concerns,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,26,Winter,1901
you‚Äôre giving me too much credit i forgot to click submit on my order for the north sea or something was surprised myself to see a hold there so why did you back out of the deal then,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,27,Winter,1901
preferred to see france there,1,True,1,germany,england,1,28,Winter,1901
i can understand why you might have made that move but i think it‚Äôs actually bad for both of us even if you and france team up to knock me out france will get the better part of that deal and will then work with russia to take you down,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,29,Winter,1901
if i work with france we‚Äôll bring russia in on it who needs some help after what happened with turkey this looks good for all three of us and very bad for you,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,30,Winter,1901
the last option is for us to work together against france on the one hand this is a good move because france is a strong player in a strong position on the other hand how am i supposed to trust you at all to cooperate,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,31,Winter,1901
real talk i was given bad information that you and france were working together last round which does not seem to be the case but thats why i didnt follow through on our deal i am well positioned now to take belgium and i can see now that as you say it would be much easier on me to ally with you rather than try to take you down even with frances help but i can understand if you dont want to trust me,1,True,1,germany,england,1,32,Winter,1901
i was working with france and i still have a positive relationship with france we agreed to stay out of the english channel and france had agreed to support me into belgium but this was about hedging my bets not working against you and you see how that played out haha,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,33,Winter,1901
france would love for me to be an ally in taking you out of the game over the next couple of years they‚Äôve been talking about convincing russia to help with the takedown,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,34,Winter,1901
a joint stab against france would require a high level of collaboration on our end something like an agreement to essentially act as one country up until a certain year sharing all planned moves following up on them etc so this would be my condition for working together,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,35,Winter,1901
i would be willing to do that but as i see it you have no reason to choose france as an ally over me at this point so why me,1,True,1,germany,england,1,36,Winter,1901
choose me as an ally over france,1,True,1,germany,england,1,37,Winter,1901
so my reasoning is that i think france is a stronger player than either of us or at least a more engaged one im getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that if i help france france probably beats me if we defeat france together i think we each end up with an even fighting chance,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,38,Winter,1901
so basically france is too smart to be left alive and the world ought to belong to us idiots üòÇ,1,True,1,germany,england,1,39,Winter,1901
what about russia,1,True,1,germany,england,1,40,Winter,1901
haha yeah that was kind of my thinking russia is a little tied up in the south and so i dont expect aggression in the north however france would respond to a stab by begging for russian and potentially austrian and italian assistance so the choice next year is between containing russia or being aggressive which would mean going for sweden or st p i think the builds we see this winter will make it more clear whats possible,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,41,Winter,1901
speaking of what are your planned builds im building a fleet in london,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,42,Winter,1901
armies in kiel and munich,1,True,1,germany,england,1,43,Winter,1901
what are your plans for your north sea and london fleets  im trying to decide now how best to handle belgium and that is going to depend on whether france is concerned with defending brest or if instead they expect help from you in disrupting anything i try to do from holland   i can offer you support in moving into sweden in exchange for supporting my burgundy troops into belgium is that worth more than whatever france might be offering you right now,1,True,1,germany,england,1,44,Spring,1902
any thoughts on my offer i have another proposal if you‚Äôre interested,1,True,1,germany,england,1,45,Spring,1902
england youre killin me here,1,True,1,germany,england,1,46,Spring,1902
hey sorry busy evening for me let me think a second and respond to all this,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,47,Spring,1902
ok so for one thing france isnt exactly offering me anything so theres no real comparison of your offer vs theirs,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,48,Spring,1902
my once concern about the fullon france stab would be that the job couldnt be done quickly enough we could force bel this year but we unfortunately wouldnt be able to put france down a unit because spa is a guarantee for france this may even allow for a rebuild in bre if the belgian army gets dislodged,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,49,Spring,1902
thats where my new plan comes in,1,True,1,germany,england,1,50,Spring,1902
ok whats the sitch,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,51,Spring,1902
you move fleets to eng ska and nth this turn italy moves to pie i move holbel kieruh burgas munbur now france might foresee me attempting to take gas but more likely they want to dislodge me from bur this puts them in a position where they will have to lose one of paris belgium marseilles or brest and will not be able to vacate the others for building season,1,True,1,germany,england,1,52,Spring,1902
france could stop by bumping par and mar in gas right and youre suggesting my moves a setup of going against russia,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,53,Spring,1902
also have you talked to italy about this,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,54,Spring,1902
damni didnt think of the bumping sorry this is just my first game and im still learning and yeah i thought youd want to grab sweden because why not   i havent discussed the full plan but they seemed amenable to moving to pie,1,True,1,germany,england,1,55,Spring,1902
okay how about this,1,True,1,germany,england,1,56,Spring,1902
keep your fleets in nwg and nth but move to eng have nth support holbel  ill attack burpic move kieruh munbur if france does a gascon bounce theyll have to lose either brest or paris or marseilles if they try to dislodge me instead ill retreat to gascony  you still get my support to march on sweden in fall if desired,1,True,1,germany,england,1,57,Spring,1902
keep in mind that munich is vulnerable italy and austria may have a deal in the works for that but this is the sort of plan that i had thought through originally,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,58,Spring,1902
this would be a break of my dmz with france in the channel which is why the success of a stab like this is especially important,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,59,Spring,1902
well ya could have saved me some brain cells by sharing it in the first place üòõ   and italy and austria unless theyre lying think of me as an ally that said my plan doesnt actually involve vacating munich,1,True,1,germany,england,1,60,Spring,1902
oh fair because youre not actually moving into pic youre just cutting the support i had you moving from bur to bel dislodging the french army from bel could result in a disband and if we dont get an additional supply center could mean a rebuild in brest which would be bad for me adding spain is probably a given have you considered the potential support of mar from spa sc ,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,61,Spring,1902
yeah if my calculations are correct the french home supply centers hold first move is to bounce in gas to keep you out then move spain to sc and lose bel next move is to support hold in mar from spain sc and then bounce paris to brest to keep me out bre par and mar all hold in the fall,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,62,Spring,1902
ok marseilles might be a nogo this round then   if you dont want a rebuild in brest well simply attack picardy and force a retreat to brest by an army not so bad for your fleet right ill move into paris from bur,1,True,1,germany,england,1,63,Spring,1902
wait i mean a retreat to burgundy by that army then the parisian army will be in brest so no rebuild will occur,1,True,1,germany,england,1,64,Spring,1902
well it kind of becomes rock paper scissors there if i try to go into brest its a bounce and it remains open if i dont and france takes the risk of not going probably wont happen then it would stay open too,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,65,Spring,1902
sounds like youd like the belgian army to disband though i understand as it could help somebody out to take munich from ruh,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,66,Spring,1902
whoa dude i just want a supply center dont go talking about people invading the fatherland  so are you saying no deal then,1,True,1,germany,england,1,67,Spring,1902
no im just echoing your probable reasoning for wanting the disband of the belgian army rather than its retreat to ruh,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,68,Spring,1902
i dont see what that has to do with you though like what difference does it make to you whether that army disbands or retreats to ruh,1,True,1,germany,england,1,69,Spring,1902
the disband allows for a rebuild if theres an open home supply center and france still has 5 total so this could mean building a fleet in brest,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,70,Spring,1902
ohhh i see so what youre saying is youd accept the deal if i didnt arrange for the disband and allowed a retreat to ruh,1,True,1,germany,england,1,71,Spring,1902
let me sleep on it i may be fine regardless ill confirm moves in the morning but for this plan spring looks like your support into sweden and my support into belgium ill be very curious to see moves from russiaitalyaustria if they all converge in on you this could be trouble i doubt that level of collaboration is going to happen though,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,72,Spring,1902
hang on would you be willing to postpone your sweden march until fall im not so keen on forcing russia into the baltic,1,True,1,germany,england,1,73,Spring,1902
youd still hold sweden by winter,1,True,1,germany,england,1,74,Spring,1902
yeah that would be fair just need to run it by russia that norway is a hold in the spring so that doesn‚Äôt raise any eyebrows,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,75,Spring,1902
well or you could march into finland just to spice things up,1,True,1,germany,england,1,76,Spring,1902
well england youve taught me an important lesson,1,True,1,germany,england,1,77,Spring,1902
this isn‚Äôt a full stab i‚Äôm sorry for the deception though i hadn‚Äôt heard whether italy was antifrench now i have i‚Äôm taking denmark this year with russian support i‚Äôm sorry for that too kiel can‚Äôt save it i‚Äôd suggest you bounce kiel and munich in ruh and then attack holland from belgium to cut support  this will hold the line unless france decides to let you into belgium which would be unlikely,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,78,Fall,1902
i know you don‚Äôt want to take advice from me but you‚Äôre kind of in survival mode now we can talk about belgium for you next year to get you back on your feet,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,79,Fall,1902
england i have 00 reason to trust your advice regarding france youre so clearly working with them,1,True,1,germany,england,1,80,Fall,1902
i think the tactical suggestion stands on its own though you can work through the rules to verify it makes sense and should in case i‚Äôm making a mistake also i don‚Äôt know france‚Äôs moves this season and you should ping italy to talk about me,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,81,Fall,1902
nice i guess you knew what you were doing,1,True,1,england,germany,1,82,Winter,1902
well not reallyi just assumed that attacking a convoying fleet would disrupt the convoy and that was apparently wrong,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,83,Winter,1902
yeah you have to dislodge but you held ruhr and my way wouldn‚Äôt have worked actually that‚Äôs a stalemate line if you do the same moves except the fleet goes to belgium i think can only be broken if i support it of course france could choose to let you in to ruhr as well,1,True,1,england,germany,1,84,Winter,1902
hi not sure what you heard from italy looking forward to the three of us working against france though let me know where you‚Äôre at with this i‚Äôd help you into belgium this year,1,True,1,england,germany,1,85,Spring,1903
okay i‚Äôm down to cooperate,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,86,Spring,1903
ok all i need from you in the spring is to not attack nth then i‚Äôll support myself into the channel then i support you into belgium in the fall and i don‚Äôt touch holland kiel or berlin and russia doesn‚Äôt either maybe we get italy to move to pie,1,,1,england,germany,1,87,Spring,1903
hi i‚Äôm guessing the move to hel was to cut support should have let you know i was moving out are you still interested in collaboration for survival we‚Äôre both a bit threatened right now,1,True,1,england,germany,1,88,Fall,1903
hi‚Äîyeah because of bot troubles i never got reassured last turn that you wouldn‚Äôt support say france into belgium or something so now here we are france asked me to bump nth to cut your channel support just fyi,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,89,Fall,1903
to be clear i don‚Äôt intend to do that since i basically need everyone to fall back to keep my holdings this turn do you have any clue what russia‚Äôs plans are,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,90,Fall,1903
not sure what russia will do but i‚Äôd be a little concerned about berlin being surrounded i won‚Äôt be attacking kiel so your support will go through from there,1,True,1,england,germany,1,91,Fall,1903
does france think you‚Äôll be cutting support also italy has been sending some antifrench things my way a threeonone alliance could be good for all of us containing russia may distract both of us if he gets aggressive,1,True,1,england,germany,1,92,Fall,1903
i told france truthfully that i couldnt cut your support this turn,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,93,Fall,1903
cool do you need me to cut support in bal or do you have that covered with munich support,1,True,1,england,germany,1,94,Fall,1903
also italy is on board with a stab against france,1,True,1,england,germany,1,95,Fall,1903
italy told me that too and actually if i could count on you to cut bal support it would free up kiel to try and defend ruhr from france for a turn however if youre using that denmark fleet for something else just let me know,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,96,Fall,1903
so i have kind of a crazy idea im curious what youd think of this,1,True,1,england,germany,1,97,Fall,1903
what if i let you into denmark and i go for sweden,1,True,1,england,germany,1,98,Fall,1903
well if france goes for holland id be in a slightly strategically worse position,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,99,Fall,1903
i was thinking youd go from kiel and bounce holland with the hel fleet then you get your build in kiel,1,True,1,england,germany,1,100,Fall,1903
that wouldnt work because i need kiel to support berlin i think,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,101,Fall,1903
is munich occupied doing something else italy told me he has no plans of cutting support there,1,True,1,england,germany,1,102,Fall,1903
oh i guess bur can do that though,1,True,1,england,germany,1,103,Fall,1903
that was my fear,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,104,Fall,1903
hmm yeah it may be safe to not do that then maybe next year i may go for sweden regardless but if russia sees it coming and goes in that could be a bit annoying,1,True,1,england,germany,1,105,Fall,1903
but without action russia probably takes ank this fall and builds in stp,1,True,1,england,germany,1,106,Fall,1903
is it worth losing the channel this turn because you could take sweden for sure if you were willing to use nth to convoy,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,107,Fall,1903
nth cant convoy to sweden ska is in the way,1,True,1,england,germany,1,108,Fall,1903
doesnt need to just convoy to norway and move your fleet from norway to sweden then attack the baltic fleet from denmark that way you dont lose norway,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,109,Fall,1903
bal could move to sweden to bounce only way to guarantee would be to support from denmark,1,True,1,england,germany,1,110,Fall,1903
ah crap youre right sorry wish i could help but all i have are land troops,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,111,Fall,1903
no worries ill give it a shot regardless and if i do get the extra build i can provide some serious support to your moves west,1,True,1,england,germany,1,112,Fall,1903
things are getting a little rowdy haha the good news is that we both outlasted turkey,1,True,1,england,germany,1,113,Fall,1903
rip,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,114,Fall,1903
go team,1,True,1,england,germany,1,115,Fall,1903
you held the channel but no sweden yet,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,116,Fall,1903
yeah i think the bounce there will be a start of negotiations with russia clearly we were both on the same page,1,True,1,england,germany,1,117,Fall,1903
and you got holland back,1,True,1,england,germany,1,118,Fall,1903
ach but now theres french in ruhr thatll be a pain,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,119,Fall,1903
a bit france starts to crumble when i dont have to support my fleet anymore which is when italy forces france to go south with its mao fleet then i can start supporting your moves and we can get you into belgium etc,1,True,1,england,germany,1,120,Fall,1903
are you gonna try for sweden again this season france told me that theyre not moving their midatlantic fleet and instead would prefer to oust you from the channel   italy gave me the idea of supporting your welsh troops to convoy into belgium but if i did would you mind giving it to me in the fall i could be way more useful to you if i could build another unit this winter,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,121,Spring,1904
i told france id interrupt your support from nth in exchange for france letting me take belgium next round but at this point i almost dont think of belgium as being theirs to give hence id rather work with you,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,122,Spring,1904
russia and i plan to repeat the sweden bounce if thats to be trusted this frees up kiel and munich,1,True,1,england,germany,1,123,Spring,1904
im happy to give you belgium my idea of the split is you get bel and par i get bre and por and italy gets mar and spa obviously this wont all happen this year but you in bel makes sense longterm,1,True,1,england,germany,1,124,Spring,1904
the convoy makes me a bit nervous because if france goes to iri theyll get a home supply center in the fall,1,True,1,england,germany,1,125,Spring,1904
okay no convoy then   how do you feel about reneging with russia if you moved into the baltic instead of bouncing and i moved into denmark this is also insurance in case i cant end up with belgium this year i could support you into sweden in the fall,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,126,Spring,1904
id prefer to keep neutral with russia as fighting a war on two fronts would be a lot for me belgium isnt guaranteed for you this year but i think its likely france will have to respect the pressure in the south from italy this frees me up to cut support in pic and support you in from nth then you just have to cut support in ruh and bur if theres still something there in the fall,1,True,1,england,germany,1,127,Spring,1904
if france is honest with me ruhr will be free and bur will be occupied   lets be real here though russia has at most two units to spare to threaten you and likely not even that given the imminent pressure from austria im trying to work it out in the sandbox now but i really dont think theyd be an issue for you,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,128,Spring,1904
russia can support into norway once hes in sweden and nth wont be free to stop that,1,True,1,england,germany,1,129,Spring,1904
okay that checks out thanks for your patience  i was thinking of asking russia to support me into denmark this turn and offer to support them into sweden next season im doing this a to confirm for you that theyre on board with the bump as you say and b to show that id like to work to build trust with them however if russia already knows you and i are working together this will establish the opposite of trust so i guess im asking if you think this is a gooduseful idea and also asking what russia knows about our plans,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,130,Spring,1904
russia can only suspect that were working together at this point i havent given any indication of collaboration id say ask away,1,True,1,england,germany,1,131,Spring,1904
are you definitely committed to not cutting support in nth,1,True,1,england,germany,1,132,Spring,1904
i really really am maybe im just not creative enough but because of my alliance with italy who is in turn strongly allied with austria i just dont see myself ever getting anywhere in this game unless i can expand westward into france hence even though youre honestly scarier right now im inclined to be on your side for the foreseeable future  now you could just go copypaste this message to france and id be royally screwed so i hope that helps you believe you can trust me,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,133,Spring,1904
haha ok glad to get the confirmation on my end i‚Äôll confirm i am totally antifrench until france is out of the game i‚Äôve actually ceased communications with france maybe something we can all do once the stab is clear i‚Äôd like all three of us to get our two builds each together then we can look east,1,True,1,england,germany,1,134,Spring,1904
russias loyal to you even in the face of my temptation btw,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,135,Spring,1904
we‚Äôre in a great spot belgium for you is a guarantee planning to take from holland or ruhr,1,False,1,england,germany,1,136,Fall,1904
why do you ask i assumed you were going to disrupt support from picardy with a convoyed army while i disrupted burgundy that way you can still use nth to support the channel in case france decides not to bother defending in the south,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,137,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm a little worried that a clever france may let me into pic knowing that belgium is gone and then move into iri for invasion i‚Äôd almost rather cut pic with the channel and risk losing the channel and my favorite option is to support ruh to bel from nth also risking the channel the logic is that if i lose the channel it won‚Äôt be for very long but if i lose a home supply center that will be very annoying france seems pretty upset with me so a kamikaze move to screw me over isn‚Äôt out of the question,1,True,1,england,germany,1,138,Fall,1904
yeah im getting that vibe from france too lets go with moving me from ruhr,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,139,Fall,1904
sounds good consistent with that theory we‚Äôd advise italy to support into spain instead of mar it‚Äôs a tough call though,1,True,1,england,germany,1,140,Fall,1904
i mean not really the way italys positioned it seems like spain is the only right call and that marseilles will fall like a domino on a fault line next spring  unless we could confirm that france really doesnt intend to defend then italy could potentially swipe both in one swoop but even if france is saying such things to me and they are its still a risk,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,141,Fall,1904
marseilles isnt guaranteed to fall next spring suppose italy supports into spa france can block that supporting mao from gas suppose in the spring italy changes course and goes for mar france can then support bur to mar from gas unless im missing something its a guessing game until youre in bur,1,True,1,england,germany,1,142,Fall,1904
god dammit just when i think i get this game i‚Äôm still not clear on how the ‚Äòcoast‚Äô thing works with fleets,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,143,Fall,1904
do you think i could trust russia not to try to swipe munich if i tried to take bur this turn,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,144,Fall,1904
yeah the territory can only be occupied by one unit regardless of coast but a fleet must go to either the north or south coast mao can go to both the coast matters if say you want to go from spain to mar you can go there from the south coast but not the north coast and if you wanted to do this you could coordinate a bounce with the ber and tyr armies so russia cant sneak in youre planning to sneak into mun unsupported,1,True,1,england,germany,1,145,Fall,1904
sneak into bur,1,True,1,england,germany,1,146,Fall,1904
well at least to try for it i hadnt thought of bumping with italy because i assumed tyr would move into pie,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,147,Fall,1904
well your move only works if we let bur into mar which means italy doesnt try for mar which means pie would hold,1,True,1,england,germany,1,148,Fall,1904
oh i thought italy was trying for spa or rather wherever italy decides to go theres a chance it might work and then theyd want someone in pie,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,149,Fall,1904
well have to see which move italy wants to make if italy goes for spa the choice is between a hold or an attack from pie i would say a hold makes most sense for italy if youve decided youre going for bur this is because the alternative may be a bounce with bur and pie armies in mar that would foil your plan to get to bur and wouldnt give italy anything,1,True,1,england,germany,1,150,Fall,1904
okay that makes sense then,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,151,Fall,1904
as long as italy doesnt want to try to convoy into spain from pie then marseilles could be left open and tyrolia could potentially move into piedmont,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,152,Fall,1904
yeah that could be an idea well let me know when you hear from italy the good news is france will definitely be down one this year and maybe down two and our progress will continue next year at some point we should talk about postwar things,1,True,1,england,germany,1,153,Fall,1904
does postwar things mean how were going to deal with a seriously overpowered austriaitaly,1,True,-1,germany,england,1,154,Fall,1904
yeah though the move into trieste by italy is interesting im actually starting to worry about collaboration with france would italy really be so greedy as to start a war on two fronts also had you asked for a hold in pie not that it would have changed the outcome,1,True,0,england,germany,1,155,Winter,1904
i asked but italy told me that they couldn‚Äôt guarantee they would or wouldn‚Äôt and i can understand wanting to keep that info needtoknow but what makes you think italy and france would collaborate also i‚Äôm not so sure you should read that seizing of trieste as an act of war italy did help austria take two supply centers this turn austria might have given it willingly,1,True,0,germany,england,1,156,Winter,1904
would or wouldn‚Äôt hold pie,1,True,0,germany,england,1,157,Winter,1904
austria expressed frustration to me about it also austria cant build all of its home supply centers are occupied and italy only helped with one supply center right and yeah the france theory may be a little paranoid but why would italy make an enemy out of austria now while occupied with france,1,True,0,england,germany,1,158,Winter,1904
what are your thoughts on the france campaign for this year,1,True,0,england,germany,1,159,Winter,1904
also italy and austria‚Äôs stories about trieste don‚Äôt line up italy says it was an offering,1,True,0,england,germany,1,160,Winter,1904
right thats what italy told me too so im not sure can i confront italy with what austria told you  i will be moving kieruh for sure we can halfheartedly attack pic this spring if you want ill move belpic you support though i doubt well get anywhere with it munich will support kieruh and fall ill do a threesided assault on bur  none of this is very exciting though  if italy cant make headway well probably be stuck in a holding pattern until you can shift some resources from the baltic,1,True,0,germany,england,1,161,Winter,1904
actually i got italy on board to coordinate with us to leave one of marseilles or spain open for france to fall into if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous you could try for mao or if not i‚Äôll try for bur let me know which you prefer and we‚Äôll talk plans,1,True,0,germany,england,1,162,Winter,1904
italy is now saying that he told a secret that austria didnt want him to tell and that i shouldnt tell austria that i know that trieste was arranged sigh,1,True,0,england,germany,1,163,Winter,1904
ill get back to you on mao likely i wont but maybe with very friendly russian disbands trying for bur makes sense,1,True,0,england,germany,1,164,Winter,1904
well you couldnt ask for friendlier disbands than that what do you think about making a play for mao what if i could get italy onboard to support you in from wes,1,True,0,germany,england,1,165,Spring,1905
also im wondering what your thoughts are on taking russias northern holdings  on the one hand its more power for you but on the other weakening russia is pretty much the same as feeding austria,1,True,0,germany,england,1,166,Spring,1905
im nervous about mao because id really like to keep holding the channel yeah i need to decide what to do with russia its really tempting to scoop up some supply centers but that would be the end of russia,1,True,0,england,germany,1,167,Spring,1905
in other news france who continues to message in spite of my ghosting just pointed out that italy has a number 1 ranking on playdiplomacycom the username checks out but thats about as far as i can verify,1,True,0,england,germany,1,168,Spring,1905
right france told me too so it may be worth reconsidering our deal with the devil,1,True,0,germany,england,1,169,Spring,1905
i think france may still have to go though we cant be both allied with france geographically it doesnt really make sense however me you and russia vs austria and italy might work well for us,1,True,0,england,germany,1,170,Spring,1905
i think so too but realistically as things stand now you me and russia v italyaustria just looks like me and russia getting shtkicked while you hang out in the back so the question ought to be can we afford to take down france before ia get too powerful or is it worth it to put aside eating france to nip this in the bud,1,True,0,germany,england,1,171,Spring,1905
russias actually in a really good position if i choose not to invade id have to go over the tactics but im pretty sure that line will hold in the south,1,True,0,england,germany,1,172,Spring,1905
and then you can support mun from kiel,1,True,0,england,germany,1,173,Spring,1905
when the time comes,1,True,0,england,germany,1,174,Spring,1905
i can bring my fleets around this year to support the attack on france and that would put us in good position to face italy but wed have to play it off as just going for france until france is gone,1,True,0,england,germany,1,175,Spring,1905
but i thought you said you werent gonna go for mao,1,True,0,germany,england,1,176,Spring,1905
i wont try from the channel but i can bring the nwy fleet around this year,1,True,0,england,germany,1,177,Spring,1905
why the fleet in berlin btw,1,True,0,england,germany,1,178,Spring,1905
well i figured that id need at least one more eventually and that since my whole northern border is coastal a fleet might be better for defending that but itll be all armies after this i think,1,True,0,germany,england,1,179,Spring,1905
that makes sense though it does seem like it will be stuck there for a while unless you start coming for me and russia,1,True,0,england,germany,1,180,Spring,1905
well at some point well all turn on each other i assume but i dont see that happening for a while not til france italy and austria are dealt with,1,True,0,germany,england,1,181,Spring,1905
we can always play to a three way draw so does this mean you would be committed to a russiagermanyengland alliance until the others are dealt with,1,True,0,england,germany,1,182,Spring,1905
and to a point you made a few messages ago about me hanging in the back dealing with italy is going to take a lot from me hes got the fleets that only i can deal with,1,True,0,england,germany,1,183,Spring,1905
yes thats what this means however italy and france are both pretty talkative with me these days which could be useful for us so dont go spreading it around that my true allegiance right now is to you and russia   and speaking of fleet things if youre not doing anything with nth this turn anyway could you help me out by supporting holbel i think it makes sense for me to have a fleet with channel access in case you ever need support or a bounce there to keep france out maybe some sunny day youd even trust me to hold it for you though i understand if not,1,True,0,germany,england,1,184,Spring,1905
what sorts of things are you hearing from italy and france also are you talking to russia im planning to support the channel with nth,1,True,0,england,germany,1,185,Spring,1905
i just messaged russia i told them about your suggestion of a threeway alliance and that i was mainly focussed on attacking the west this year but if needed i could readjust to spare somebody to support in the east  i havent heard back from france yet but i am sort of playing doubleagent with italy to ensure that france can continue countering italys spamar plays and it just looks like luck this keeps italy in check until you and i make progress in the north and are better positioned to push italy back  i should have mentioned but a third reason for the fleet build last turn was to keep frances trust i figured it made sense anyway for the other two reasons i mentioned but i did want to make sure france is willing to listen to me about italy,1,True,0,germany,england,1,186,Spring,1905
interesting that italy was willing to give up his guess to you i had considered the idea of feeding france info like this but he wouldnt have believed anything i told him and yeah it makes sense that something else was going on with the fleet situation,1,True,0,england,germany,1,187,Spring,1905
what moves do you have planned westward,1,True,0,england,germany,1,188,Spring,1905
italy was willing to give up their guess because i requested that marseilles be left open so i could take bur which i plan to attempt w munich this turn and italy agreed,1,True,0,germany,england,1,189,Spring,1905
did italy explain why he didnt keep his end of the deal cause he moved to mar,1,True,0,england,germany,1,190,Spring,1905
no i mean this turn,1,True,0,germany,england,1,191,Spring,1905
ah ok cause we had talked about it last turn as well,1,True,0,england,germany,1,192,Spring,1905
last turn they didnt give me anything useful,1,True,0,germany,england,1,193,Spring,1905
gotcha italy had asked me for support into mao which would not be consistent with that though,1,True,0,england,germany,1,194,Spring,1905
i did say no or rather havent said yes im curious about the timing though,1,True,0,england,germany,1,195,Spring,1905
today at 511 pm italy said to me if i leave marseilles open would you kindly use burgundy in the fall to help me take marseilles likely that means ordering burgundy to gascony to cut support so it could be that both are true and italy plans to do neitherrather than try to take spa italys gonna try rearranging,1,True,0,germany,england,1,196,Spring,1905
511 central time,1,True,0,germany,england,1,197,Spring,1905
ok at 608 pm est italy asked about mao so thats around the same time im not going to support mao and told italy as much,1,True,0,england,germany,1,198,Spring,1905
france would probably just cut in bre anyways,1,True,0,england,germany,1,199,Spring,1905
was that the reasoning you gave for not supporting,1,True,0,germany,england,1,200,Spring,1905
just that it wouldnt be fruitful because france would cut support i also said that i was eyeing it for next year which will be obvious from my upcoming move of the nwy fleet,1,True,0,england,germany,1,201,Spring,1905
alright well sounds like we resolved that little mystery statecraft is exhausting,1,True,0,germany,england,1,202,Spring,1905
haha yeah i dont know if i would do online diplomacy again ive only done it in person ive spent wayy too much time thinking about this game but its alson been fun,1,True,0,england,germany,1,203,Spring,1905
im prepping for an august inperson game i have scheduled with some friends,1,True,0,england,germany,1,204,Spring,1905
i have also been spending way too much time thinking about this yeah the days between adjudications are just too much,1,True,0,germany,england,1,205,Spring,1905
i agree in person is exhausting for other reasons though you have to take a whole day out and it‚Äôs much more stressful when you have 15 minute negotiations and everyone is in the same house,1,True,0,england,germany,1,206,Spring,1905
oh i didnt even think of the logistics of in person negotiating so if you and russia disappear for five minutes everybody knows somethings up,1,True,0,germany,england,1,207,Spring,1905
yeah and also you see little cliques start to form like three countries will get together and then go quiet when someone else walks in the room and you can just shout stuff to the room if you want also tactical and order errors are more common and intentional order errors are a thing,1,True,0,england,germany,1,208,Spring,1905
that sounds like a perfect storm of social and tacticalanxiety inducing stimuli i think the ideal thing from my perspective would be online play with three adjudications per day so its about the same level of commitment as a really active group chat,1,True,0,germany,england,1,209,Spring,1905
yeah people get pretty emotional and i do it with a group of friends too we decided we could only handle it once every 6 months or so,1,True,0,england,germany,1,210,Spring,1905
three times a day would be too much for me i think i feel like i wouldnt get any work done,1,True,0,england,germany,1,211,Spring,1905
i could see that but sacrifices have to be made,1,True,0,germany,england,1,212,Spring,1905
haha im not a multitasker so id bet the sacrifice is bigger for me than it is for you also i feel like it would be easier almost if i wasnt on the computer all day for work as it was but having work and recreation competing for the same screen is really distracting for me,1,True,0,england,germany,1,213,Spring,1905
you just described me and my situation but i take summers as pseudovacation so theres not as much consequence,1,True,0,germany,england,1,214,Spring,1905
yeah thats not a bad way to do it im a grad student in the same schooldepartment as admin actually so ive also got a pseudovacation not taking classes or anything but im still trying to be productive,1,True,0,england,germany,1,215,Spring,1905
im in admins department too i should have realized only grad students feel as guilty about spending time doing things they enjoy as you seem to üòõ  but back to business any chance of letting me borrow denmark i figure that with northern russia out of the picture your fleets just sort ofparked there but if you let me have it i will either build an army in ber to help out russia or an army in kiel to fight france with i totally understand if you dont want to though,1,True,0,germany,england,1,216,Fall,1905
anyway regardless of how you feel about the denmark issue i just hatched a plan to potentially help france keep resisting italy if youre game  tell italy youve had a change of heart and want to support them into mao this turn on the condition that they free it up for you by moving to portugal next spring  if italy agrees let me know ill tell france to put all power into defending marseilles and mao   the hope is that since last turn i was the one who knew italys move and this timeas far as italy knowsonly youll know it italy wont smell a rat when france is lucky in defending again,1,True,0,germany,england,1,217,Fall,1905
no way i wonder if weve been walking past each other in iribe and without any idea that were both in the study and lets bring up denmark again when i have another build secured who knows how long it will take to get into brest,1,True,0,england,germany,1,218,Fall,1905
thats a reasonable plan for italy let me get a sense of where italys head is at first he may not even want mao anymore,1,True,0,england,germany,1,219,Fall,1905
can you explain the fleet move btw,1,True,0,england,germany,1,220,Fall,1905
honestly because i thought you‚Äôd say yes to giving me denmark i doubt we‚Äôve run into each other because i‚Äôm in st louis for the summer,1,True,0,germany,england,1,221,Fall,1905
yeah we should have talked about that  before probably on its own the move has a somewhat antime connotation and yeah i definitely have not been to st louis this summer haha,1,True,0,england,germany,1,222,Fall,1905
youre going for bur this season,1,,0,england,germany,1,223,Fall,1905
sorry to spook you and not to beat a dead horse but you claim you want to secure another build but with your denmark fleet basically stuck where it is it‚Äôs not like keeping it is going to help you with that goal that supply center‚Äôs doing nothing for you except maintaining the unit bound to it i on the other hand could help you get what you want by getting another build  if you have plans to use the denmark fleet i‚Äôll respect them because right now our goals are the same but i see no point in keeping the fleet just for its own sake  yep going for bur,1,True,0,germany,england,1,224,Fall,1905
yeah i mean its a bargaining chip russia has to be in my good graces while i have it and its something i could offer you in exchange for something nice its not clear to me why you need it right now paris has your name on it youll win the eventual for mar with no trouble,1,True,0,england,germany,1,225,Fall,1905
alright that‚Äôs a valid reason i was feeling more urgent about it because i think it‚Äôs paramount that russia get some aid against austria,1,True,0,germany,england,1,226,Fall,1905
yeah thats fair i think russia is clever enough to reinstate the stalemate though maybe ill drop him a line to see what hes thinking,1,True,0,england,germany,1,227,Fall,1905
btw italy plans to literally randomize his move choice,1,True,0,england,germany,1,228,Fall,1905
thanks for letting me know,1,True,0,germany,england,1,229,Fall,1905
nice job on bur lets see if we can get you paris next year,1,True,0,england,germany,1,230,Fall,1905
whats your plan for taking mao if you want to move engiri i will support nth into the channel,1,True,0,germany,england,1,231,Spring,1906
yeah i was thinking the same actually only risk is a bump in iri i think results in dislodge of the current channel unit i‚Äôm willing to risk it though france at this point is likely trying to choose who to annoy the most as he goes down i have a feeling it will be me even though i‚Äôm not the one taking his territories so far i‚Äôll probably go another year without a build unfortunately,1,True,0,england,germany,1,232,Spring,1906
patience my teasipping friend üòõ  but if you dislodge trying to get iri that means you at least got nao and putting the unit in pic would help you take brest anyway,1,True,0,germany,england,1,233,Spring,1906
oh i‚Äôm planning nwg to nth so that i‚Äôm still in nth do you think the brest fleet may move to pic,1,True,0,england,germany,1,234,Spring,1906
ya know if youd just let me have denmark back you could keep nth and get at least one of naoiribrest this year i can keep talking to france to see where their heads at but i think a move to pic is probably not in the cards if you were to predict it franced lose brest,1,True,0,germany,england,1,235,Spring,1906
are you still on good terms with france was the move into bur expected,1,True,0,england,germany,1,236,Spring,1906
it was actually france has seen the end coming for a while but since i was willing to work with them against italy while you two ghosted theyre more amenable to my invasion that yours or italys,1,True,0,germany,england,1,237,Spring,1906
makes sense well let me think about whether denmark is a possibility though i‚Äôm still very hesitant and get back to you and i let me know what france is up to with brest,1,True,0,england,germany,1,238,Spring,1906
alternatively why not just leave nth empty for a turn  im working on figuring out france as we speak,1,True,0,germany,england,1,239,Spring,1906
cool and i suppose i could though it does leave me a little vulnerable maybe we could talk a bit about what our collaboration looks like over the next couple of years,1,True,0,england,germany,1,240,Spring,1906
well i can say definitively at this point that france prefers to mess with italy over you basically they dont want to see italy totally dominate this game i encouraged this by saying that italys going to try for mao this turn and they should focus on defending that   wrt the next couple years my idea is this its crucial that you take mao and that i take paris from here you and i can work on beating italy out of the iberian such that you end up with portugal marseilles and spain and i end up with brest and paris though you can have brest at first from here were well positioned to start hitting italy on their home turf esp if russia can keep hammering away at austria,1,False,0,germany,england,1,241,Spring,1906
any thoughts on this,1,True,0,germany,england,1,242,Spring,1906
that all makes sense thought im a bit surprised that youd rather have brest than mar whats the reasoning for that preference and how long would you let me hold onto brest,1,True,0,england,germany,1,243,Spring,1906
i figured this split would give you land and sea options for attacking italy and not for attacking me but i was just spitballing and it may make more sense to divide it your wayand you could hold brest until we were the only two in all of france and spain i suppose,1,True,0,germany,england,1,244,Spring,1906
have you made a decision yet about what to do about nth,1,True,0,germany,england,1,245,Spring,1906
i prefer to do the same moves as last time so nth would be a hold i dont think mao is going to iri or nao but you would have the inside scoop,1,True,0,england,germany,1,246,Spring,1906
what would you do with bel if it was freed up,1,True,0,england,germany,1,247,Spring,1906
wait when you say nth is a hold do you mean you dont want to try for iri like we talked about and youre just holding the channel,1,True,0,germany,england,1,248,Spring,1906
that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm thinking now yes,1,True,0,england,germany,1,249,Spring,1906
just holding the channel and convoying to brest  and if by it in what would you do with bel if it was freed up you mean nth then probably move it to pic in case france tries to bounce me out of paris but it might make more sense for you to just convoy to pic in which case bel could support you into pic,1,True,0,germany,england,1,250,Spring,1906
oh nevermind you mean what would you do with bel if bel wasnt supporting nth well my answer still applies,1,True,0,germany,england,1,251,Spring,1906
would you like me to support your army into pic,1,True,0,germany,england,1,252,Spring,1906
that army isn‚Äôt leaving the island until france‚Äôs fate is sealed otherwise i open up my home centers to france,1,True,0,england,germany,1,253,Spring,1906
but you did convoy to brest last time was that just because you were sure the army would bounce   so then basically everyones holding still except youre poking nao,1,True,0,germany,england,1,254,Spring,1906
yeah that‚Äôs my plan the convoy was because if it worked i could just build on the island and be fine but i‚Äôm taking on a risk if i can‚Äôt guarantee the build,1,True,0,england,germany,1,255,Spring,1906
ohh gotcha im moving burpar ruhbur everyone else is just staying put,1,False,0,germany,england,1,256,Spring,1906
i really am curious about your relationship with france btw italy mentioned that you asked him recently whether collaboration with france was ok but what could that mean unless it was against me,1,True,0,england,germany,1,257,Spring,1906
üôÑ italy said that you were plotting against me too theyre just trying to make us suspicious of each other,0,True,0,germany,england,1,258,Spring,1906
so you‚Äôre saying italy lied to me i‚Äôm gonna make you click that thumbs down if you‚Äôre trying to fool me here,1,True,0,england,germany,1,259,Spring,1906
well no its true that i asked italy about collaborating with france but only because france wanted us all to be able to talk about its last will and testament together i didnt bother asking you because you had been pretty clear on ghosting france but i wasnt sure whether italy was or not til i asked,0,True,0,germany,england,1,260,Spring,1906
but its very possible that italy took this fact and warped it to make you suspicious of me,1,True,0,germany,england,1,261,Spring,1906
so while were at it is there anything you might have said to italy to indicate you were planning to turn on me,1,True,0,germany,england,1,262,Spring,1906
well i‚Äôm glad i asked the follow up question did italy agree to being part of this discussion and how did the discussion turn out is france going to take out his anger on me with a final stab are you going to help him and yeah i‚Äôve absolutely been talking up antigerman things to italy i want him to be confident in where i stand so he doesn‚Äôt expect a stab,1,True,0,england,germany,1,263,Spring,1906
oh italy said i dont trust france and that was the end of it so no there didnt end up being a discussion except me telling france that youre gunning for brest which was obvious anyway and that italys shooting for mao this turn which may or may not be truebut by this time you and i were strategizing and i wanted to keep france out of our way  if france is planning to stab you theyre intentionally throwing me off the scent which would be surprising but not unheard of so no im not planning to help in a stab i know nothing about,0,True,0,germany,england,1,264,Spring,1906
well to be clear another consequence of my and frances conversation was that france is just letting me walk into paris this turn unless theyre gonna stab me but i doubt it,1,True,0,germany,england,1,265,Spring,1906
yeah i believe that so i guess it‚Äôs just giving italy a hard time then or maybe some unexpected movement north has italy talked to you about attacking me,1,True,0,england,germany,1,266,Spring,1906
postfrance,1,True,0,england,germany,1,267,Spring,1906
well yeah in the same convo where they said you were plotting to stab me they gave some reasons why its better for me to side with them than with you so no specifics but italy clearly wants us against each other but i dont think either of us stand a chance if we fall for that,1,True,0,germany,england,1,268,Spring,1906
no specific attacks were suggested i mean,1,True,0,germany,england,1,269,Spring,1906
gotcha well i think we have to acknowledge that our alliance would be sort of geographically awkward i think that makes the alliance stronger actually but we should be honest with each other about an exit that gives each of us a fair shot in the endgame,1,True,0,england,germany,1,270,Spring,1906
okaywell as the person who has ever seen an endgame before what do you suggest,1,True,0,germany,england,1,271,Spring,1906
i think we agree to coordinated actions until italy is dealt with i think you in brest is actually more fair although less ideal for me i think we need to pick a victor of the russianaustrian war austria is an easier pick because i can take russian dots and austria can help with italy,1,True,0,england,germany,1,272,Spring,1906
alright but it will be harder to flip austria against italy i think,1,True,0,germany,england,1,273,Spring,1906
nah i‚Äôve been working on it a bit and it‚Äôs only natural once his current conflict is mitigated somewhat,1,True,0,england,germany,1,274,Spring,1906
i think between us we should find a split of dots we feel comfortable with not that it can‚Äôt change in future negotiations but i think it‚Äôs easier to stay friends when the end seems fair from the getgo,1,True,0,england,germany,1,275,Spring,1906
we don‚Äôt have to do this tonight but soon,1,True,0,england,germany,1,276,Spring,1906
okay soon glad we had this talk üòÉ,1,True,0,germany,england,1,277,Spring,1906
fwiw i‚Äôm a relative firsttimer too i‚Äôve played two or three times in person and the first time we didn‚Äôt finish i think everyone else plays a lot more would be nice to make this an underdog story,1,True,0,england,germany,1,278,Spring,1906
regardless of which way it falls in the end,1,True,0,england,germany,1,279,Spring,1906
i think so too and italy is like the overest of dogs,1,True,0,germany,england,1,280,Spring,1906
you lost me haha the overest of dogs,1,True,0,england,germany,1,281,Spring,1906
like the opposite of underdog would be overdog and italy is the most overest overdog there is,1,True,0,germany,england,1,282,Spring,1906
the overwolf perhaps,1,,0,germany,england,1,283,Spring,1906
haha gotcha do we think he‚Äôs actually the number 1 guy like france said he denied it to me but the username lines up,1,True,0,england,germany,1,284,Spring,1906
i think its more probable than not although i also think its really unfair to have that information leaked when other players get the benefit of a clean slate that said just looking at the way italy moves and talks its clear that they know what theyre doing,1,True,0,germany,england,1,285,Spring,1906
yeah he‚Äôs definitely a good player all the better when we take him down,1,True,0,england,germany,1,286,Spring,1906
ugh i really wish everyoned stop using he all the time france and italy know each other from outside this game but it irks me that he seems to be the default out of curiosity do youothers use she when referring to me,1,,0,germany,england,1,287,Spring,1906
i had been using ‚Äúthey‚Äù but then i stopped once i saw other people using gendered pronouns my rationalization was that the other players must have been confident in their correctness to start using them but obviously that‚Äôs not true we use ‚Äúshe‚Äù for you france said it to me first i think happy to commit to being gender neutral in future negotiations with all players,1,True,0,england,germany,1,288,Spring,1906
i didn‚Äôt mean to be directive‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt matter that much to me but it makes me feel better if i know people aren‚Äôt just doing it mindlessly and are actually matching it to players they know i never specified to france that i use ‚Äúshe‚Äù but my username is feminine so it was a fair assumption,1,True,0,germany,england,1,289,Spring,1906
yeah that‚Äôs totally fair i will admit i had floated the idea of trying to play feminine and flirt with one of the probably straight male players to gain favor the username‚Äôs a giveaway though and that might be taking things too far haha,1,True,0,england,germany,1,290,Spring,1906
that can‚Äôt possibly actually work can it the flirting i mean this is a serious game for seriousminded individuals üòõ,1,True,0,germany,england,1,291,Spring,1906
‚Äù she writes before adding a playful emoji at the end,1,True,0,england,germany,1,292,Spring,1906
all‚Äôs fair in love war and diplomacy üòâ,1,True,0,england,germany,1,293,Spring,1906
ouch still open to collaboration but we‚Äôve got some trust building to do,1,True,0,england,germany,1,294,Spring,1906
i wasnt sensing any trust from you either you were unwilling to return denmark or to leave nth empty and youre right about our alliance being geographically awkward   i want to be a good ally with you but the difference between you and me is that you get a cozy corner of the map and im right in the middle i need to be able to grow my army to defend all my various borders so im asking for denmark a little less politely,1,True,0,germany,england,1,295,Fall,1906
well now youve seen me make exactly the moves that i said i would so hopefully you have some trust in me i see what you mean about the cozy corner but coziness has its disadvantages as well once somebody gets on the island its a really bad time and i need fleets or convoys of armies to get anywhere off the island makes expansion difficult,1,True,0,england,germany,1,296,Fall,1906
as far as denmark the aggression there is fair but you understand why im hesitant to drop down to 4 dots at this point in the game fortunately theres an opportunity to do business here now that youre adjacent to brest,1,True,0,england,germany,1,297,Fall,1906
im definitely a bit upset about the support into the channel you gave and all of the lying you didnt need to lie about your moves to amp up the aggression on denmark i never asked for a full list of moves,1,True,0,england,germany,1,298,Fall,1906
thats true i was overcompensating because it really seemed like your trust in me was low,1,True,0,germany,england,1,299,Fall,1906
well its a vicious cycle mistrust breeds mistrust so how can i trust now that youre not just going to continue working with france on an invasion,1,True,0,england,germany,1,300,Fall,1906
because france is literally about to not exist for one and for another because italy is planning something that will be bad for both of us,1,True,0,germany,england,1,301,Fall,1906
planning something specific that you know about,1,True,0,england,germany,1,302,Fall,1906
yes but i was told specifically not to tell you so i need you to not mention it to any other players i know thats a hard sell coming from me but i need you to promise,1,True,0,germany,england,1,303,Fall,1906
alright it‚Äôs a promise who‚Äôs the info from,1,True,0,england,germany,1,304,Fall,1906
doubly confirmed by france and italy theyve reached an agreement to give italy the channel when i confronted italy about it italy said they wouldnt do it if i didnt want them to but also admitted that they wouldnt have told me about it if i hadnt asked,1,True,0,germany,england,1,305,Fall,1906
but france also told me they would reneg on italy if i asked so on the one hand i could tell italy to call it off and things could proceed some unknown way on the other i could get france to reneg and the three of us could turn this to our advantage what do you think,1,True,0,germany,england,1,306,Fall,1906
it‚Äôs certainly possible this is true though italy had told me he was actively deceiving france into getting the brest unit to do something unusual,1,True,0,england,germany,1,307,Fall,1906
so if italy is truly going for the channel he went so far as to cover his tracks by warning me he may have suggested something like this to france,1,True,0,england,germany,1,308,Fall,1906
to what extent has italy communicated plans of an alliance with you,1,True,0,england,germany,1,309,Fall,1906
i mean that doesnt seem out of the question for italy italy has told me point blank that if its a choice between you or me theyd choose me im sure theyve said the same to you,1,True,0,germany,england,1,310,Fall,1906
did he give any reasoning for that choice,1,True,0,england,germany,1,311,Fall,1906
some bull about how im an honest communicator that raised a red flag for me because italys too smart to need honesty from me youre the better strategic choice   so its entirely possible that italy fed me this plot through france as some kind of ploy and even that the two of you are already working closely together to ruin me although i do hope thats not the case,1,True,0,germany,england,1,312,Fall,1906
i agree with all that i‚Äôm just trying to tease out who he‚Äôs lying to as that may provide some advantage honestly he‚Äôs been more proenglish than antigerman in his communications with me i think he maybe just doesn‚Äôt want me to go tattle to you though,1,True,0,england,germany,1,313,Fall,1906
so what moves would you want to see from me this fall,1,True,0,england,germany,1,314,Fall,1906
ill tell italy the deal is off then you move dennth ntheng supported by bel engbre supported by paris mao will take portugal and youll take mao i know youll have to trust my support in two places but its worth it to me to get two builds this turn  without a fuss and keep italy localized to the south,1,True,0,germany,england,1,315,Fall,1906
did italy tell you mao would take portugal,1,True,0,england,germany,1,316,Fall,1906
no i havent given them my opinion on the channel deal yet but that would be what id suggest they do instead,1,False,0,germany,england,1,317,Fall,1906
alright would you be able to confirm that this is where mao would go before i agree to a deal,1,True,0,england,germany,1,318,Fall,1906
i just sent italy a message about it so ill see what they say,0,True,0,germany,england,1,319,Fall,1906
what has italy been saying to you lately by the way,1,True,0,germany,england,1,320,Fall,1906
he suggested some defensive tactics to me,1,True,0,england,germany,1,321,Fall,1906
defensives against me in denmark or france in iri or both,1,True,0,germany,england,1,322,Fall,1906
both he‚Äôs under the impression that we are not friendly after those last moves i don‚Äôt plan to take his suggestion though,1,True,0,england,germany,1,323,Fall,1906
im wondering if these defenses involve you not supporting eng which would kind of halfconfirm the plot,1,True,0,germany,england,1,324,Fall,1906
they do involve me not supporting eng,1,True,0,england,germany,1,325,Fall,1906
italy said they are busy this weekend hard for me to imagine people having a life but it must be so and wont get back to me til monday,1,True,0,germany,england,1,326,Fall,1906
gotcha i‚Äôm playin dnd this weekend but i‚Äôm not sure that quite counts as having a life i‚Äôll probably be mostly offline through sunday evening just cause i really need a break from this game,1,True,0,england,germany,1,327,Fall,1906
umm the plan doesnt work btw gas is just going to cut the par support that you promised me this is the only useful thing it can do so no deal unfortunately ill see if i can get last minute support in from italy and let you know,1,True,0,england,germany,1,328,Fall,1906
i really dont think an attack from gascony would be an issue but i understand that your trust in france is much lower than mine we could still work together somehow though,1,False,0,germany,england,1,329,Fall,1906
in a tactical sense anything else from gascony would be a misfire so not cutting the paris support is just giving up brest i really dont think france is just going to hand brest to me im still waiting to see if i can get italian support in which case were back in business the alternative would be a more defensive move on my part i really dont want to go down to 4 dots at this phase in the game,1,True,0,england,germany,1,330,Fall,1906
ok hope youll see this before noon italy has agreed to support into bre i also require par support for this to go through do you agree to provide par supports channel to bre and bel supports nth to channel i will vacate denmark if so,1,True,0,england,germany,1,331,Fall,1906
ok well if i dont hear from you in the next couple of minutes i wont assume the support and will play defensive,1,True,0,england,germany,1,332,Fall,1906
sorry im trying to get verification from italy but theyre not responding thats a good default plan,1,True,0,germany,england,1,333,Fall,1906
i dont think youre going to get verification from italy italy is online and talking to me though,1,True,0,england,germany,1,334,Fall,1906
ok do i have your supports,1,True,0,england,germany,1,335,Fall,1906
yes,1,True,0,germany,england,1,336,Fall,1906
deal on,1,True,0,germany,england,1,337,Fall,1906
yep denmark going to nth,1,True,0,england,germany,1,338,Fall,1906
got italy confirmationhope this goes through,1,True,0,germany,england,1,339,Fall,1906
drum roll,1,True,0,england,germany,1,340,Fall,1906
yay,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,341,Winter,1906
wow an 11thhour threepower deal with a decieved france as a fourth that actually went through as planned,1,True,2,germany,england,1,342,Winter,1906
yeah and although we had our hiccups this was really about as good as we could have hoped the takedown to be from the beginning,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,343,Winter,1906
do you think theres a chance italy would give you mao willingly this turn,1,True,2,germany,england,1,344,Spring,1907
theres a chance im surprised by the fleet build btw,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,345,Spring,1907
my plan is to eventually have only fleets along my northwest coast theyre more versatile in that context and move the armies inland   see what you can negotiate with italy but no matter what they say id be prepared to use your full strength to get nao into mao if thats what you want to do and in case its not obvious its what i think you should do,1,True,2,germany,england,1,346,Spring,1907
to that end i can support eng  and bre holding,1,True,2,germany,england,1,347,Spring,1907
i appreciate the supports any idea what trouble france will be trying to cause,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,348,Spring,1907
i imagine youll get a request about bre,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,349,Spring,1907
france and italy are probably not working together after last years stab but france has asked me if theres anything i want pic to help with so depending on your plans i may be able to push some help your way i feel like italys 10 units kind of speak for themselves so even though you and f have had your differences theres a good chance f will want to help youus as the underdogs,0,True,2,germany,england,1,350,Spring,1907
yeah i mean this turn i dont know what pic does to help me antiitalian moves are mao as youve described what are your thoughts on supporting bre to gas from par this would require a lot of trust from you but would make supporting into spa possible in the fall,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,351,Spring,1907
does that mean youd convoy into bre because i can ask france to support that,1,True,2,germany,england,1,352,Spring,1907
but it would also mean you dont take a shot at mao this turn which is something id want to see,1,True,2,germany,england,1,353,Spring,1907
in this plan i leave bre open i suppose thats too great a risk with france there,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,354,Spring,1907
well especially if im asking for frances help yeah but even without revealing the plan i still think its a risk,1,True,2,germany,england,1,355,Spring,1907
could you ask france for support into the channel maybe,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,356,Spring,1907
or say that youll support france in,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,357,Spring,1907
hmmm that could work then we only have to trust that italy wont try and take brest which isnt too far fetched since they just helped you take it,1,True,2,germany,england,1,358,Spring,1907
hmm no theres an issue with the retreat if i dislodge mao,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,359,Spring,1907
heres an idea tell france youre supporting pic to bre then just bounce par in bre,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,360,Spring,1907
elegant i like it,1,True,2,germany,england,1,361,Spring,1907
italy goes to iri but i can defend with the wales army,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,362,Spring,1907
any thoughts on russia btw i imagine swe is tempting,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,363,Spring,1907
it is tempting but im not trying to fight italy and russia at the same time and russias been pretty honest with me so ill leave it for now,1,True,2,germany,england,1,364,Spring,1907
thats fair any intel on italy btw where do your relations stand,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,365,Spring,1907
italy doesnt tell me anything unless they have something to gain from me i asked if they were going to try and take the channel again and they denied it but that could be fake news,1,False,2,germany,england,1,366,Spring,1907
take it with french support otherwise it wouldnt make sense,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,367,Spring,1907
well i suppose im comfortable that italy sees me as a friend on the board,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,368,Spring,1907
youre right that if italy were to try that again it would take a lot of negotiating to get frances favor so probably youre right to not be concerned,1,True,2,germany,england,1,369,Spring,1907
alright i‚Äôll be somewhat not available this evening so can you confirm moves to make sure we‚Äôre on the same page,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,370,Spring,1907
paris supports bregas bel supports eng holding bermun munbur,1,False,2,germany,england,1,371,Spring,1907
wait no sorry i was making pie and lost track of this game im waiting on confirmation from france about picbre which i will bounce with parbre,0,True,2,germany,england,1,372,Spring,1907
making piedmont,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,373,Spring,1907
and no worries,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,374,Spring,1907
haha i wish,1,True,2,germany,england,1,375,Spring,1907
peach piedmont,1,True,2,germany,england,1,376,Spring,1907
sounds delicious,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,377,Spring,1907
france confirmed the move to bre so the plan is ago,0,True,2,germany,england,1,378,Spring,1907
ouch again care to have a chat,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,379,Spring,1907
well you werent exactly truthful either,1,True,2,germany,england,1,380,Spring,1907
i think we may need to face the fact that were just not a good match,1,True,2,germany,england,1,381,Spring,1907
i suppose you‚Äôre not interested in what i have to say then,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,382,Spring,1907
no i am alls i‚Äôm saying is that we should both be taking grains of salt with each others‚Äô words,1,True,2,germany,england,1,383,Spring,1907
yeah that‚Äôs fair with what i‚Äôm about to disclose regardless of whether you believe it or use the knowledge against me i would ask that it be confidential from anyone else on the board including the fact that i‚Äôm asking for this confidentiality i know you‚Äôve sent plenty of lies my way but if you agree i‚Äôd really like it to be the truth this time,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,384,Spring,1907
i promise not to mention it to anyone else let‚Äôs hear it,1,True,2,germany,england,1,385,Spring,1907
ok just to be really specific about it can we agree on the story that we ceased communications you said we‚Äôre not a good match and i said ‚Äúsuit yourself‚Äù and that was it and can we also promise to not make the communication obvious without saying it exactly eg ‚Äúsomeone told me xyz‚Äù when only i could have known and to be clear i‚Äôm agreeing to the confidentiality as well,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,386,Spring,1907
okay sure but there‚Äôs something i want to know and i‚Äôll keep my agreement now no matter what the answer did you in any way indicate to italy that you knewsuspected the channel plot last year,1,True,2,germany,england,1,387,Spring,1907
no he revealed the channel plot to me without me asking,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,388,Spring,1907
this was after you told me about it,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,389,Spring,1907
well that makes no sense because after i revealed it to you italy reiterated to me that they really did not want you to know about it,1,True,2,germany,england,1,390,Spring,1907
i think italy wanted to be the one to tell me so he would keep my trust i‚Äôd have to look to see whether this was revealed before or after brest went through but i know at least that before brest i was confident he wasn‚Äôt going for the channel,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,391,Spring,1907
well anyway what did you want to tell me it stays between us guaranteed but i would reserve the right to move according to this information if i think it necessary,1,True,2,germany,england,1,392,Spring,1907
yeah thats totally fine so last night i made a deal with the devil one that he couldnt refuse its a lie that i will uphold it but i think its a convincing one,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,393,Spring,1907
okay go on,1,True,2,germany,england,1,394,Spring,1907
i told italy i would do everything in my power to get him the game in exchange i asked to 1 be kept alive until the end and 2 get tips from him on how to play the game before my upcoming inperson game i told him that my win is about getting the best experience from this game so that im prepared for the inperson game this is kind of true,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,395,Spring,1907
since then hes told me some pretty interesting things ill send you some quotes,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,396,Spring,1907
that thing france said about my past successes that was true i do have a lot of experience and i have had a fair amount of success playing online diplomacy i just did not want you thinking of me that way,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,397,Spring,1907
i‚Äôll also note just cause i have nobody else to talk with about this i worked really hard on this last move germany wanted to take brest but if that happened it would have cut support and prevented your army from leaving your island so i had to convince germany to support france to brest without telling her the real reason why and i needed you to go to nao so that you could not guard liverpool there were so many lies,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,398,Spring,1907
to be completely honest i directed just about everyone else‚Äôs moves on that turn russia is the one exception but i basically knew what he was going to do the best advice i have for someone who wants to get better at diplomacy just work hard you can win by putting in more time and effort than everyone else i have success by writing a lot to everyone all the time,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,399,Spring,1907
i‚Äôm not going to lie about my moves to someone unless i am going to get a huge advantage out of it but i spend most of the game trying to make everyone else on the board feel that i‚Äôm their closest ally so a lot of what i say is a shade on the truth,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,400,Spring,1907
thats what i got,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,401,Spring,1907
and if italy continues to talk this way i might have more to share and would be happy to share it,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,402,Spring,1907
damn that makes a lot of sense thanks for sharing did he say why he was so keen to have your army on the mainland,1,True,2,germany,england,1,403,Spring,1907
its so its not on the homeland,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,404,Spring,1907
i‚Äôm surprised you were willing to do that why,1,True,2,germany,england,1,405,Spring,1907
italy promised me paris you were going to go to nth from bel and then france was going to retreat to bel,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,406,Spring,1907
oh so italy screwed you  he‚Äôll do the same to me when the time comes  would you be willing to give me some warning of when that is if you‚Äôre involved in it ya know just for the fun of sticking it to a master manipulator,1,True,2,germany,england,1,407,Spring,1907
id obviously prefer something a bit more collaborative than that italy will be at 12 supply centers this fall im not giving up on a mutually beneficial relationship here especially given that i may have some inside scoop from italy for a while,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,408,Spring,1907
13 if i help him into brest,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,409,Spring,1907
well look england given that italy or you could be talking crap at any moment i see taking your supply centers as a more certain path to my survival than having yourhis information if you are actively going to help him take supply centers then at best you‚Äôre surviving at the expense of making an enemy of everyone because you‚Äôd be italy‚Äôs dog not his ally it‚Äôs your choice though,1,True,2,germany,england,1,410,Spring,1907
ive not lied to you once this game you can check the record with admin after if youre curious have i deceived you certainly but ive not made explicit agreement to moves that i didnt follow through with that includes denmark we had discussed strategy and i said id confirm moves in the morning and then i just never did which i know was shitty so i just want to be clear on that,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,411,Spring,1907
don‚Äôt quibble semantics with me deception‚Äôs deception and we‚Äôre both guilty of it if anything it makes me trust you less if you think mere technicality gives you the moral high ground here,1,True,2,germany,england,1,412,Spring,1907
im not asking for moral high ground im giving you my knowledge that my deception to you has historically taken the form of truth if we work on being more explicit with our agreements i think we can build trust there,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,413,Spring,1907
and regardless of whether im italys dog i wouldnt be so sure of getting my supply centers i can defend everything this year and i may be able to hold you off next year as well at that point italys fleets may be in position to push you off the island,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,414,Spring,1907
what i cant defend is italy taking liverpool,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,415,Spring,1907
you can if you retreat to edi,1,True,2,germany,england,1,416,Spring,1907
at least for this year,1,True,2,germany,england,1,417,Spring,1907
no i can retreat to skag if i want i can bounce edi from nwg and bounce london from the channel,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,418,Spring,1907
so youre not saying you cant defend liverpool just that youd prefer not to now whos using imprecise language üòõ,1,True,2,germany,england,1,419,Spring,1907
no i cant italy is in mao my army is not on the island he can get there in one move and i cant,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,420,Spring,1907
nao,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,421,Spring,1907
you can if you retreat to edi,1,True,2,germany,england,1,422,Spring,1907
or york even,1,True,2,germany,england,1,423,Spring,1907
oh wow youre right that was dumb yes i can,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,424,Spring,1907
york doesnt work because the move is illegal cant go around the coast like that,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,425,Spring,1907
oh and actually i was right edi applies in the same way,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,426,Spring,1907
cly is in the way fleets have to move along the coast,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,427,Spring,1907
wait im confused what the unit displaced from nth you havent given retreat orders yet go to edi,1,True,2,germany,england,1,428,Spring,1907
ohhhhhhh of course,1,True,2,germany,england,1,429,Spring,1907
a fleet in edi cant go to lvp an army could but a fleet cant,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,430,Spring,1907
yeah you got it,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,431,Spring,1907
that confused me for a second too,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,432,Spring,1907
so if youre willing to collaborate ive got some ideas and would want to hear yours as well i genuinely think working with me against italy will be a better longterm strategy for you than working against italy or alone italy is just too strong already and as ive said before id like to see an underdog story,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,433,Spring,1907
right now my retreat is to skag which will not raise any alarms on italys end is this alright with you or would you like to see something different,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,434,Spring,1907
working with italy or alone for two messages ago,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,435,Spring,1907
updated to nwy more friendly to you,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,436,Spring,1907
well that means a lot  i take back what i said about wanting all your dots im waiting for italy to get back to me about strategy for this turn and when he does ill get back to you with what counter plan i can offer i think this is going to be a turning point where i either commit fully against you or commit fully with you and it hinges on what italy is planning just know that im not going to offer a plan to you unless its a real one no contractlaw trickery no outright deceit and if you dont hear from me well its because weve both chosen the devil and our own glorious undoing at his hands,1,True,2,germany,england,1,437,Spring,1907
haha this is fair best of luck in negotiations regardless of what you choose i commit to offering you any counteritaly intel i can gather,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,438,Spring,1907
would you be willing to also hear a plan offer from me,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,439,Spring,1907
i am and it stays between us of course,1,True,2,germany,england,1,440,Spring,1907
so broadly speaking the alliance would involve austria and that means moving against russia we have a huge advantage going into russia which takes pressure off of austria and allows austria to put pressure on italy,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,441,Fall,1907
alrighthaha i was just in a sandbox ordering you to move to sweden anyway üòÉ,1,True,2,germany,england,1,442,Fall,1907
hmm you might lose munich this year though,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,443,Fall,1907
this has been noted,1,True,2,germany,england,1,444,Fall,1907
no specific intel there just saying tactically its a possibility i dont know if italy would go for that i mean we had discussed someone going to munich before his stab but i dont know if that can be trusted,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,445,Fall,1907
well before you and i started chatting italy denied that he had any plans for munich this season but his word isnt exactly his bond,1,True,2,germany,england,1,446,Fall,1907
yeah not sure what hell do there it may be in his interest to remain neutral certainly if he catches any wind of whats going on munich is vulnerable maybe something to consider in setting up next year,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,447,Fall,1907
we get to choose what happens in brest which is great and then the tricky bit is figuring out how to kick italy off the island,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,448,Fall,1907
mhm i was sort of depending on getting a build this turn such that id have someone around to defend mun so i would be sacrificing that by working with you i can convoy holland to york,1,True,2,germany,england,1,449,Fall,1907
lets get you in brest then,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,450,Fall,1907
youd still have to dissolve somebody then,1,True,2,germany,england,1,451,Fall,1907
go down to 4 sure but if i go to sweden i stay at 4,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,452,Fall,1907
i would like your help getting liverpool back if you convoy there as opposed to having you take it however your army will be a little precarious on the island and will need a way off,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,453,Fall,1907
convoy to yor,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,454,Fall,1907
the threat of mao to iri will be a pain but i think we can manage,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,455,Fall,1907
righti wouldnt expect to get to take it liverpool if youre handing me brest  and if italy and i agree to a plan where he does some supporting from mao and he says nothing to you to contradict that plan would you take that as enough proof that iri is safe,1,True,2,germany,england,1,456,Fall,1907
yeah that makes sense ill let you know anything i hear from him hes been quiet this morning ok i need to sign off for like a while to get work done my fall moves under this plan will be nwy to swe nwg to either edi or cly pic and eng support par to bre,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,457,Fall,1907
i think the plan i have in the works might be better than yours so ill get back to you later,1,True,2,germany,england,1,458,Fall,1907
haha alright better for you or better for both of us,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,459,Fall,1907
worse for italy equally good for me potentially better for you,1,True,2,germany,england,1,460,Fall,1907
alright ill be happy to hear it,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,461,Fall,1907
new confidential italy quote i suggest that you take sweden and i‚Äôm working on getting belgium this turn too it‚Äôll be tricky to keep germany from defending it but i‚Äôm going to try,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,462,Fall,1907
did he have anything to say about you retreating to norway instead of skag,1,True,2,germany,england,1,463,Fall,1907
he was surprised but not upset i said my justification was that it was going to sweden anyways and that i wanted to warm things up with germany did you hear anything,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,464,Fall,1907
italy only just responded to me so nothing yet,1,True,2,germany,england,1,465,Fall,1907
still nothing from italy but if we were to have a plan i think it should be this  eng s bremao bremao picbre pargas bur s pargas nwyswe nwgcly nth c holedi,1,True,2,germany,england,1,466,Fall,1907
your promptness in reporting italys words to me plays to your advantage if the next message from italy to me suggests i do something that leaves belgium vulnerable ill pretty much be so revolted that ill have no choice but to stab him,1,True,2,germany,england,1,467,Fall,1907
will continue to send things your way though i‚Äôm not sure how much more i‚Äôll hear how come you prefer edi to bre your proposition seems to leave me more vulnerable,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,468,Fall,1907
also thoughts on messaging to france i‚Äôm thinking i‚Äôll ask italy what he wants me to say and i‚Äôll say that i‚Äôll also tell you what i say,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,469,Fall,1907
ugh i knew youd say that the vulnerability thing note the plan also leaves paris wide open we need to trust each other but it makes more sense for paris to move to gascony to put some pressure on ordare i dream ittake marseilles and the southern holdings since france might go poof next near it is better for me to be there,1,True,2,germany,england,1,470,Fall,1907
and in order to help your ouster from liverpool i needed somebody on the island anyway youre pretty much equally vulnerable whether theyre in york or edi,1,True,2,germany,england,1,471,Fall,1907
as for french messaging im not really sure i only just messaged them for the first time this season they asked me first what id like them to do telling them basically what ive told you that i stand at the crossroads of either playing italys game or fighting back with your help im waiting to hear which they think i should do if you want to urge them to help our plot thats your prerogative,1,True,2,germany,england,1,472,Fall,1907
france was expressing antiitalian sentiments to me italy told me to respond antiitalian so that‚Äôs what i‚Äôll do my thought about edi is that if you were to go to york and the rest of the plan stays the same we get another unit to fight with i could build an army in edi for example do you feel like you need edi as collateral i‚Äôm with you all the way on this plan so i‚Äôm willing to be flexible but i do like to understand what you‚Äôre thinking,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,473,Fall,1907
same as i was thinking before i need a build so someones around to defend munich you were willing to part with brest and let me into york so i dont see why parting with edi temporarily is really all that different,1,True,2,germany,england,1,474,Fall,1907
alright can we agree on when i get it back and how confident are you in holding mun this year,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,475,Fall,1907
this just in from italy france is ordering brest to channel germany is ordering burg s bel and convoying holland to yorkshire,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,476,Fall,1907
and the followup so here is the move norway  swe pic s channel  belgium mar  bur to cut support gas to bre to block the paris move ,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,477,Fall,1907
italys playing us both you can believe that he fed me the moves you specified then turned around and fed them to you he only gains by playing off both of us well fuck em,1,True,2,germany,england,1,478,Fall,1907
sorry for swearing,1,True,2,germany,england,1,479,Fall,1907
no swearing is fine if its against italy have you made your decision then,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,480,Fall,1907
and im a little confused about what you mean by sending us both the same moves,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,481,Fall,1907
i mean he said heres what i suggest the moves you sent me just now and i said okay sure because deception is important in this game im told then he told you the moves then you told them to me  but because he suggested leaving bel undefended and you warned me about it i had made up my mind in that moment,0,True,2,germany,england,1,482,Fall,1907
gotcha so were both sworn to take down italy i certainly am,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,483,Fall,1907
i also have a bad feeling youll be losing mun this turn have you talked to russia about it,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,484,Fall,1907
im going tell italy i agree to the proposition sound good,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,485,Fall,1907
hes as slimy as spaghetti alolio and he needs to be knocked down a peg plan on  theres nothing whatsoever i can offer russia right now so no i didnt bother talking to them about it either it happens or it doesnt far as im concerned,1,True,2,germany,england,1,486,Fall,1907
and yes please tell italy you agree to those moves i love a good surprise,1,True,2,germany,england,1,487,Fall,1907
okay to be clear plan is not on til i hear back from france but im on board,1,True,2,germany,england,1,488,Fall,1907
plan is not on but working together against italy definitely on,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,489,Fall,1907
on like beans on an english breakfast plate,1,True,2,germany,england,1,490,Fall,1907
ok im going to take your word for it that english breakfast has beans,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,491,Fall,1907
what do you think about par support bre to gas,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,492,Fall,1907
if i get into bre this will leave gas vacant the planned bur support of par wont go through based on italys moves,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,493,Fall,1907
from italy germany is now fishing for info from me about our relationship does she know that we are still talking i‚Äôd like to tell her that you‚Äôre mad at me and you will tell me nothing but we must keep our stories straight,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,494,Fall,1907
all i said was do you know anything about what englands planning so he has no idea we talk,1,True,2,germany,england,1,495,Fall,1907
i just wanted to see if hed be honest with me of course hes covering his ass by asking you first,1,True,2,germany,england,1,496,Fall,1907
yeah i believe it im going to respond and say that we shored up discussions this morning which is what we originally planned the story to be,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,497,Fall,1907
wait i thought shored up meant repaired or fortified do you mean like shuttered discussions,1,True,2,germany,england,1,498,Fall,1907
oh youre probably right i should work on my idioms,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,499,Fall,1907
i mean that you basically said i dont think we can be good allies and i was like but but  and you didnt get back to me,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,500,Fall,1907
lol so ill make sure not to use the same idiom as you if italy asks me if you and i talk,1,True,2,germany,england,1,501,Fall,1907
yep thats the story,1,True,2,germany,england,1,502,Fall,1907
my reply no but id bet shed assume it we didnt have much to say to each other this morning i tried to be friendly but she was kinda straight up about saying that an alliance wasnt going to work out and i sent a message back but havent heard anything so id imagine shed think im not just sitting here twiddling my thumbs up to you how to spin it though,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,503,Fall,1907
oh and im sure hell spin me something pretty all right,1,True,2,germany,england,1,504,Fall,1907
yeah well see and the bre to gas move i brought up repeating so it doesnt get buried,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,505,Fall,1907
if we can trust italys reported moves its the right call id say its our best option  and something that did get buried im willing to move out of edi during the upcoming fall ill dissolve my nth fleet since its only real purpose was stabbing you anyway,1,True,2,germany,england,1,506,Fall,1907
perfect and who gets lvp next fall,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,507,Fall,1907
and do you think france will do the move id rather you suggest it so i keep a low profile,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,508,Fall,1907
i still havent heard from france and we already agreed that you take liverpool,1,True,2,germany,england,1,509,Fall,1907
ok great i didnt remember if wed explicitly brought it up i think all of this will work out well if we get france on board im attacking mao from channel in preparation for a supported move to bre italy didnt mention the mao moves and id rather not ask at this point,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,510,Fall,1907
omg i thought adjudication was midnight tonight weve got so much time ill be offline for a while or i should be cause i need to stop blowing off work ive ordered f eng  mao f nwg  cly f nwy  swe a pic  bre  but well obviously discuss as adjudication approacheswe learn more,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,511,Fall,1907
new italy message hmmm germany is backing off the bait i think we will have to change our plan,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,512,Fall,1907
well thats not true but i did just disagree to something he wanted me to do in munich,1,True,2,germany,england,1,513,Fall,1907
hang on this is good were gonna see what his real priorities are he wanted me to cut support from boh and i refused,0,True,2,germany,england,1,514,Fall,1907
not sure yet but she is not going to leave belgium unguarded so that won‚Äôt work,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,515,Fall,1907
okay so hes trying to get you to change your moves regarding pic and the channel,1,True,2,germany,england,1,516,Fall,1907
yeah will be interested to see what he says,1,False,-2,england,germany,1,517,Fall,1907
ok signing off for a few hours now,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,518,Fall,1907
okay so im trying a little experiment i told italy that the last message you sent me hinted that if i didnt work with you maybe italy would i said that knowing this i know theres more than what he claims going on with the two of you theres a chance hell tell me some expected moves of yours and between what he tells me and what he tells you well know exactly what hes planning or at least get a better sense of it,1,True,2,germany,england,1,519,Fall,1907
nice ok italy‚Äôs response is consistent with what you said,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,520,Fall,1907
sigh please tell me you didn‚Äôt tell him everything,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,521,Fall,1907
heres what i said verbatim its longhope it doesnt break the bot  but englands desperate better to talk with someone than just go in blind and i doubt theyd turn to russia or france because neither is really close enoughpowerful enough to give real help and theres precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them france  and heres the real accusation for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me youve been sneaky and youve always pitted me and england against each other to your benefit my real fear here is that knowing my moves and with a desperate jovial england seeking your advice it would be so easy to just feed england enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the island   i know this from experience back when you were doing 5050 shots in the south of france i did everything i could to find out what you were planning and feed it to france this was merely a timebuying measure since france was outmatched and i would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move but i wanted to gain more dots before you took over and i assume others are like me hence i suspect you now   im offering this confession in hopes that youll do the same so just come clean and lets approach this thing as equals,1,True,2,germany,england,1,522,Fall,1907
i may have gone a little overboard but all my reasoning and everything i say is factual so he has no reason to suspect you as long as you insist we dont talk,1,True,2,germany,england,1,523,Fall,1907
alright that adds up something about getting a message from italy about it right after you sending me that made me a little nervous i‚Äôve explained that we don‚Äôt talk,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,524,Fall,1907
ive confronted him before about deliberately pitting us against each other so he knows ive always been suspicious of your relationship,1,True,2,germany,england,1,525,Fall,1907
gotcha ok he said that you were pressing hard for moves and that he would respond that we‚Äôre friendly but haven‚Äôt discussed particular moves,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,526,Fall,1907
yeah thats been his line so far the lying bastard,1,True,2,germany,england,1,527,Fall,1907
in fairness he doesn‚Äôt know my actual moves haha still nothing from france nothing from my end,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,528,Fall,1907
yeah radio silence france might have a lifebetter work ethic than any of us or maybe just doesnt care about this game anymore,1,True,2,germany,england,1,529,Fall,1907
haha yeah well if we hear nothing that may be cause for concern if i‚Äôm not in brest this fall i‚Äôll have a disband,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,530,Fall,1907
but speaking of work ethic i am gone until tomorrow for real this time let‚Äôs reconvene in the morning,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,531,Fall,1907
ok sounds good,1,True,2,germany,england,1,532,Fall,1907
soitaly really did not take kindly to my confession i retaliated with ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt trust me so be it but i‚Äôm not going to just roll over and let you dominate this game‚Äù  you can cement italy‚Äôs trust of you in the morning by reporting that i‚Äôve approached you with a plan we can talk about what form that plan should take or you can just feed italy anything but the truth   france is on board with the stab just fyi happy to leave brest if they‚Äôre to be believed and i think they are,1,True,2,germany,england,1,533,Fall,1907
ok where did france say he would go from bre,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,534,Fall,1907
gas that‚Äôs still the plan right,1,True,2,germany,england,1,535,Fall,1907
updates on my end france asked for my preference on where to go i told italy this i asked italy what i should say back italy said it shouldn‚Äôt matter because he believes france is lying,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,536,Fall,1907
yes gas is the plan,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,537,Fall,1907
well if you tell france anything other than gas i look like a liar,1,True,2,germany,england,1,538,Fall,1907
i will tell france gas as well and it seems like italy is indifferent about what i say so it shouldn‚Äôt raise any eyebrows there,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,539,Fall,1907
now what plan would hypothetical you approach me with,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,540,Fall,1907
i don‚Äôt think you should tell italy france‚Äôs real move is it too late,1,True,2,germany,england,1,541,Fall,1907
gimme a bit to fabricate a good hypothetical plan,1,True,2,germany,england,1,542,Fall,1907
not too late but then i worry about what to tell france i suppose if france is a spy we‚Äôre doomed anyways but it would be bad to be found out before the stab,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,543,Fall,1907
what if i just don‚Äôt respond to france,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,544,Fall,1907
also i‚Äôm going to ask italy for any update on the state of belgium as if i haven‚Äôt received a plan from you yet and then when we‚Äôre ready with the plan i‚Äôll say you messaged me,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,545,Fall,1907
if france is a spy we‚Äôre royally fucked i‚Äôm 95 sure that‚Äôs not the case,1,True,2,germany,england,1,546,Fall,1907
please lie to italy,1,True,2,germany,england,1,547,Fall,1907
i will should i reply to france though,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,548,Fall,1907
also i think when you have a fake plan you should type the message up to me like you‚Äôre asking for real that way i have it on hand to send to italy,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,549,Fall,1907
okay please reply to france i‚Äôm going to sleep,1,True,2,germany,england,1,550,Fall,1907
i told france if italy asks what i told france i will say something different but i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ask,1,,-2,england,germany,1,551,Fall,1907
hi england i know that the last thing i said to you was that a partnership between us wouldnt work out but ive had a genuine change of heart the reason for that is that i think italy is far more duplicitous than any of us ever realized right now they may be promising you that youll take centers of mine and maybe even that you two will share a victory together this is my guess because these are the promises they made to me not so long ago but we both need to face facts italy has never hesitated to profit from discord between us and will always aid the weaker of us at the expense of the stronger  if youre tired of being manipulated in a game italy feels they own i have a proposal that might get us both destroyed but at least well have stuck up for ourselves and perhaps minorly inconvenienced italy on their path to victory this proposal involves france who is more than willing to use their last few turns to fight back against italy trusting them may be a hard sell but so is trusting me if i were really trying to trick you i wouldnt ask something so unreasonable as that you trust us both but frankly i consider knocking italy down a peg to be the sole most urgent thing we can do to keep this game viable for any of us  my proposal is nwgcly nth convoy holyor engiri or wal bel s breeng picbre parpic burpar munbur i figure im about to lose mun anyway and if that happens ill disband my hel fleet next year well be wellpositioned to boot italy off the island and the iberian what do you think,1,False,2,germany,england,1,552,Fall,1907
this part is not for copypasting to italy i designed this plan to make it look safe for italy to convoy gaslvp i know this is what theyd really like to do i think we need to do everything we can to try and disrupt this i know its a riskier move trying to assist bre into mao but i think its the right one i also think that for extra insurance nwg should poke nao because worstcase scenario italy doesnt try the convoy and moves naolvp and also moves maonao to bounce this guarantees bre makes it into mao which strengthens our ability to take the southern holdings and at worst only sets you back a turn in terms of kicking italy out of liverpool in exchange for doing this riskier move i agree to convoy to york instead of edi and give up my build that part of the fake plan is actually true,1,True,2,germany,england,1,553,Fall,1907
italy is telling me to expect a bounce in bre so that‚Äôs not consistent with the convoy idea maybe he‚Äôs lying,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,554,Fall,1907
but i haven‚Äôt sent the plan yet,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,555,Fall,1907
so all he says is expect a bounce he could think im going to try and take it from you and this could be further misdirection about the convoy,1,True,2,germany,england,1,556,Fall,1907
italy cant make a bounce if we attack mao and gas at the same time which the real plan has us doing,1,True,2,germany,england,1,557,Fall,1907
that‚Äôs fair it could be a bounce we expect from you keep in mind that the french fleet disbands in the fall assuming it leaves bre so if it gets into mao it will then vacate by spring,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,558,Fall,1907
better to vacate mao than gas i think,1,True,2,germany,england,1,559,Fall,1907
hmm i mean if we really think it‚Äôs a convoy disrupting the convoy is a great option you‚Äôre saying i support bre from channel and let me see how italy responds to the message,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,560,Fall,1907
yes youd support bre from the channel and bel will support the channel,1,True,2,germany,england,1,561,Fall,1907
i also don‚Äôt think hitting nao makes sense then we won‚Äôt be able to take lvp next spring,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,562,Fall,1907
sometimes its like you dont even read my messages i acknowledge that wed have to wait til fall im making a sacrifice too by convoying to york instead of edi and im willing to do that because i think its the right move even if theres not a convoy theres still a chance you fall into nao which is advantageous,1,True,2,germany,england,1,563,Fall,1907
the way i see it we dont stand a chance unless we can take mao and start beating italy back into the mediterranean,1,True,2,germany,england,1,564,Fall,1907
you didn‚Äôt make it clear that yor was a real move,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,565,Fall,1907
i said in exchange for doing this riskier move i agree to convoy to york instead of edi and give up my build how can i get clearer than that,1,True,2,germany,england,1,566,Fall,1907
whoops haha i‚Äôm still in bed looking on my phone and it‚Äôs a lot of text,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,567,Fall,1907
i know sorry i get wordy when im on the war path,1,True,2,germany,england,1,568,Fall,1907
it‚Äôs quite alright do you think it‚Äôs worth saying anything to germany if you‚Äôre confident that the convoy is the move what additional edge do we get by sharing fake info,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,569,Fall,1907
you mean to italy i do think its worth it because italy will realize that ill turn to you if im no longer allied with him by reporting the plan you cement italys trust in you if you didnt report the plan italyd suspect you it also gives italy a false sense of confidence in what ill do  tentative request after the stab goes through do i have your permission to send italy the quotes from italy that youve sent me italy went to such lengths to defend himself and make me feel guilty for questioning him and the sheer hypocrisy of it is so revolting i want to throw his own betrayal back in his face i figure hes not going to trust you after the stab anyway,1,True,2,germany,england,1,570,Fall,1907
furthermore italy may respond to my plan by offering you moves to counter it and you can bet that the moves offered will turn to italys benefit we can see if these moves keep you away from mao and nao which will further confirm italys got his eyes on the convoy,1,True,2,germany,england,1,571,Fall,1907
ok i have to get to campus let me send the quote to italy and then i‚Äôll process all this and respond later,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,572,Fall,1907
oh and one more thing as long as we think the convoy is the real move we also know that spain is gonna support mao unless italy is really really cocky so ill need to support you into bre with paris to make sure you get there this means burgundy will have to try for gas unsupported but again if were confident the convoy is the play im willing to risk it,1,True,2,germany,england,1,573,Fall,1907
ive told france the new move is to mao and france confirmed so the moves the plan needs from you are  eng s bremao bel will support eng holding picbre paris will support nwyswe nwgnao  let me know if you take issue with any of these or if you ever hear back from italy  we have a shot that at least one of these moves will get us somewhere but i recognize this plan is nowhere near as sure a thing as if you just cooperated with italy i want to give you one last chance to back out,1,True,2,germany,england,1,574,Fall,1907
alright im online now give me a moment to process everything,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,575,Fall,1907
ok all of this looks good to me,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,576,Fall,1907
great note that you actually gain a build with this plan so even if the move to nao doesnt pan out you can just build an army in edi and use that to take back lvp,1,True,2,germany,england,1,577,Fall,1907
yeah thats what im thinking if we dislodge the convoy i get two you really think italy wont try to snag por,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,578,Fall,1907
entered moves f eng s bre  mao f nwg  nao f nwy  swe a pic  bre,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,579,Fall,1907
if theyre convoying i would bet not if theyre not convoying then perhaps but i think an open mao is still better than an italian mao   those moves look good no word from italy,1,True,2,germany,england,1,580,Fall,1907
from italy okay i think that‚Äôs the right move this is the first turn in a while that is fairly unpredictable from my point of view it would be really great if you wind up with a build,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,581,Fall,1907
wait he thinks what is the right move,1,True,2,germany,england,1,582,Fall,1907
i said id agree to your proposal but instead move to london and edi expecting one of them to bounce,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,583,Fall,1907
brilliant lets hope he buys it,1,True,2,germany,england,1,584,Fall,1907
he definitely trusts me which is why i think no support from spa is a possibility like if he really trusts me going to london why wouldnt he go for it,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,585,Fall,1907
also im really hoping you wont lose mun that would cause some problems,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,586,Fall,1907
can you copy in your set of moves just so i can see the summary if theres any you want to strike from the record out of paranoia i totally understand,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,587,Fall,1907
full record f bel s eng  a bur  gas  f hel  kie  a hol  yor  a mun  tyr  f nth c hol  yor  a par s pic  bre,1,True,2,germany,england,1,588,Fall,1907
cool i guess the support in bel is only relevant if mao surprises with supporting bre in or something like that,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,589,Fall,1907
right and i have a weird bias for having my units do something other than hold,1,True,2,germany,england,1,590,Fall,1907
i also wanted to talk postwar relations since you brought that up my ideal would be total silence to italy from both of us as tempting as it is to gloat italy will use any gloating we do to convince others on the board that were schemers unreliable sharing intel at an absurd level etc,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,591,Fall,1907
we also should start courting austria once the moves go through,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,592,Fall,1907
poststab relations,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,593,Fall,1907
we can try to court austria but should do so with extreme trepidation lest anything get shared with italy,1,True,2,germany,england,1,594,Fall,1907
yeah no sharing of specific moves with austria at least not at the beginning but the alliance is natural since im moving against russia and were both moving against italy and we really want it to be a solid 3 on 2,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,595,Fall,1907
nicely done thoughts on the silence to italy idea,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,596,Fall,1907
also austria just took a beating,1,,-2,england,germany,1,597,Fall,1907
accurate we should sent condolences their way,1,True,2,germany,england,1,598,Fall,1907
and i wont speak to italy,1,True,2,germany,england,1,599,Fall,1907
ok i wont either hes going to be sending some nastygrams our way im sure,1,True,-2,england,germany,1,600,Fall,1907
yeah if you get a juicy one send it to me,1,True,2,germany,england,1,601,Fall,1907
ugh im kicking myself i wish id supported burgas but hindsights 2020,1,True,2,germany,england,1,602,Fall,1907
so maybe try to cool it with russiaim thinking were gonna need to go 4 on one if we want a shot at stopping him,1,True,1,germany,england,1,603,Winter,1907
yeah i‚Äôll try to be amicable with russia i feel like you‚Äôll have more sway since you didn‚Äôt just take his territory,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,604,Winter,1907
italy just said ‚Äúwell played‚Äù,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,605,Winter,1907
well hes correct about that,1,True,1,germany,england,1,606,Winter,1907
and im trying to make overtures to russia and austria right now,1,True,1,germany,england,1,607,Winter,1907
haha yeah i agree that taking down italy will be tough even if he‚Äôs operating mostly alone,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,608,Winter,1907
italy to me well this game just got less fun,1,True,1,germany,england,1,609,Winter,1907
haha still figuring out what builds will be trying to piece together a plan to get you a build from italy this year but it looks like that may be a challenge well have to make a couple of good guesses,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,610,Winter,1907
i think your builds are pretty obvious right fleet in lvp army in edi  in spring ill support edi into lvp meanwhile lvp moves iri with support from the channel and nwg pokes nao,1,True,1,germany,england,1,611,Winter,1907
with your permission ill move nthedi and then edicly in the fall this way we can shove italy out of nao come next spring,1,True,1,germany,england,1,612,Winter,1907
i agree with the builds and ill review the tactics we really need an italian disband this year to break the line with what youve presented we wont get spa or mar and by next spring we may have italy in lyo and wes not sure if we have a better option on our end but ill keep thinking,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,613,Winter,1907
right i dont think theres much we can do about the south besides get one of us in gascony and put a fleet in brest and hope for the best,1,True,1,germany,england,1,614,Winter,1907
nevermind its better i think to risk italy in nwg since thats actually not a huge threat nwg should go to edi and nth should go to lon dammit wed be in such a better position if i hadnt been so paranoid that russia would move to munich then id have kept my fleet in hel,1,True,1,germany,england,1,615,Winter,1907
was just running through some tactics i think i found an issue but i want to check with you suppose italy ends up with fleet in portugal army in spain fleet in lyo fleet in wes army mar i think this is a stalemate line and i dont think we can do anything to stop italy from forming it,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,616,Winter,1907
i mean you could mess with north africa from mao i guess but at that point were looking at tunis as the next build on our front and that only works if neither nao nor iri gets behind the line,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,617,Winter,1907
fingers crossed you can find a flaw in my thinking,1,,-1,england,germany,1,618,Winter,1907
i guess the point is that no amount of cleverness is going to get us those dots until we see disbands if my thinking is correct of course,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,619,Winter,1907
i think you‚Äôre right‚Äîif dots is what you‚Äôre after you‚Äôre better off stabbing me and russia than collaborating but i think you‚Äôll that just getting italy under control takes priority russia and austria might see some dots but if we do it‚Äôll take a lot longer,1,True,1,germany,england,1,620,Winter,1907
i agree i could stab russia with moves on st p or something i‚Äôm not in great tactical position to stab you right now if i wanted to no question that italy‚Äôs the target but we‚Äôll be dancing with those fleets until they‚Äôre off the board from a loss of supply centers that changes my thinking about our moves a bit,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,621,Winter,1907
i know for a fact we can disband at least one of the fleets i ran quite a few sandboxes in lieu of working today and ill share moves in the morning,1,True,1,germany,england,1,622,Winter,1907
yeah if you found one that‚Äôs great let me know,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,623,Winter,1907
woah all armies from italy i guess i was seeing things through the lens of the worst he could do to us,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,624,Spring,1908
given that the beta test ends in 1909 what are your goals just duke it out until then,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,625,Spring,1908
was not aware of that but yeah ill just go down fighting italy like hopefully everyone else,1,True,1,germany,england,1,626,Spring,1908
thats pretty disappointing this game was just getting good,1,True,1,germany,england,1,627,Spring,1908
yeah admin said this in the general thread a while back i agree it‚Äôs a bit of a shame to see it cut short but i suppose we‚Äôre just the beta testers i will be glad to be finished though it was fun but like way too much distraction and stress haha,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,628,Spring,1908
would you play online again after all this,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,629,Spring,1908
i‚Äôm not sure i would,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,630,Spring,1908
i think i would youre right that its way too much distraction but hey it keeps me off the streets,1,True,1,germany,england,1,631,Spring,1908
hmm something tells me that you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be out committing violent crimes haha but then again how well do i really know you from playing a lying game i will say i‚Äôd be down to do an inperson one with cs students at some point,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,632,Spring,1908
btw all other powers me included will be setting for a 5way draw this move,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,633,Spring,1908
i had been thinking the same thing do you know anyone besides me and admin at umd who plays  uh huhsureee they will,1,True,1,germany,england,1,634,Spring,1908
afaik theres no drawback to submitting the draw order if youre ok with the outcome if theres not consensus play just continues as normal well i think admin adviser has played i know redacted had expressed interest in playing not sure about students though,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,635,Spring,1908
and im sure i could recruit a couple of nonumd friends to play,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,636,Spring,1908
im on board with the fiveway draw by the way   and i think theres a couple board game enthusiasts in my lab who may not have played this particular game before but would probably like itif you dont mind playing with new people,1,True,1,germany,england,1,637,Spring,1908
yeah always down to play with new folks and i‚Äôm down for the draw as well,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,638,Spring,1908
reply all to italys message first if you didnt get a message from italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board please let me know im down for the draw that he has proposed id also like to add that ill be checking the adjudicate once all powers have issued orders box if everyone does this maybe we dont have to wait until sunday night to have this resolved im not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units but will be submitting for the 5way draw really enjoyed playing with you all but im exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,639,Spring,1908
‚Äô we were supposed to hug it out any idea who wasn‚Äôt on board,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,640,Spring,1908
sorry for not coordinating moves i really thought the game was gonna be over,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,641,Spring,1908
so did i and i have no clue who wasnt on board,1,True,1,germany,england,1,642,Spring,1908
i guess we try the draw again i suppose it‚Äôs possible a game could be set up to not support the regular draw settings i dunno,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,643,Spring,1908
not sure your interest level in the game at this point but we should at least make sure italy doesn‚Äôt win right,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,644,Winter,1908
can italy take five centers this turn,1,True,1,germany,england,1,645,Winter,1908
nah but maybe admin will be like ‚Äúoh btw let‚Äôs go until 1914 now‚Äù,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,646,Winter,1908
any guesses on who is holding out on the draw,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,647,Winter,1908
who keeps screwing with the draw though do you think italy suggested it just to mess with all of us,1,True,1,germany,england,1,648,Winter,1908
oh haha we just asked the same thing,1,True,1,germany,england,1,649,Winter,1908
that‚Äôs my best guess he‚Äôs kind of the only one with the incentive to keep it going and with his winning track record probably the only one who cares enough to be this sneaky,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,650,Winter,1908
well im honestly not invested enough to care if that happens anyway,1,True,1,germany,england,1,651,Winter,1908
i‚Äôm not very invested either but i‚Äôd rather not see italy win especially if this is how he did it,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,652,Winter,1908
well let me know if theres anything you want me to do then,1,True,1,germany,england,1,653,Winter,1908
ok will do we‚Äôve got a day before the next move,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,654,Winter,1908
i think,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,655,Winter,1908
ok would you be up for paris support brest hold and then get one of your fleets into the channel and then dont go to nth as ill be moving nth to nwg and denmark to nth to make sure he cant break through in the north yor holds,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,656,Winter,1908
pic support brest hold as well would guarantee that he cant take it from the channel,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,657,Winter,1908
pic needs to support paris but other than that ok,1,True,1,germany,england,1,658,Winter,1908
pic cant since its a fleet,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,659,Winter,1908
im supporting paris from brest,1,,-1,england,germany,1,660,Winter,1908
oh rightok thanks,1,True,1,germany,england,1,661,Winter,1908
and actually can yor support wales,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,662,Winter,1908
yep,1,True,1,germany,england,1,663,Winter,1908
great glad were doing this since i think otherwise italy has a serious shot at 18 by the end of 1910,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,664,Winter,1908
wait im actually doing our moves wrong if we want to hold paris i need to attack gas from bre otherwise eng cuts bre support gas supports bur to par so im going to do that instead,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,665,Winter,1908
im doing my moves wrong,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,666,Winter,1908
par to gas is a good move paired with that cuts support for either the bre or par attack from italy and the armies will bounce right back to where they came from up to you though,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,667,Winter,1908
looks like it all worked a little surprised about the supported move into brest do you want it,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,668,Winter,1908
looking at the board a bit more well have to be clever to keep italy from any more centers on our side of the board i think the following will do it bre and par to gas ruh to bur channel to mao nth to nwg we can ask russia to attack tyr to cut support tri is going to fall anyways i can hold the island as long as yor doesnt attack me,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,669,Spring,1909
the brest support was just in case italy moves gas into brest supported by eng i should have realized that with lon moving to eng that move would not have gone through anyway but im not paying as much attention to this game anymore,1,True,1,germany,england,1,670,Spring,1909
and okay your plan seems to make sense but ill check,1,True,1,germany,england,1,671,Spring,1909
cool sounds good,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,672,Spring,1909
okay submitted those moves,1,True,1,germany,england,1,673,Spring,1909
im doing same moves as last time except for supporting wales to iri,1,True,-1,england,germany,1,674,Winter,1909
hey there what are your thoughts on an antienglish opening like a sea lion as germany if you enjoy something like that then we might make good allies,1,True,0,france,germany,1,0,Spring,1901
bonjournot sure what a sea lion is,1,False,0,germany,france,1,1,Spring,1901
its when a lion is stranded at sea like in the life of pi,1,True,0,france,germany,1,2,Spring,1901
that was a tiger let me know what youd like me to doi imagine it involves letting you take belgium,1,True,0,germany,france,1,3,Spring,1901
good point sea tiger sounds more menacing anyway   it all depends on how you like to play germany and your relationship with russia i can be flexible and if it makes sense for me to have belgium to set up for a future play then that is good with me,1,True,0,france,germany,1,4,Spring,1901
admittedly ive never played this game before dont go spreading that around,1,False,0,germany,france,1,5,Spring,1901
you sound experienced for someone who is playing the game for the first time im sure few people would be able to tell,1,True,0,france,germany,1,6,Spring,1901
i appreciate that mon ami,1,True,0,germany,france,1,7,Spring,1901
nice moves what are your thoughts on the map,1,True,0,france,germany,1,8,Fall,1901
well im wondering what youre up to in burgundy for starters,1,True,0,germany,france,1,9,Fall,1901
haha i was looking to secure a position on belgium and it seemed like the best way to do it depending on your plans i could take belgium with burgundy which could set us up nicely to work together,1,False,0,france,germany,1,10,Fall,1901
sorry for the late reply the bot was down,1,True,0,france,germany,1,11,Fall,1901
i think taking belgium with burgundy would be wise,1,,0,germany,france,1,12,Fall,1901
that sounds ominous what are your thoughts on england,1,True,0,france,germany,1,13,Fall,1901
any plans for holland would you want to support burgundy to belgium its hard to read you and im not sure what you are planning,1,True,0,france,germany,1,14,Fall,1901
so much for being wise üòÇ  üòÇ,1,True,0,france,germany,1,15,Winter,1901
can we have a conversation at some point id love to figure things out with you,1,True,0,france,germany,1,16,Winter,1901
sorryi was out last night and couldnt answer your questions  i was cagey because i still have no sense of who to trust and who not to but id like to trust you if you think you can trust me too i understand if not because of my unannounced visit to burgundyi was just attempting to have some insurance in case there was funny business,1,False,0,germany,france,1,17,Winter,1901
thanks for getting back to me and no worries hopefully when the deadline is moved away from midnight it will be a bit easier lol  to be totally fair to you you never actually said you wouldnt move to burgundy for me it isnt a trust issue but a communication issue which i think can be easily fixed,1,True,0,france,germany,1,18,Winter,1901
have you been talking to england at all,1,True,0,france,germany,1,19,Winter,1901
i did england tried to make a deal with me to take belgium i was supposed to support es move from the north sea while attacking burgundy but we both reneged,1,True,0,germany,france,1,20,Winter,1901
i see i ask since i have a feeling england might be playing us against eachother he also asked for support to belgium lol for now im building armies but maybe we can get to a point where we can reestablish a border between us,1,True,0,france,germany,1,21,Winter,1901
id rather settle the matter of burgundy diplomatically rather than with force any chance you will consider withdrawing from burgundy,1,True,0,france,germany,1,22,Winter,1901
the one thing i think neither of us can afford is a war of armies we would be giving away the entire ocean to englands units and theres an italianaustrian coalition growing that will be a concern in the long run,1,True,0,france,germany,1,23,Winter,1901
i gotta say france right now it seems like the best move for me is to work against you so i‚Äôm not so hemmed in,1,True,0,germany,france,1,24,Winter,1901
that said i‚Äôm no strategist what are your thoughts,1,True,0,germany,france,1,25,Winter,1901
lets say you built armies in munich and kiel and started marching in my direction these armies cant go on water they cant move past gasconyparismarseilles as my units will soon be there and so the only places to go for your armies are ruhr and thats about it isnt this a huge traffic jam wouldnt you be hemming yourself in even more by building armies thats what i mean by it will be devastating to both of us to get into an army war and let england control the entire ocean were bidding over such a small area of land,1,True,0,france,germany,1,26,Winter,1901
one option for we could consider is that i could dislodge your army and you could choose to remove it from the board that way you could build it in a place where you might need it more if you are feeling hemmedin,1,False,0,france,germany,1,27,Winter,1901
no thanks i dont think thats in my best interest right now,1,True,0,germany,france,1,28,Winter,1901
ok sounds like youve already made up your mind about things let me know when that changes,1,True,0,france,germany,1,29,Winter,1901
not sure what your plan is im covering marseilles paris and belgium so you have no chance to take a supply center this turn,0,,0,france,germany,1,30,Spring,1902
the bot was down but i meant to contact you earlier,1,True,2,france,germany,1,31,Winter,1902
you put up quite a strong defense against me which im sure was your goal,1,True,2,france,germany,1,32,Winter,1902
i was suprised you retreated to munich over marseilles that one turn but it worked out for you,1,True,2,france,germany,1,33,Winter,1902
i want to help you protect your supply centers if that is alright with you,0,True,2,france,germany,1,34,Winter,1902
why do you want to help me,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,35,Spring,1903
im worried about england and you are frankly one of the only things stopping him from attacking me im just looking at it rationally what is england going to do with all those fleets i wish we were able to work something out so that both of us would have some fleets at least but rihgt now england has 4 fleets and you have 1 and i have 2 and hes going to blow up your fleet in holland this turn its basically a guarantee,0,,2,france,germany,1,36,Spring,1903
lets say he gets 2 builds and builds 2 fleets am i going to be able to stop him even if russia and i team up hell dominate the entire ocean,0,,2,france,germany,1,37,Spring,1903
at that point it really wont matter how many supply centers i take from you because i wont be able to prevent an english fleet invasion,1,,2,france,germany,1,38,Spring,1903
i mean what are your thoughts on the whole situation,1,,2,france,germany,1,39,Spring,1903
we should talk more im not lying about wanting to help you but its hard because you arent talking to me and everything you have done so far this game seems to have been against me,1,True,2,france,germany,1,40,Fall,1903
well fat lot of good its done me i think youre right about the danger of letting england control the sea but im not sure what i in my current state can do about it,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,41,Fall,1903
can helgoland blight move to the north sea this would cut support allowing me to take the english channel,1,True,2,france,germany,1,42,Fall,1903
it could but that would leave holland undefended,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,43,Fall,1903
hmm thats a good point and kiel is probably busy defending berlinmunich since russia is in the baltic and silesia and could double team you with italy its funny there are so many units at your doorstep but you might end up keeping all your dots this turn,1,True,2,france,germany,1,44,Fall,1903
i assumed you were working with england somewhat after last turn since it seemed like he could have guaranteed holland and chose not to,1,True,2,france,germany,1,45,Fall,1903
if supporting munich is what is preventing kiel from blocking holland i can support munich,1,False,2,france,germany,1,46,Fall,1903
that wouldnt be enough i need to defend munich and berlin somehow and theres no way to do both without kiel,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,47,Fall,1903
yeah you are right i cant think of a way to do it either no worries we can try something next turn depending on how the moves turn out,1,True,2,france,germany,1,48,Fall,1903
well you did well for yourself that turn üôÇ really impressive diplomacy,1,True,2,france,germany,1,49,Fall,1903
i want to apologize for entering ruhr i wasnt sure what else to do honestly i should have given you a heads up and thats my fault im sorry,1,True,2,france,germany,1,50,Fall,1903
and its ended up being doubly bad as now im a turn behind in terms of defending myself with italy coming after iberia and all sigh,1,True,2,france,germany,1,51,Fall,1903
i think we are at the point where we should talk about working together if you want a decent result i think your best bet is to work with me,1,True,2,france,germany,1,52,Fall,1903
i honestly do since i think your growth potential is going to be limited by the fact that we both have way too many armies and not enough fleets so this means that your growth is limited to parisbelgium and thats if you make it past 4 armies,1,True,2,france,germany,1,53,Fall,1903
what im trying to say is that the big winners are italy and england,1,True,2,france,germany,1,54,Fall,1903
were the big losers theres almost nothing we can do unless russia you and i plug the holes in our defenses by working together,1,True,2,france,germany,1,55,Fall,1903
have you talked to russia at all about this,1,,-2,germany,france,1,56,Winter,1903
what would you want me to do this year,1,,-2,germany,france,1,57,Spring,1904
hi francewanted to confirm our plan for this season and next i disrupt nth support from holland and in exchange youll kindly scooch out of belgium in the fall into ruhr i imagine at which point ill build a fleet in holland,0,True,-2,germany,france,1,58,Spring,1904
actually id have to build the fleet in kiel i think,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,59,Spring,1904
1 i have were both trying our best to defend ourselves from england were too far from eachother for tactical manuevering but so far weve managed to avoid any losses,1,True,2,france,germany,1,60,Spring,1904
2 despite italian incoming invasion i am still completely focused on taking the channel as that will give me much needed breathing room if holland can move to the north sea it will cut support and i will take ec,1,True,2,france,germany,1,61,Spring,1904
3 i am withdrawing from ruhr i know this leaves me open to you taking it back and working with england to capture belgium in the fall i cant think of another way to get you a center so my promise is that if the board doesnt shake up somehow ill give you belgium either this turn or next turn on the condition that you build a fleet,1,True,2,france,germany,1,62,Spring,1904
thats correct you can build a fleet from kiel or from berlin but not from holland you need to make sure one of those is vacated during the winter phase vacating kiel can be dangerous as england is in denmark and could in theory take kiel from you,1,True,2,france,germany,1,63,Spring,1904
i will vacate belgium in the fall for you not yet sure what the best way to do it would be to make sure we dont lose it or holland to an english fleet,1,True,2,france,germany,1,64,Spring,1904
i know england has their eye on sweden so well see how that baltic region shapes up next turn and that will determine where i build my fleet,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,65,Spring,1904
its risky but i think ill be safe leaving berlin vulnerable to russia in the falllet me know if you hearthink otherwise when that time comes,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,66,Spring,1904
will do i definitely agree i spoke with russia briefly and i believe he intends to leave you alone from now on,1,True,2,france,germany,1,67,Spring,1904
good guy russia sorry if youve been watching me type ive been starting to ask you questions and then confirming their answers for myself in a sandbox üòÇ,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,68,Spring,1904
no worries feel free to ask anyhing though the sandbox is really helpful too üôÇ,1,True,2,france,germany,1,69,Spring,1904
okayreal question assuming you take the channel with brest an then england retreats to london arent you going to just lose the channel anyway,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,70,Spring,1904
oh wait nevermind i can prevent that if i keep my fleet in holland and prevent nth support twice but this means i need to move kiel into ruhr during the spring to take my sweet promised belgium in the fall picardy will have to support my movement of ruhr into belgium and youll have to disband the unit thats all fine right,1,False,-2,germany,france,1,71,Spring,1904
buuut england could foresee this and support with the london fleet and move with nthin which case at least they lose nth i guess,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,72,Spring,1904
great point i will have to disband a unit anyway in the fall after losing belgium so it wont matter if i need to pull it,1,True,2,france,germany,1,73,Spring,1904
losing the channel might be rough thats true hmm i actually hadnt thought too much about it i think if he does that at the very least i can retreat into wales and threaten liverpool assuming that wales goes to cover london,1,True,2,france,germany,1,74,Spring,1904
give me a reason to defend myself against italy as it stands im just going to let him solo,1,True,2,france,germany,1,75,Spring,1904
what do you think italy is going to do once he kills me,1,True,2,france,germany,1,76,Spring,1904
dont you agree that austria will need somewhere to go with all his armies,1,True,2,france,germany,1,77,Spring,1904
i swear im trying my hardest to work with you,1,True,2,france,germany,1,78,Spring,1904
look i will defend myself against italy but i need to know that i will be in the draw if you and england are just going to fuck me from behind then there is no incentive for me to defend myself against italy,1,True,2,france,germany,1,79,Spring,1904
hey i really am sorry about the stab you probably wont believe me but let me explain myself  i knew i was making a deal with the devil when i agreed to help england but england italy austria and russia wereare basically all allied and i figured it was either you or me they turned on the turning point was when i realized that after i stab england you might not even hold the channel anyway i couldnt afford to risk fury from all sides   but now im in a potentially very good position for you england and italy trust me i am in the process of finding outunder no suspicion mind you because of our alliance and shared planstheir moves for this season once i learn those i can relay them to you,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,80,Fall,1904
doing so would clearly be in my interest the longer youre in the running the longer i escape getting devoured myself on three or more fronts,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,81,Fall,1904
if you manage to look just lucky or smart by making the right moves to counter their attacks this season i can continue to doubleagent and help keep you defended and possibly even expanded into england  i just spoke with england and i can confirm that you will be able to take the channel if you want totheyre supporting me into belgium from nth   i cant be as direct asking this of italy but im trying to figure out whether theyre going to use the lions share of their force against marseilles or spain if i can figure this out you may have a better chance of holding  im going to send the info your way whether you believe me or not,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,82,Fall,1904
ok i get that im sorry for not explaining it well losing the channel doesnt matter to me it gives me excellent retreat options and allows me to defend myself against italy without worrying about what england is up to,1,True,2,france,germany,1,83,Fall,1904
theres no way russia is allied with italy and austria just look at how aggressive austria is in attacking russia,1,True,2,france,germany,1,84,Fall,1904
nothing can be done at this point though thanks for the offer of intel this is basically all i wanted to hear as long as i have a chance to be in the draw i wont give up and maybe something will shake up and give me a chance to recover,1,True,2,france,germany,1,85,Fall,1904
you should work on england hes not even communicating with me i must have done something to piss him off but if he keeps this up its going to end badly for him too,1,True,2,france,germany,1,86,Fall,1904
for the future let me know in advance when you are planning something like this if i knew you were not cutting the north sea i would have played this way differently by bouncing italy out of the west med and wed be in a much stronger position,1,True,2,france,germany,1,87,Fall,1904
it‚Äôs not that russia is allied with austria but russia is cooperating strongly with england to the point that they don‚Äôt even talk to me for what it‚Äôs worth i can confirm that italy‚Äôs going to shoot for spain,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,88,Fall,1904
they meaning russia i get kind of annoyed with everyone using ‚Äúhe‚Äù to refer to these players,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,89,Fall,1904
i am sure russia is just uncommunicative since the start of the game hes only sparingly talked with me,1,True,2,france,germany,1,90,Fall,1904
theyve sorry,1,True,2,france,germany,1,91,Fall,1904
just given that they seem to be fighting in scandinavia but you probably have more information than i do,1,True,2,france,germany,1,92,Fall,1904
by the way whats the plan that italy and england proposed to you in terms of your units are you attacking burgundy with ruhr and munich,1,True,2,france,germany,1,93,Fall,1904
oh thats not a fight thats planned highfives at least according to england nopeattacking belgium with ruhr and amsterdam were in the process of discussing whether munich should bother poking belgium,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,94,Fall,1904
burgundy,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,95,Fall,1904
i take back what i said about italy shooting for spain i thought it was decided but italy wants to keep that decision to themself,1,True,-2,germany,france,1,96,Fall,1904
thanks im probably going to flip a coin for spainmarseilles has england expressed any concern over the italianaustrian growth i worry that england has been charmed by italy or maybe they just dislike me that much,1,True,2,france,germany,1,97,Fall,1904
yes that worked very well youre getting a build please please please build a fleet üôÇüôÇüôÇ,1,True,0,france,germany,1,98,Winter,1904

neat bot is back up now hmm maybe it was just the one message that was bugged somehow whoops ill copy paste it back,1,True,0,france,germany,1,103,Spring,1905
what do you want to do here i am really hoping that we can coordinate something together i think ai is starting to have some pressure put on their relationship with a greedy italy i understand england is in a tough position where their best move is probably to stay put and do nothing which is always a tough sell i just wish they would actually read my messages instead of sabotaging my ability to help them fight italy,1,True,0,france,germany,1,104,Spring,1905
i checked out italys history hes redacted from playdiplomacycom hes ranked the number one player on the entire site and thats probably the most popular diplomacy site of them all,1,True,0,france,germany,1,105,Spring,1905
if we dont stop this here hes going to solo no question,1,True,0,france,germany,1,106,Spring,1905

anonymity is tough to keep up with the discord names and the fact that the usernames are in the backstabbr too that being said i didnt mean to upset you if youre uncomfortable discussing that if it makes it better i have ignored it completely until i recently found out about the published names it doesnt have to be a discussion point its pretty clear by now that italy knows what they are doing,1,True,0,france,germany,1,110,Spring,1905
haha fair enough that is true it is unfair im totally guilty of accidentally assuming masculine pronouns in online games and im working on changing that since it is a big issue its good to do as a default and i appreciate that you brought it up i think austria italy turkey russia and i know eachother albeit with varying degrees of familiarity,1,True,0,france,germany,1,111,Spring,1905
i know you were joking a bit when you said anonymity did you no good in this game but seriously i think you are playing great i would have never guessed you are a first time player are you really sweatsmile you are playing extremely well,1,True,0,france,germany,1,112,Spring,1905
any news from england i hope that they will consider working to stop italy,1,True,0,france,germany,1,113,Spring,1905
i messaged them but havent heard yet,1,True,0,germany,france,1,114,Spring,1905
ok heres what i  know england is going to keep away from russias northern holdings for a while in order to avoid feeding austria however the norway fleet is headed for mao for the start of next year and england is very much still intent on seeing you consumed italy has told me definitively which of your centers is getting full force this turn under some pretense about needing to coordinate so me and england could be more effective and its spain im going to hold and support belgium and move kieruh with support,0,True,0,germany,france,1,115,Spring,1905
im also going to poke bur,1,True,0,germany,france,1,116,Spring,1905
thanks so much for the info will do any chance you go to tyrolia instead of poking burgundy it wont matter for me that much but for you it could save a lot of headache and potentially exacerbate ai tensions,1,True,0,france,germany,1,117,Spring,1905
alternatively a written commitment from italy not to go to tyrolia would be smart,1,True,0,france,germany,1,118,Spring,1905
im not ready for italy not to trust me anymore ill try to see about that commitment though,1,True,0,germany,france,1,119,Spring,1905
that turn went well for you with russia out of silesia you certainly have more breathing room only downside may be italy in tyrolia but hopefully they committed to not moving there or at least are aware that you arent ok with it hanging out there thanks to you italy has ground to a halt in southern france im hoping we can repeat it again this turn  you should ask england for denmark if they say no no big deal but it should be yours they are the ones that took it from you and its significantly hampering your manueveravility and ability to build units where you want to as it borders the extremely important kiel,1,True,0,france,germany,1,120,Spring,1905
italy offered not to move into tyr but gave a good justification for why they werent interested in attacking munich so i let them  i just asked england about denmark   as for italy ill have to come up with the right pretense to extract their plans again this turnmaybe you could help me with that england and me are pretty much in the routine of sharing moves though so youre at least guaranteed those,1,True,0,germany,france,1,121,Fall,1905
sweet assuming englanditaly want you to move into burgundy you could pretend to be worried that i might bounce you out of burgundy and ask if italy has some moves that can help occupy my units in marseilles and gascony,1,True,0,france,germany,1,122,Fall,1905
any updates by any chance,1,True,0,france,germany,1,123,Fall,1905
i‚Äôm waiting to hear from italy,1,True,0,germany,france,1,124,Fall,1905
any info you think might help me in defending against england and italy my plan is literally giving you all my centers while italy and england get nothing since i cant defend all three and you are the only one who has been helping me,0,True,0,france,germany,1,125,Fall,1905
im assuming england is going all in and moving to nao maybe even to irish and channel,1,True,0,france,germany,1,126,Fall,1905
right england is moving to nao but otherwise holding everything this turn no deal on denmark unfortunately next year will be a play for mao  and italy is deadset on randomizing their move so im sorry i dont have intel for you this timei did try though england at my suggestion offered to assist italy into mao but italy refused,1,True,0,germany,france,1,127,Fall,1905
thanks,1,True,0,france,germany,1,128,Fall,1905
and as for me ill be taking bur,1,True,0,germany,france,1,129,Fall,1905
darn that went poorly,1,True,0,france,germany,1,130,Fall,1905
it was a coin toss nothing you could have done i didnt foresee or know about the move to naf but in hindsight it makes perfect sense,1,True,0,germany,france,1,131,Fall,1905
its kind of a privilege getting to watch italy play esp knowing who he is,1,True,0,germany,france,1,132,Fall,1905
yeah for sure hey but thanks for all your help id have died a lot sooner if not for you,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,133,Winter,1905
its been a pleasure thanks for playing with a newb üòÉ,1,True,1,germany,france,1,134,Winter,1905
if youre having fun id encourage you to check out face to face games in your local area online is great but ftf is really something else üôÇ,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,135,Winter,1905
anyway id like to be a part of the discussion for how to distribute my dots id ideally like this to go in a way where it sets up you and italy nicely to take out england and austria,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,136,Winter,1905
i see this game lasting longer if italy receives as few dots as possiblewhats your reasoning for favoring i over e,1,True,1,germany,france,1,137,Winter,1905
i am pretty sure england will stab you once they are done killing me italy has austria to deal with but england has nowhere to go mao is a huge stalemate line italy can litterally have a unit in spain portugal and mao not to mention wmed and naf and there is nothing england or you can do to get past that line,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,138,Winter,1905
if you and england were going to be a long term alliance england needed to be in the mao helping me keep the lines years ago at this point even if i give england all my dots italy has enough units to the point where its locked up so thats the logical reason but theres also the fact that england hasnt replied to my messages in over ten seasons and i have evidence of then working closely with italy i think thats a pretty big indication that they will hand italy dots and have no intention or interest in working with me,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,139,Winter,1905
in the end i probably am eliminated either way so if you want to give england a shot then i can swing that way but id highly recommend against it even though im sure you trust england very much,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,140,Winter,1905
okay i see your point about mao and england having nowhere to go,1,True,1,germany,france,1,141,Winter,1905
thanks for disbanding picthat helps me out a lot are you speaking with italy at all about your plans,1,True,1,germany,france,1,142,Spring,1906
nope italy hasnt replied,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,143,Spring,1906
italy just told me as much too says they dont trust youbut your track record with me has been pretty good so i want to continue to work with you  and actually ive been seriously mulling over a backstab of england this turn and i was wondering if you would want to help specifically if you think that mao is destined for italy anyway ill support you into the channel meanwhile ill move a fleet into hel and an army to kiel to prepare to swipe denmark  i havent entirely thought this through but what do you think,1,True,1,germany,france,1,144,Spring,1906
that sounds great if we knew english orders we could potentially come up with an even deadlier plan ill have to think more about it but if england convoys into brest again i could move brest to picardy to let it in and bounce nao with italy dislodging mao i could then retreat to the irish sea and take liverpool while paris picardy and gascony could reclaim brest this would have the advantage of not making moves that would give away the stab in the spring,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,145,Spring,1906
so im paris in that scenario right  and im talking with england about their orders right now they want to take iri this turn actually and want me to support nth into the channel if i agree they actually prefer to move nwg into nth than try for nao thats how unwilling they are to just give me denmark back,1,True,1,germany,france,1,146,Spring,1906
oh wow i see hmm well looking at the map i think this would still work wed need to find a way to make sure england cant take holland in the fall or we could just risk it i think it makes sense to move brest to the english channel instead of mao so that i have the option to retreat somewhere valuable like into nao,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,147,Spring,1906
these moves guarantee denmark but england could retreat to sweden which is something to be aware about,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,148,Spring,1906
i agree about bresteng but me and england are still hammering stuff out so its not final yet,1,True,1,germany,france,1,149,Spring,1906
breaking news england has decided or at least has told me that they dont want to try for iri anymore instead theyre planning to convoy into brest or pic im waiting on their reply to confirm which poke nao from nwg and otherwise holdsupport as appropriate,1,,1,germany,france,1,150,Spring,1906
ugh sorry but the plan changed again england is going to poke nao but otherwise just hold everything no convoy   i can still move brest into the channel if you want and if you really want to irk england you can move to iri if i also set myself up for denmark like i said id have to move ruhr into holland to defend there leaving my southeast pretty exposed but i think thats a reasonable risk right now  what do you think,1,,1,germany,france,1,151,Spring,1906
theres also a nonzero chance that england is lying to methey seemed pretty suspicious of me this time around compared to previous conversations however im pretty certain theyre not lying about not trying to convoy theyre really insecure about you getting close to the island and not having anyone there to defend it,1,,1,germany,france,1,152,Spring,1906
youre retreating to portugal right if you can poke mao from brest you may be able to defend spain and if italy does something crafty so that you end up falling into mao i can fall intobump england from brest,1,True,1,germany,france,1,153,Spring,1906
huh so you really dont like england i guess,1,True,1,germany,france,1,154,Fall,1906
darn i missed this message actually i should have told you what i was planning i think italy had spain guaranteed with maoportugal and marseillesspain with 2 supports italy actually then offered me on retreating to the irish sea and in exchange we would collaborate on dislodging the english channel i figured it would benefit you as well since this would prevent england from getting off of the island if they were to convoy to belgium or something,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,155,Fall,1906
oh goodglad to hear italys talking with you  but england could retreat to pic,1,True,1,germany,france,1,156,Fall,1906
were not talking much it was kind of a spontaneous thing you are right to be concerned about the retreat to picardy ill have to see if that can be avoided somehow if not its not the end of the world if absolutely needed i can just not support the supposed italian move to the channel which may or may not happen anyway,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,157,Fall,1906
anyway you also have a guess kind of not sure about what youve told england about the last moves but perhaps they will use the north sea to support denmark to hold in which case the support can be cut from belgium,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,158,Fall,1906
that was one of a few scenarios i was thinking about but i gotta say i dont like the idea of italy in the channel i thought you were going to be there did italy give a reason why they want it,1,True,1,germany,france,1,159,Fall,1906
is it okay if i ask italy about it,1,True,1,germany,france,1,160,Fall,1906
thats fair it might be best to not ask italy directly but that is up to you just because it seemed that if italy is actually serious about this proposal they would want the element of surprise italy wants to do this probably because they want to take the gamble and hope that it will shake up the west a little bit they didnt actually say that but it is what i infer,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,161,Fall,1906
i did end up askingcouldnt handle the suspense and ever since i heard about it ive been wondering if theres some plotting i could do to turn this to my and your advantage at the expense of both italy and england italy said they wouldnt do it if i didnt want them toim thinking i could demand that they use wes to bounce with england in mao which then means that the battle for spain becomes 2 v 2 and you keep it,1,True,1,germany,france,1,162,Fall,1906
thats really clever wed have to hope that italy wouldnt move mao to portugal but otherwise that works well,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,163,Fall,1906
meanwhile i could support you into the channel from iri,1,True,1,germany,france,1,164,Fall,1906
sure,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,165,Fall,1906
does that mean you are not going after denmark,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,166,Fall,1906
well im trying to gauge es trust of me right now so ill see and get back to you,1,True,1,germany,france,1,167,Fall,1906
any news,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,168,Fall,1906
are you going to assist italy into the channel,1,True,1,germany,france,1,169,Fall,1906
england doesn‚Äôt trust me unfortunately so i don‚Äôt think i can swing anything clever,1,True,1,germany,france,1,170,Fall,1906
i probably will do you think italy actually intends to follow through,1,,-1,france,germany,1,171,Fall,1906
i think so from talking to them but ive been wrong before ive come around to the idea actually a weekend away from this game has cleared my head so should i support brest holding from paris btw are you going to let me keep paris,1,True,1,germany,france,1,172,Fall,1906
yep you can stay in paris if you can support brest hold that would be amazing,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,173,Fall,1906
ill submit the orders to support italy into the channel then and just see what happens,1,True,-1,france,germany,1,174,Fall,1906
im sorry france i made an 11thhour deal literally in the past two minutes with england and italy i really really did not mean to deceive you,1,True,1,germany,france,1,175,Fall,1906
no worries its the game and i think you made the right choice as long as you arent afraid to lie to englanditaly  im rooting for you to do well this game congrats on 2 builds,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,176,Winter,1906
thanks ive learned a lot from you this game so thanks for talking with me üòÉ,1,True,6,germany,france,1,177,Winter,1906
happy to i still have one dot left and it looks like fleet picardy will be the most useful to you but i can keep gascony or something else as well now that all the french centers are gone you will have to decide between italy and england,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,178,Winter,1906
i feel like italys 10 welldefended units made that decision for me but even if i change my mind on that i think pic would be the most helpful to keep,1,True,6,germany,france,1,179,Winter,1906
me and italy are strategizing now about ousting england from brestthe channel are you more willing to support one of  those two moves,1,True,6,germany,france,1,180,Spring,1907
actually we could support you into brest then have you support one of us into the channel in fall,1,True,6,germany,france,1,181,Spring,1907
sure,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,182,Spring,1907
moving to brest right now,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,183,Spring,1907
excellent do you and italy have any kind of agreement about portugal,1,True,6,germany,france,1,184,Spring,1907
well italy said that they would consider letting me keep it as long as i am useful ,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,185,Spring,1907
well this move definitely is so i hope they keep their word,1,True,6,germany,france,1,186,Spring,1907
nice turn for you i wonder what england will do at this point based on their retreat it looks like they could be defending london and edinburgh so a convoy to yorkshire or possibly even a move to norway seem like the strongest plays,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,187,Fall,1907
cant believe italy is going to get into liverpool,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,188,Fall,1907
anyway im holding in brest for now but let me know if i can do something else with that unit,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,189,Fall,1907
yeah thats an unpleasant surprise has italy promised you anything based on some things ive pieced together im starting to realize the full extent of their manipulation of this entire game its honestly kind of unsettling  i hope this can stay between us france but ive got two sandboxes up right now one where i put aside my beef with england just to try and get italy under control and one where i keep dancing with the devil which i will follow through with only on the condition they agree not to take one of liverpool or portugal this year neither of these plans has you staying in brest if youre willing to do either of those things help with an italy stab or more english destruction at the expense of brest let me know and let me know which youd prefer if not well that may tip the scales to me staying with italy because i dont think we can swing the stab without your help,1,True,6,germany,france,1,190,Fall,1907
happy to order whatever you want,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,191,Fall,1907
i know theres no chance for me to live in this game unless someone else wants it i think i may have some insight thats worth keeping me around but if it makes more sense for me to go out now ill do it,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,192,Fall,1907
youre good people france and i have italys word that theyre not taking portugal anytime soon though italys word is literally not worth the electric current encoding it   what insight are you referring to may i ask,1,True,6,germany,france,1,193,Fall,1907
thanks i definitely dont want to see italy run away with this game hmm well i guess i may be able to offer insight in terms of helping with orders im sure an egr alliance can stop the ai mathematically we will hold 17 centers at the end of this year which is usually the magic number to prevent a solo since you need 18 to win unfortunately it doesnt leave any leeway to lose ground anywhere and more eyes on the map can be useful,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,194,Fall,1907
im assuming austria cant be turned against italy ive tried for the past couple years even organizing a 3 way convo between russia austria and i i dont think austria is willing to stab italy,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,195,Fall,1907
i know i said earlier that it would make sense for you to work with italy though ive admittedly changed my mind especially after the last orders italy is nigh unstoppable if you and england fight since italy will soon reach a critical number of units where they can defeat any opponent also there are no easy stalemate lines in the west to stop them anymore really,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,196,Fall,1907
its ultimately up to you though i could see a scenario where you work with italy to take out england and a well timed austria stab of italy leaves you to establish a strong defense and get a good draw result,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,197,Fall,1907
so thats exactly what italy has promised me however i know for a fact that hes italy has lost the courtesy of nonspecific they in my book been working with england and feeding england my proposed moves for this turn keep that quiet please  without revealing that england has been communicating with me i think i might be about to get italy to confess what hes been doing hes asked for a half hour to pick his kids up from school despite my urging that he abandon them and respond to me now and then hes going to respond if he confesses im going to side with italy in which case id like you to move into the channel where both bel and mao maybe will support your move  if he doesnt paris will support you into gascony meanwhile eng moves iri and bel moves eng in the north i convoy to edi englands willing to allow me the build this winter while eng moves nwg,1,True,6,germany,france,1,198,Fall,1907
sounds good,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,199,Fall,1907
im only talking to you at this point no info will be leaked,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,200,Fall,1907
convoying to edi sounds like a good idea i dont have context on italys plan at all but if i were him id probably convoy gascony into liverpool,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,201,Fall,1907
italy is vile and even if we all die doing it i want to see him minorly inconvenienced i‚Äôd like to move forward with the antiitalian plan and support you into gas,1,True,6,germany,france,1,202,Fall,1907
done,1,,-6,france,germany,1,203,Fall,1907
since we me and england think that italys going to try the convoy from gas to lvp we actually think its better to try and have you disrupt mao eng will support you into mao sorry for the latebreaking change,1,True,6,germany,france,1,204,Fall,1907
ok,1,True,-6,france,germany,1,205,Fall,1907
good game france thanks for everything,1,True,7,germany,france,1,206,Winter,1907
gg good luck,1,True,-7,france,germany,1,207,Winter,1907
hello there whats your general plan for this game my inclination when i play austria is to piss off as few people as possible so i dont plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn,1,True,-1,austria,russia,1,0,Spring,1901
hey hey   dont really have much of a plan yet  like you i generally try not to piss off too many people at the start until i get a feel for the lay of the board so my general decision at start is really just mos  ukrstp   right now my default inclination is to go ukr and try to get rum that may change as i talk to other players  happy to talk about trying to take that with fleet or army depending on how spring goes and certainly not looking to commit to any particular longterm growth direction right now  that being said ar is one of my favorite duos rf is up there too but i dont think ive ever even seriously tried to pull that off in an online game  thats a ftf option where i know the players üòÉ    im assuming standard galicia bounce right now happy to discuss other options,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,1,Spring,1901
yeah i was figuring standard galicia bounce too keeps both of us honest,1,True,-1,austria,russia,1,2,Spring,1901
so heres my pitch i have been on both sides of the deal when austria italy and russia decide that everything would be simpler if there wasnt a turkey every time things have indeed been simpler for air so whaddya think wanna simplify our game,1,True,-1,austria,russia,1,3,Spring,1901
i literally just told italy to go after turkey first üòÄ,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,4,Spring,1901
oh fwiw id just as well neither of us tried for galicia this turn if you dont mind,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,5,Fall,1901
works fine for me,1,True,-1,austria,russia,1,6,Fall,1901
they free people of rumania depend on your good will i assume hes going to force black so that would actually leave him pretty exposed to you and italy should you so desire,1,True,0,russia,austria,1,7,Spring,1902
i certainly wont be helping him take rum so i think you can survive this,1,True,0,austria,russia,1,8,Spring,1902
well it looks like that worked great im in a position to force bulgaria youre getting sev back and youll be set to keep rum id appreciate it if you could support greece to bulgaria,1,True,0,austria,russia,1,9,Spring,1902
oh i didnt reply yet did i  yes i can give that support,1,True,0,russia,austria,1,10,Spring,1902
and if feel bad except turkey didnt even reach out to me even once last season to try and pitch something like blowing up my fleet to try and work together later on  just completely went radio silent after the setup,1,,0,russia,austria,1,11,Spring,1902
yeah turkey has not been handling this fantastically,1,True,0,austria,russia,1,12,Fall,1902
i assume the greece swap wasnt negotiated,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,13,Winter,1902
no no it was not there are some heated discussions happening,0,True,-1,austria,russia,1,14,Spring,1903
what are you planning to do,1,True,-1,austria,russia,1,15,Spring,1903
well i was planning on finishing off ü¶É  tell me what you need,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,16,Spring,1903
more specifically im planning to take black other than that mostly looking to reposition north,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,17,Spring,1903
that works just fine for me,1,True,-1,austria,russia,1,18,Spring,1903
italys really angling to get me to attack you ive put him off from expecting anything this season fyi,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,19,Spring,1903
good to know,1,True,-1,austria,russia,1,20,Spring,1903
welcome back to the land of open channels anyway you know you and italy dont have to fake fight on my account right,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,21,Fall,1903
the tyrolia move is to slow down the west i think,1,True,-1,austria,russia,1,22,Fall,1903
sure i more meant the greece swap with attendant noise and the immediately swapping info on outside communications üòÄ,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,23,Fall,1903
heh so you taking ankara,1,True,-1,austria,russia,1,24,Fall,1903
planning on it then its mostly a matter of seeing where englandfrance take their relationship,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,25,Fall,1903
yeah they seems to have a bit of a clusterfuck going on should be fun to watch at least üòõ,1,True,-1,austria,russia,1,26,Fall,1903
indeed how do you feel about a good old fashioned bounce over galicia,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,27,Fall,1903
sure works for me,1,True,-1,austria,russia,1,28,Fall,1903
no need to confirm or deny but i assume your deal with italy is to convoy greece to smyrna,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,29,Fall,1903
its been discussed not 100 sure if its happening,1,True,-1,austria,russia,1,30,Fall,1903
for my two cents its either that or you just take the second turkish dot for yourself i wouldnt want him growing with armies all up along the border,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,31,Fall,1903
italy is starting to be squirrely with me can we avoid the bounce in galicia i want to get that unit moving to vienna,0,True,-1,austria,russia,1,32,Fall,1903
i didnt hear from you in time so i left the bounce order in place and i covered serbia in case you got cute what do you want to do now,0,True,-1,austria,russia,1,33,Fall,1903
yeah sorry  good call on your part as i was already asleep by the time you sent that  i want to go deal with england now to be honest the question is what do you want youre the one who needs an obvious path to move in,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,34,Fall,1903
if you need a sales pitch im not squirrelly at nor do i tend to negotiate via wild mood swings üòÄ,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,35,Fall,1903
i wholeheartedly support you going after england i think my most long term success comes from going after italy so im going to build an army in trieste and let italy go get engaged with france while i come after him,0,True,-1,austria,russia,1,36,Winter,1903
im building army sebastopol for the obvious defense  assuming you do build in trieste will take steps to demilitarize that border no move to galicia or otherwise in your direction cooperate on smyrna moving units away as soon as possible,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,37,Spring,1904
balls in your court  i never really understood the strategy of lying on the builds as theres little payoff to it generally but we are where we are  youre wellpositioned to make a move either direction i can only repeat that im really only set up to defend against you and actually more interested in moving north,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,38,Spring,1904
that was less a lie and more my having changed my plans to be in line with what i messaged you but not being able to update my orders in time,0,False,-1,austria,russia,1,39,Spring,1904
fair enough  either way math remains the same  if you want to move on mewell yall will win two dots eventually  if you want to go the other way youll get two right away and ill happily feck off to the north  to be honest neithers really a bad option for you given how aggressively austria has shifted west so balls truly in your court,1,True,1,russia,austria,1,40,Spring,1904
that was for the terrible pun üòÄ,1,True,-2,russia,austria,1,41,Spring,1905
i will note that im not even remotely pressing you and im not the one you need to worry about,1,,-1,russia,austria,1,42,Winter,1906
you gonna talk to me again at some point,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,43,Winter,1907
yeah sorry about that,1,True,-2,austria,russia,1,44,Winter,1907
clearly some turnaround needs to be done here what do you want to see me pull,1,True,-2,austria,russia,1,45,Winter,1907
i want you to keep whatever you need to start recovering dots,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,46,Winter,1907
now that im home in all honesty any three units you keep have their own possibilities and risks id assume youd keep the ones around budapest but i can work with whatever you keep,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,47,Winter,1907
i think i gotta keep rum bul and ser because they give the best chance of stopping italy and theyre the ones in positions that you cant quickly get into,1,True,-2,austria,russia,1,48,Winter,1907
if you could support rumbud thatd be greatly appreciated,1,True,-2,austria,russia,1,49,Spring,1908
absolutely,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,50,Spring,1908
can i cover rum to keep that army on the frontline,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,51,Spring,1908
sure,0,True,-2,austria,russia,1,52,Spring,1908
thanks  alright bud isnt guaranteed but its as close as we can come  you have support tyr will be cut and ill cover the eastern flank,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,53,Spring,1908
actually i suppose i should say it is guaranteed if you use ser to support but in the spring covering tri may be just as useful  not my call,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,54,Spring,1908
you know what  ignore the question about rum  i have to cover galicia anyway,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,55,Spring,1908
whats your train of thought on the draw,1,True,-2,austria,russia,1,56,Spring,1908
i have it set  i set it right at the start of this turn actually and england and i both talked about it then,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,57,Spring,1908
seems to me like everyone is in then ive got it set and set for early adjudication,1,True,-2,austria,russia,1,58,Spring,1908
so did you veto the draw,1,True,-2,austria,russia,1,59,Winter,1908
hell no i want this torture to end,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,60,Winter,1908
and im approaching from the point of view of assuming theres no artificial end date as it turns out doing this one extra turn is good for me but in the long run my position isnt going to improve any,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,61,Winter,1908
oh  he cant take serbia without losing trieste btw  if serbia wanted to support tyr  triit probably wont matter but could in an edge case,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,62,Winter,1908
good idea so oedered,1,,-2,austria,russia,1,63,Winter,1908
er ordered,1,,-2,austria,russia,1,64,Winter,1908
gdi all supports for bud to serbia unless you have a better idea,1,True,2,russia,austria,1,65,Spring,1909
i do not,1,True,-2,austria,russia,1,66,Spring,1909
sorry you died dude  i did legit try to keep you alive üòÉ,1,True,5,russia,austria,1,67,Winter,1910
the effort was appreciated,1,True,-5,austria,russia,1,68,Winter,1910
hi england i dont think we really have anything to talk about yet but best of luck,1,True,0,austria,england,1,0,Spring,1901
hi austria agreed theres not a ton to talk about in the short term id would like to ask though how relations with russia and germany are looking for you,1,True,0,england,austria,1,1,Spring,1901
and best of luck to you as well,1,True,0,england,austria,1,2,Spring,1901
havent heard from either of them yet but when i do ill let you know,1,True,0,austria,england,1,3,Spring,1901
sounds good,1,True,0,england,austria,1,4,Spring,1901
so you built f lon and france built f bre eh trouble in paradise,1,True,0,austria,england,1,5,Spring,1903
haha yeahhh france is the worst he tried to tell me it was to protect against italy,1,True,0,england,austria,1,6,Spring,1903
working with italy and germany to stave off france is the goal but germany is annoyed at me taking denmark maybe france and germany are collaborating now france needs to go though,1,True,0,england,austria,1,7,Spring,1903
hi congrats on toppling turkey we should have a chat about russia before our spring moves,1,True,0,england,austria,1,8,Fall,1903
whatcha thinking,1,True,0,austria,england,1,9,Fall,1903
well we obviously cant help one another directly but were both bordering the most powerful country on the board by supply center count,1,True,0,england,austria,1,10,Fall,1903
indeed and were both in position to aim at whittling that count down which im gonna do,1,True,0,austria,england,1,11,Fall,1903
its somewhat on us to contain russia id rather us both put pressure on russia than you put pressure on italy or i put pressure on germany,1,True,0,england,austria,1,12,Fall,1903
italy and i are pretty solid so russia is next,1,True,0,austria,england,1,13,Fall,1903
great ill be fighting against france as well so i may only be able to hold russia off in the north,1,True,0,england,austria,1,14,Fall,1903
whatever you can do itll be appreciated,1,True,0,austria,england,1,15,Fall,1903
are you and italy still good after the surprise in trieste,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,16,Winter,1904
im not happy with him us being good well that depends on what he builds,0,True,2,austria,england,1,17,Winter,1904
yeah that will be interesting to see that move actually makes me nervous about collaboration with france there was a guessing game about where to provide support if he wanted a supply center maybe the bump in spain was arranged,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,18,Winter,1904
yeah who knows,1,True,2,austria,england,1,19,Winter,1904
looks like youre sitting pretty with regards to russia will be curious to see where the disbands come from,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,20,Winter,1904
hi theres some stuff we should talk about,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,21,Spring,1905
whatcha got in mind,1,True,2,austria,england,1,22,Spring,1905
im slightly concerned about this being kept confidential,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,23,Spring,1905
can you agree to keep what i say confidential regardless of what i say obviously only talking ingame stuff not about to confess to a murder or something,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,24,Spring,1905
absolutely whats up,1,True,2,austria,england,1,25,Spring,1905
1 italy is telling us both that we‚Äôre his true longterm ally 2 italy is the highestrated player on playdiplomacycom  i don‚Äôt think either of those things are necessarily relevant this year but i wanted you to be aware,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,26,Spring,1905
ahaaaa good to know,1,True,2,austria,england,1,27,Spring,1905
also if im going to weaken the russian line to let you in well need to come to some agreements first,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,28,Spring,1905
whatcha got in mind,1,True,2,austria,england,1,29,Spring,1905
nothing this spring so dont worry about anything last second ill message back after we see the moves,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,30,Spring,1905
sounds good,1,True,2,austria,england,1,31,Spring,1905
i havent done all the math yet does he have a guarantee to hold rum that was messier than i expected,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,32,Spring,1905
i dont believe he does ive got quite a few on it and the ability to cut a lot of supports,1,True,2,austria,england,1,33,Spring,1905
youll need to coordinate with italy to do the bounce in ser to prevent the retreat there but yeah i think youre right,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,34,Spring,1905
scratch that italys not in tri anymore,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,35,Spring,1905
yeah and im retreating to ser thing i gotta worry about is that boh army walking into vienna,1,True,2,austria,england,1,36,Spring,1905
oh yeah i should be paying more attention actually i should probably be sleeping yeah thats a risk,1,True,-2,england,austria,1,37,Spring,1905
sleep is a good idea im heading that way myself this weekend was great but very tiring,1,True,2,austria,england,1,38,Spring,1905
btw italy claims he is not in fact the highest rated player on playdiplomacycom and that this is just a rumor made up by france but his username does happen to be the same not that any of this is that important but it‚Äôs interesting,1,,-2,england,austria,1,39,Spring,1905
looks like we might have a common enemy in italy sorry about the stab there,1,,3,england,austria,1,40,Winter,1907
reply all to italys message first if you didnt get a message from italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board please let me know im down for the draw that he has proposed id also like to add that ill be checking the adjudicate once all powers have issued orders box if everyone does this maybe we dont have to wait until sunday night to have this resolved im not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units but will be submitting for the 5way draw really enjoyed playing with you all but im exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats,1,True,3,england,austria,1,41,Spring,1908
i got it im in for the draw,1,True,-3,austria,england,1,42,Spring,1908
so did you veto the draw,1,True,-3,austria,england,1,43,Winter,1908
no if you‚Äôre asking everybody this can you let me know what you hear back i texted the admin to see if 1 draw settings are somehow disabled and 2 if 1909 is still going to be the last year part of me thinks maybe italy is turning down the draw make people think the game is over and then still try to scoop up centers,1,True,3,england,austria,1,44,Winter,1908
i have in fact asked everyone thus far russia and germany say they didnt veto,1,True,-3,austria,england,1,45,Winter,1908
yeah i honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs out of the question that draws are disabled though i don‚Äôt know the site well enough to know whether this would be obvious to us ie draw settings disabled but like if you‚Äôre running a study and want to get data maybe you make it so people can‚Äôt end the game early and get their 25 right away,1,True,3,england,austria,1,46,Winter,1908
i think it would be obvious also actually the option to disable draws is very new let me look and see if they tweeted about when it was introduced as compared to when the game started,1,True,-3,austria,england,1,47,Winter,1908
looks like the game was created just after the option was instituted so maybe its in place i think it would probably be more obvious it was enabled however,1,True,-3,austria,england,1,48,Winter,1908
yeah well i‚Äôll let you know when i hear back from the admin i feel like italy is the only one with the incentive to not draw if everyone gets lazy on their moves he can try to keep scooping up centers,1,True,3,england,austria,1,49,Winter,1908
well best of luck holding on through 1910 seems like youll make it as long as russia is a friend,1,True,3,england,austria,1,50,Winter,1908
hello there whats your general plan for this game my inclination when i play austria is to piss off as few people as possible so i dont plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn,1,True,0,austria,turkey,1,0,Spring,1901
i suggest containment of russia at the very least and perhaps his destruction,1,True,0,turkey,austria,1,1,Spring,1901
that certainly sounds just fine to me i think turkey and austria can make for a very good alliance  you build a bunch of fleets i build a bunch of armies and we crush a bunch of dots,1,,0,austria,turkey,1,2,Spring,1901
ok lets roll i‚Äôll go north for the opening,1,,0,turkey,austria,1,3,Spring,1901
if you want to contain russia i am willing to support you into rum if you want to wait that‚Äôs ok too,0,True,0,turkey,austria,1,4,Fall,1901
id love the support thanks,0,False,0,austria,turkey,1,5,Fall,1901
done,0,True,0,turkey,austria,1,6,Fall,1901
ok,0,True,0,turkey,austria,1,7,Fall,1901
however nothing bad came if it and i still think we can work together your thoughts,1,,0,turkey,austria,1,8,Winter,1901
hi france i dont think we have a ton to talk about yet but if youre planning to go in against italy thats certainly something id like to know,1,True,0,austria,france,1,0,Spring,1901
thanks for reaching out how do you generally feel about working with italy,1,True,0,france,austria,1,1,Spring,1901
if italy wants it it can be a powerful alliance but in my experience italy rarely wants it badly enough,1,True,0,austria,france,1,2,Spring,1901
thats true and my experience as well its tricky since if hes not going after me or yoy then what are his plans if italy isnt planning to lepanto then it is worrying for one of us,1,True,0,france,austria,1,3,Spring,1901
well i havent heard too much from italy yet but once i find out more about his current intentions i will certainly let you know,0,True,0,austria,france,1,4,Spring,1901
nice things are looking up for you with the russiaturkey conflict and a seemingly friendly italy,1,True,0,france,austria,1,5,Fall,1901
yeah im feeling pretty good right now,1,True,0,austria,france,1,6,Fall,1901
has russia been talking to you i imagine he may have reached out given the builds were seeing here,1,True,0,france,austria,1,7,Spring,1902
on and off yeah were coordinating some,1,True,0,austria,france,1,8,Spring,1902
nice given england and germany seem to be working together now it may be wise to prop up russia so that they dont take all of scandinavia and split me up if you or italy can spare some armies north that would be great as well,1,True,0,france,austria,1,9,Spring,1902
ill see what i can do,0,True,0,austria,france,1,10,Spring,1902
thanks,1,,0,france,austria,1,11,Spring,1902
f bre eh im curious what youre gonna do with that,1,True,-1,austria,france,1,12,Spring,1903
i figure you cant be too happy with f lon either,1,True,-1,austria,france,1,13,Spring,1903
its made stranger by how i cant seem to contact england at the moment i hope to work things out with them diplomatically if i can,1,True,1,france,austria,1,14,Spring,1903
i reached out to england as well ill let you know what i hear,1,True,-1,austria,france,1,15,Spring,1903
quoth england france is the worst,1,,-1,austria,france,1,16,Spring,1903
i dont think that but france said it,1,,-1,austria,france,1,17,Spring,1903
thank you for the warnings about england im in a much better defensive position now,1,True,1,france,austria,1,18,Fall,1903
what are your thoughts on your relationship with italy,1,True,1,france,austria,1,19,Fall,1903
well he didnt tell me about the tyrolia move which im not yknow entirely pleased about,1,True,-1,austria,france,1,20,Fall,1903
italy didnt tell me either,1,True,1,france,austria,1,21,Fall,1903
good to know,1,True,-1,austria,france,1,22,Fall,1903
damn the no build hurts,1,,-2,france,austria,1,23,Winter,1904
are you going to do something about italy at some point theres no way italy has your best interests at heart italy and england are big buddies and my guess is that italy has been getting england and russia together the amount of trust there when england could have taken st petersburg and sweden is ridiculous thats also why italy swiped trieste from you making builds extremely difficult for you,1,,-2,france,austria,1,24,Spring,1905
i cant hold off italy for much longer italy is going to start exploding in terms of builds very soon and you are going to be taking steps backwards as long as england props up russia shouldnt italy share some of those spoils with you i think you should ask italy for trieste back or greece back you need those builds way more than italy does,1,,-2,france,austria,1,25,Spring,1905
if it were me i dont think it is fair that italy has 10 supply centers and you have 6 when i was trying to work with italy italy demanded i gave him one supply center each year looks like they are doing the same with you i dunno seems kind of draconian if you ask me,1,True,-5,france,austria,1,26,Winter,1906
maybe you can ask for trieste back,1,True,-5,france,austria,1,27,Winter,1906
there are discussions ongoing regarding balancing things out with me picking up some of the eastern dots,1,True,5,austria,france,1,28,Winter,1906
are you aware of italy manufacturing the agreement for england leaving russia alone in sweden and st petersburg,1,True,-5,france,austria,1,29,Winter,1906
thats what ive been told by england but im not sure how much to believe it,1,,5,austria,france,1,30,Winter,1906
i know you trust italy a ton and its clear you have a great relationship so this must be really hard to hear but you have to stab italy this turn or he soloes germany and england are fighting and im italys janissary no stalemate lines in sight you wont get another chance after this,1,True,-5,france,austria,1,31,Spring,1907
my gift to you is willingly suiciding so that england and germany have a chance to stop italy in the west please dont waste it though i wont be there to see it üôÇ ,1,,-3,france,austria,1,32,Winter,1907
good morning  best of luck to you and let me know how we can best avoid any unnecessary and unproductive entanglements  üòÉ,1,True,1,russia,england,1,0,Spring,1901
best of luck to you as well im likely opening north and i have my eye on norway for the fall however this may be dependent on some discussion with france can i ask where youre planning to send your moscow army this spring,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,1,Spring,1901
my initial inclination is to focus on the south  i do have to weigh that over concerns of you opening full north but hopefully we can stay on the same page  i am of course much happier if you indicate youre going to put a fleet in nwy,1,,1,russia,england,1,2,Spring,1901
thats fair enough im talking to france now about belgium as my army is pretty useless just hanging around the island i cant commit to leaving my army off of nwy just yet let me get back to you when i hear from france about belgium,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,3,Spring,1901
sounds great  good luck in your french negotiations,1,True,1,russia,england,1,4,Spring,1901
belgium definitely on the table but still not confirmed germany is acting like a big hothead btw threatening war from the outset if they dont calm down maybe we can talk about helping you into denmark next year,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,5,Spring,1901
hi i may be sending an army to norway this fall as it looks like france is trying to go to belgium however i have no intention of going to st petersburg id actually be more interested in denmark if youd be willing to support that this would be on the condition that i would help you into berlin by cutting support in kiel,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,6,Fall,1901
no worries mate  were looking fine so you do what you need to do üòÉ,1,True,1,russia,england,1,7,Fall,1901
alright well we can chat about denmark next year then,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,8,Fall,1901
hi sorry to see the trouble with turkey lets have a chat about st petersburg and denmark,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,9,Winter,1901
shouldnt be too much worry üòä im certainly not looking to start any issues with you what are you thinking about denmark,1,True,1,russia,england,1,10,Winter,1901
i dont know your thoughts on aggression against germany at this juncture but either of us could support the other into denmark this would likely cause a disband since i suspect kiel will be occupied,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,11,Winter,1901
im not necessarily opposed as long as my other border gets priority attention üòÉ,1,True,1,russia,england,1,12,Winter,1901
ok all things being equal im not opposed to popping denmark especially if you use the move to back off one of those northern units,1,,1,russia,england,1,13,Spring,1902
so like vacate norway or would you be on board with convoy army to denmark and then move nwg to nwy,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,14,Spring,1902
my preferred move would be nth to den and lon to nth but i understand if that seems a bit aggressive,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,15,Spring,1902
i was thinking either nwy to den with nwg going to norway or the fleets in filling north from norwegian but either way ill be driving for a couple hours so you have a little time to think and let me know who the mover is,1,True,1,russia,england,1,16,Spring,1902
back online  final decision on mover,1,True,1,russia,england,1,17,Spring,1902
im going for it in fall will you still be in sweden,0,True,-1,england,russia,1,18,Spring,1902
i will  will you still be in norway  if so im inclined to order swe  nwy just to build trust with germany,1,True,1,russia,england,1,19,Spring,1902
go for it  ill support hold from nwg just in case,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,20,Spring,1902
actually the support hold is unnecessary some reason i was thinking denmark could theoretically support you in i may do it anyways for kicks,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,21,Spring,1902
i wasnt going to point out there was no possible support on norway  üòÄ,1,True,1,russia,england,1,22,Spring,1902
hi looks like it was a productive spring for you are you still on board to support me into denmark i imagine that germany will be looking for a friend in you,1,,-1,england,russia,1,23,Spring,1902
yep just tell me the mover id somewhat prefer it to be norway for obvious reasons,1,True,1,russia,england,1,24,Spring,1902
plan is to convoy norway army to denmark and move nwg to norway,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,25,Spring,1902
sound good to you,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,26,Spring,1902
sounds great to me happy hunting next year i should be able to drop to baltic if you want to keep pushing,1,,1,russia,england,1,27,Spring,1902
great ive entered my moves in nwg to nwy nwy to den nth convoy nwy to den hel to kie so ill be expecting swe support nwy to den from you,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,28,Fall,1902
checking yep orders in the box,1,True,1,russia,england,1,29,Fall,1902
hi thanks for the help into denmark what‚Äôs your plan in the north for this year,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,30,Spring,1903
was debating whether to drop into the baltic,1,True,1,russia,england,1,31,Spring,1903
any thoughts you looking to keep pushing on germany,1,True,1,russia,england,1,32,Spring,1903
it‚Äôs a little complicated i‚Äôm starting to worry about a stab from france after the build in brest if i can focus on it we‚Äôre probably talking getting me into kiel and you into berlin,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,33,Spring,1903
ok ill play it loose,1,True,1,russia,england,1,34,Spring,1903
i‚Äôll keep you posted if my plans solidify,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,35,Spring,1903
great minds think alike shall we have a chat before our spring moves,1,True,-1,england,russia,1,36,Fall,1903
indeed,1,True,1,russia,england,1,37,Fall,1903
so moving forward how do you want to handle this,1,,2,russia,england,1,38,Spring,1904
well what are your intentions on the german front this year,1,,-2,england,russia,1,39,Spring,1904
to be perfectly frank looks like my attention is needed to the south the couple units up north can be flexible in their use,1,True,2,russia,england,1,40,Spring,1904
id be happy to repeat the same bounce we just did twice this year does that tie up units youd like to send elsewhere,1,True,-2,england,russia,1,41,Spring,1904
nope thats fine for this season we can reevaluate when we see what the rest of the board does,1,True,2,russia,england,1,42,Spring,1904
great i‚Äôll plan on the repeat bounce this spring and it sounds like we‚Äôll chat about it again for fall moves,1,True,-2,england,russia,1,43,Spring,1904
bounce again,1,True,-2,england,russia,1,44,Fall,1904
,1,True,-2,england,russia,1,45,Fall,1904
happy to bounce,1,True,2,russia,england,1,46,Fall,1904

sounds great,1,True,-2,england,russia,1,48,Fall,1904
no worries,1,True,-2,england,russia,1,49,Fall,1904
i would prefer not to repeat the bounce this turn,1,True,0,russia,england,1,50,Spring,1905
haha yeahh youve left it pretty wide open in the north what do i get out of showing restraint just a less powerful austria,1,True,0,england,russia,1,51,Spring,1905
i have them stopped dead as long as you show restraint üòÄ,1,True,0,russia,england,1,52,Spring,1905
well you need to make sure germany doesnt cut support in sil right,1,,0,england,russia,1,53,Spring,1905
also germany needs to not take that fleet to sweden,1,True,0,england,russia,1,54,Spring,1905
true,1,True,0,russia,england,1,55,Spring,1905
im also thinking a bit long term for you that next build probably comes from germany but you also need my help to get it and im pretty friendly with germany right now,1,True,0,england,russia,1,56,Spring,1905
to be perfectly frank im kinda happy being a stone wall for the moment and make no mistake theres potential for some fun fuckery on my part down south,1,True,0,russia,england,1,57,Spring,1905
whats a scenario in which you get a build in the south,1,True,0,england,russia,1,58,Spring,1905
rum,1,True,0,england,russia,1,59,Spring,1905
if they screw up yes more likely the count stays static but they have to keep scrambling and keep their units tied up there,1,True,0,russia,england,1,60,Spring,1905
should be fun,1,True,0,russia,england,1,61,Spring,1905
looked like fun i guess you wont be getting that build this year though,1,True,0,england,russia,1,62,Fall,1905
oh probably not theyd have to really screw the pooch to let me build but it is fun to keep them tied up,1,True,0,russia,england,1,63,Fall,1905
you can prevent a build though are you already planning this,1,True,0,england,russia,1,64,Fall,1905
hey just wanted to check in and see how things were going i‚Äôve been enjoying our friendly north so far,1,True,0,england,russia,1,65,Spring,1907
boring at the moment but steady either austria will realize his ass is hanging in the wind or italy will get greedy and either way the front opens up,1,,0,russia,england,1,66,Spring,1907
oh gdi yes i realize you need the build,1,True,-1,russia,england,1,67,Winter,1907
yeah sorry to open the floor to discussion with a stab i did need the build and getting two was far from a guarantee for me even though it turned out that way i think we have a lot to discuss how are you feeling about the state of the board,1,True,1,england,russia,1,68,Winter,1907
im kinda happy theres finally some movement to be honest and austrias finally responding to messages after a two year silence i think were on a stop the leader phase which does have some opportunities for us specifically,1,True,-1,russia,england,1,69,Winter,1907
i agree running through some tactics i see that italy can hold his western dots until hes forced to disband i think well need to see two disbands maybe three before we can break through,1,True,1,england,russia,1,70,Winter,1907
hi given that the beta test ends in 1909 wanted to check in about your goals ie thoughts on a draw,1,True,1,england,russia,1,71,Spring,1908
to be honest i totally forgot about the end date  i dunno  the only person who can even theoretically be removed by then is austria so well just see how that shakes out,1,True,-1,russia,england,1,72,Spring,1908
yeah i think he said 1910 if we really wanted but we are just the beta test italy austria and i have agreed on a 5way draw germany wants to play out but might be swayed if everyone else is on board,1,True,1,england,russia,1,73,Spring,1908
ah good point  i have the draw set now,1,True,-1,russia,england,1,74,Spring,1908
me too do you know how the draws get resolved germany is the last holdout and i think shes skeptical that shell get duped somehow if she sets it as such i thought its just that play proceeds as normal unless everybody agrees to the same thing,1,True,1,england,russia,1,75,Spring,1908
thats correct  it will only pass if its unanimous or at least until everyones draw setting is compatible  for example if four set it as four way draw and one set as surrender thats compatible with a four way draw excluding the surrendering power,1,True,-1,russia,england,1,76,Spring,1908
reply all to italys message first if you didnt get a message from italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board please let me know im down for the draw that he has proposed id also like to add that ill be checking the adjudicate once all powers have issued orders box if everyone does this maybe we dont have to wait until sunday night to have this resolved im not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units but will be submitting for the 5way draw really enjoyed playing with you all but im exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats,1,True,1,england,russia,1,77,Spring,1908
so im guessing its italy holding out on the draw i figure he proposed it to make the board lazy about collaboration and hes secretly still trying to hit 18 germany and i are collaborating to hold him off until the end,1,,1,england,russia,1,78,Winter,1908
i concur,1,True,-1,russia,england,1,79,Spring,1909
and im trying like hell not to kill austria in the process,1,True,-1,russia,england,1,80,Spring,1909
good luck have you heard from italy at all he hasn‚Äôt responded back to me,1,True,1,england,russia,1,81,Spring,1909
also are you able to cut tyr support to prevent italy from getting to mun,1,True,1,england,russia,1,82,Spring,1909
not necessary but would free up ruh,1,True,1,england,russia,1,83,Spring,1909
nope havent heard a thing from him,1,True,-1,russia,england,1,84,Spring,1909
 yes that doesnt materially change the odds i lose trieste,1,True,-1,russia,england,1,85,Spring,1909
ok great i think things should work out with me and germany holding down the fort he really is close to getting 18 but i don‚Äôt think he can quite get there in time,1,True,1,england,russia,1,86,Spring,1909
hey there  just your friendly neighborhood russian bear here checking in and letting you know communication channels are open   i assume were looking at a standard black sea bounce see how the rest of the spring board looks and going from there,1,True,1,russia,turkey,1,0,Spring,1901
hi yes happy to bounce black sea üåä what are your thoughts on austria,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,1,1,Spring,1901
betrayed  bewildered  wrong answer seriously no real opinion formed yet  he was first to reach out standard fairly neutral greeting and fishing for info noncommittal on plans  beyond bouncing galicia and trying not to anger any of his neighbors  i could go either way on that one  life is a little easier for us if we clear that early so far the only player that strikes me as a bit of a wildcard is italy  i suspect that ones going to move aggressively and erratically once he picks a direction  and that could be good or bad depending,1,,1,russia,turkey,1,2,Spring,1901
ok bounce in the black and let us assess in the fall,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,1,3,Spring,1901
sigh this doesnt seem like the most productive way forward for either of us,1,True,1,russia,turkey,1,4,Fall,1901
i have been playing a lot of gunboat lately,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,1,5,Fall,1901
take romania i will not hinder it in any way,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,1,6,Fall,1901
salut just checking in letting you know the embassy is open and if you decide to move in a direction i might be able to get involved in we can probably come to a reasonable arrangement on cooperation bonne journ√©e,1,True,1,russia,france,1,0,Spring,1901
hey im pretty flexible do you like to open north or against germany,1,True,-1,france,russia,1,1,Spring,1901
not especially  depends on how squirrelly the english player comes off in initial negotiations  so far hes scanning as moderately squirrelly üòÉ,1,True,1,russia,france,1,2,Spring,1901
haha üòÇ moderately squirrelly is pretty accurate,1,True,-1,france,russia,1,3,Spring,1901
checking back in before the deadline its a bit uncertain in the west and it would be interesting to hear about your read,1,True,-1,france,russia,1,4,Spring,1901
looks like italys gonna head away from you pretty aggressively  england still strikes me as squirrelly  he says hes superconcerned about germany but im not sure im buying that,1,True,1,russia,france,1,5,Spring,1901
thanks thats great to hear and is confirming what i have been gathering england is especially hard to read and im not sure i buy that either but at least hes also telling me that he is worried about germany,1,True,-1,france,russia,1,6,Spring,1901
looking good for you since you will be able to pick up sweden the lack of northern german prescence might mean a greater opportunity in scandinavia for you what were your thoughts about turkeys move to armenia,1,,-1,france,russia,1,7,Fall,1901
—Ö—Ä–µ–Ω –∑–Ω–∞–µ—Ç im not thrilled with it to be sure,1,True,1,russia,france,1,8,Fall,1901
i am worried that england and germany are working together which would be bad for both of us i wonder if we can convince england to take denmark perhaps by pointing out the threats in the south and the need to prop you up,1,True,0,france,russia,1,9,Spring,1902
just wanted to say that your moves this turn were really something well played,1,True,0,france,russia,1,10,Spring,1902
you as well looks like you have your territory well defended now,1,True,0,russia,france,1,11,Spring,1902
yeah for sure last season i was in panic mode but it looks like the tables have turned with england choosing to fight germany instead of team up with him,1,True,0,france,russia,1,12,Spring,1902
youre welcome on that one üòÄ,1,True,0,russia,france,1,13,Spring,1902
haha thank you didnt realize you were pulling strings behind the scenes but i really appreciate you doing so,1,True,0,france,russia,1,14,Spring,1902
hey i needed him focused elsewhere than st pete and that was a direction i could help in,1,True,0,russia,france,1,15,Spring,1902
üëç,1,True,0,france,russia,1,16,Spring,1902
im not sure what is happening in the west anymore some of it is due to the bot being down but englands moves were pretty shocking to see any thoughts,1,True,0,france,russia,1,17,Fall,1903
not strong ones i feel like i need to cover my ass but aside from that,1,True,0,russia,france,1,18,Fall,1903
yeah i feel that too with england withdrawing im assuming you are no longer hitting germany with your units unless you have italian help if that is the case i might also stop aggravating germany,1,True,0,france,russia,1,19,Fall,1903
i am not pressing germany this turn,1,,0,russia,france,1,20,Fall,1903
yeah that turn went about as i expected,1,,0,russia,france,1,21,Fall,1903
should we throw to ai,1,True,-1,france,russia,1,22,Spring,1904
maybe  i mean im not opposed,1,True,1,russia,france,1,23,Fall,1904
i am starting to get frustrated with england who has not replied to my messages for over a year while clowning around instead of helping stop the italy austria alliance whats stopping me from throwing is germany asking me not to and then she took belgium lol,1,True,0,france,russia,1,24,Winter,1904
not sure what my game plan is here right now im working on getting germany to build a fleet my theory is that if germany can pivot towards england then it may be a salvageable game eliminating england asap and theres a possibility we can end up in a draw once ai tensions build but that is impossible if they see a weak north full of infighting that they can just roll over then they have no reason to ever turn on eachother,1,True,0,france,russia,1,25,Winter,1904
yep  i have the south stopped cold at this point  and i told austria after the winter turn they would get two and then be stuck  but that means yall gotta work your shit out and lock the other side or this is an ai steamroll,1,True,0,russia,france,1,26,Winter,1904
and if england starts nibbling from behind thisll become the easiest throw ever,1,True,0,russia,france,1,27,Winter,1904
hi turkey wishing you good luck this game wanted to ask what your plans are for relations with russia,1,True,0,england,turkey,1,0,Spring,1901
hi well depends if austria is on board brobably containment,1,True,0,turkey,england,1,1,Spring,1901
that sounds like a good plan russia has indicated to me that theyre looking south so long as i dont cause too much trouble so i would be prepared have you all come to an agreement on the black sea,1,,0,england,turkey,1,2,Spring,1901
it‚Äôs a bounce in the black,1,True,0,turkey,england,1,3,Spring,1901
cool thanks for the info mostly just trying to get a sense for whether you and russia are in cahoots and preparing to mow over the whole board,1,True,0,england,turkey,1,4,Spring,1901
probably not,1,True,0,turkey,england,1,5,Fall,1901
bonjour lets talk about the english channel,1,True,0,england,france,1,0,Spring,1901
sure what are your thoughts on it,1,True,0,france,england,1,1,Spring,1901
id like to leave it unoccupied a fight early on is bad for both of us,1,True,0,england,france,1,2,Spring,1901
makes sense i agree a dmz is good for us both i know that getting armies off of the island is pretty important for you depending on how it plays out we could talk about belgium any thoughts on your other neighbors germany and russia,1,True,0,france,england,1,3,Spring,1901
cool id like to then agree now to a dmz in the channel through the end of 1902 and we can rediscuss that year about future plans are you on board if so will your fleet go to mao  havent heard from germany yet ive been honest with russia about going north and russia has expressed some concerns doesnt want me to bring my army to nwy so belgium may be a home im interested in if thats on the table,1,True,0,england,france,1,4,Spring,1901
wow germany threatens war with me in the first message haha,1,True,0,england,france,1,5,Spring,1901
yes and yes i will open to mao if russia is adamantly against you putting an army in norway it might be worth it to not antagonize him provided that russia and germany are not working together belgium is definitely on the table,1,True,0,france,england,1,6,Spring,1901
interesting haha that is unusual,1,True,0,france,england,1,7,Spring,1901
yeah something tells me that player may be a little unpredictable sounds good on the agreement  for belgium is there something you would want from me for you to give that up are you saying you may consider supporting me in i dont think germany will be thrilled about me being there,1,True,0,england,france,1,8,Spring,1901
yes depending on how the spring plays out i may be in a position to support you into belgium i dont think it would be conditional on something you do but rather if it makes sense given the positions in the fall maybe building an army in london rather than a fleet which likely compliments your goals anyway given the channel dmz i think you are right in that germany would not want to see you in belgium if it will antagonize him anyway it might make sense for us to launch a full out assault in the fall this would probably look like bouncing holland to weaken the german position,1,,0,france,england,1,9,Spring,1901
all of that makes sense lets revisit before the fall orders then i wouldnt be totally opposed to the idea of an attack on germany especially if hes not willing to engage in any meaningful discussion,1,True,0,england,france,1,10,Spring,1901
fyi germany has indicated he is taking his fleet to holland in the spring,1,True,0,england,france,1,11,Spring,1901
thanks for the heads up that is an interesting choice i think it may indicate a russiagermany agreement of some kind as it means russia will be getting sweden,1,True,0,france,england,1,12,Spring,1901
yeah you may be right have you heard from germany at all or russia,1,True,0,england,france,1,13,Spring,1901
i have but nothing much seems like they are withholding information from me,1,,0,france,england,1,14,Spring,1901
yeah im not getting much from them either in a remote game its hard to tell if people are being quiet on purpose or just not making themselves available on the chat this is my first time playing remote so a bit of a different experience for me,1,True,0,england,france,1,15,Spring,1901
yeah that is definitely one of the downsides of online diplomacy by the way were still good with the channel right i know you must be anxious if germany and russia are not talking to you much but i have to stress that this is not because i am working with them and i am not moving to the channel,1,True,0,france,england,1,16,Spring,1901
i am not going to the channel weve agreed to keep out at least through the end of 1902 and i plan to uphold this however that message did make me a little nervous about your plans breaking an explicit agreement like that is cause for war in my book,1,True,0,england,france,1,17,Spring,1901
that wasnt my intention at all and i am very glad that we are on the same page sorry if it came across like i dont trust you i trust you which is why i hoped to bring up any potential worries before they happen i could have worded it better üòÖ ,1,True,0,france,england,1,18,Spring,1901
no worries i did click the thumbs up on your message haha just wanted to be clear about the consequences of a stab,1,True,0,england,france,1,19,Spring,1901
üëç,1,True,0,france,england,1,20,Spring,1901
glad to see our commitment upheld seems like you may have your sights set on belgium,1,True,0,england,france,1,21,Fall,1901
likewise the rest of the map has been interesting whats your read on the map for me i think that a supported attack on belgium is likely the move given the spring turn,1,,0,france,england,1,22,Fall,1901
my read germany gets a pretty good start facing only a bit of aggression from you austria and turkey are likely agreed to stand strong against russia however i think theres a chance that turkey is sort of overselling their opposition to russia moving to arm there may be a juggernaut alliance in the works probably no real conflict between austria and italy maybe theyll bounce in trieste austria has a pretty good start if he can secure greece,1,True,0,england,france,1,23,Fall,1901
do you plan to take belgium from pic or bur,1,True,0,england,france,1,24,Fall,1901
this is all true i think i will likely be taking it from picardy but im not sure yet,1,,0,france,england,1,25,Fall,1901
and here i thought belgium was on the table i guess its already on your plate then whats to stop me from working with the germans to keep you out,1,True,0,england,france,1,26,Fall,1901
belgium is on the table but i didnt expect these spring moves and with the way the map looks i think you need to convince me that it would be worth it for me to be on 4 with you on 5 totally different discussion if italy is in tyrolia or if germany bounced me out of burgundy,1,False,0,france,england,1,27,Fall,1901
im looking at it from your point of view too i think you have options other than belgium right you could take denmark for example,1,False,0,france,england,1,28,Fall,1901
i cant take denmark by force and germany isnt keen on letting me have it the way i see it youll easily take portugal next year assuming you go spain sc with your fleet and that line on picburmar assuming you build there would make you really strong meanwhile im struggling to find a fifth supply center next year russia probably helps out germany with denmark so im looking at st petersburg at that point,1,True,0,england,france,1,29,Fall,1901
what can you offer to balance this out if i let you in,1,True,0,england,france,1,30,Fall,1901
ive had some time to think about it since the bot was down and you are right about concerns over fairness at the end of the day the plan doesnt matter unless you are on board with it if you are going to demand belgium id rather support you in than bounce with you,1,True,0,france,england,1,31,Fall,1901
if you can forgo belgium this turn we do have an opportunity to put you into holland andor denmark next year and that will quickly snowball into scandinavia kiel etc,1,False,0,france,england,1,32,Fall,1901
youre suggesting i get a fleet in nth and hel i think thats the only way to make that work i would want no fleet built in bre and our dmz extended through at least the end of 1903 and probably one other country on board with the takedown if were stabbing germany we should make sure shes taken out swiftly,1,True,0,england,france,1,33,Fall,1901
i think thats the best way to do it yeah i agree to no fleet build in brest and an extension to our dmz to the end of 1903 the one thing i cannot guarantee is another country involved in the take down but the best suspects would likely be russia followed by italy,1,True,0,france,england,1,34,Fall,1901
yeah i was thinking russia this may be something to talk about next year as were running out of time here,1,True,0,england,france,1,35,Fall,1901
cool i am happy to broach the subject when we are ready to especially if this turn goes well he may be more inclined to help next year,1,True,0,france,england,1,36,Fall,1901
hmm what if germany bumps me in nth or hel,1,True,0,england,france,1,37,Fall,1901
i was thinking this and if you supported yourself into the north sea through norway you would just have to worry about being bounced out of hel which i think would be highly unlikely unless the plan is leaked but the other option that is perhaps safer would be to move to skaggerak which germany cant bounce,1,,0,france,england,1,38,Fall,1901
i really dont think its that unlikely that holland fleet has two places to go and i expect it to move assuming a build in kiel germany can bounce in holland to block your entry also i was planning to bring an army to norway so i wouldnt have the support to the north sea,1,True,0,england,france,1,39,Fall,1901
this is too big a risk for me my preferred move is to belgium i understand this may warrant doing a couple of favors for your next year in return but i just feel too exposed otherwise im about to head out for the evening and i have my move set for belgium im hoping for your support into there but i understand if you cant provide it,1,True,0,england,france,1,40,Fall,1901
ok what unit is moving to belgium,1,True,0,france,england,1,41,Fall,1901
the fleet,1,True,0,england,france,1,42,Fall,1901
ok and do you know what germany will do with holland this turn,1,True,0,france,england,1,43,Fall,1901
interesting,1,True,1,france,england,1,44,Winter,1901
yeah i actually botched my move because i forgot to click submit in the browser  not that it would have made a difference hope you‚Äôre enjoying belgium,1,False,-1,england,france,1,45,Winter,1901
i didnt expect to get belgium i incorrectly inferred from all the information i had that germany would support you into belgium and tap burgundy so in order to not lose the support i decided to make burgundy the mover,1,True,1,france,england,1,46,Winter,1901
i mean if anything you are in a better position for not having moved there im surprised it was a misorder youve successfully put germany and i into conflict and can pick off the remains,1,False,1,france,england,1,47,Winter,1901
another note i would have put you into belgium without hesitation if it was an army or if i knew that germany was not planning to support you in with holland,1,False,1,france,england,1,48,Winter,1901
yeah i‚Äôm not really buying that i‚Äôm the big winner here so you can save your breath if you want an ally against germany i‚Äôd like to start hearing some ideas about what that relationship looks like,1,True,-1,england,france,1,49,Winter,1901
not saying you are the big winner im saying that your misorder was probably a good thing before we get into the details of an alliance against germany i think its worth noting that the ai alliance is going to absolutely roll over russiaturkey and so if you take russias dots that are easy to take i think it will be helping germanyaustriaitaly more than it helps you,1,True,1,france,england,1,50,Winter,1901
i really think that we should get russia on board and it should be super easy to do just say that as long as sweden helps you take denmark you wont take stp or sweden for the time being we could even put russia into denmark,1,True,1,france,england,1,51,Winter,1901
i dunno if we actually have so much to work together on if you build fleets and attack the coast ill be distracting all his armies i need to devote all my resources to containing germanys armies anyway i think you guarantee denmark next turn if were clever about it,1,True,1,france,england,1,52,Winter,1901
if germany builds fleet kiel we can support a convoy into holland but i think hell be building armies thats just intuition i havent been able to reach germany and hes hard to talk to,0,False,1,france,england,1,53,Winter,1901
long term i think this looks like a russia holding off austriaitaly with turkey being lepantoed and then if we hit germany hard with russian help then we have a good shot of making it to the midgame and preventing ai from 2way the board,1,True,1,france,england,1,54,Winter,1901
ok ill respond over a few messages so i dont kill the bot,1,True,-1,england,france,1,55,Winter,1901
i agree russia and turkey are in trouble but i think russia is more vulnerable i actually think its possible that turkey and austria are friendly maybe the lepanto will be set up but wont come to fruition if i were to add more pressure in the north i think its a really bad time for russia overall this gives me some leverage in negotiating with russia,1,True,-1,england,france,1,56,Winter,1901
i agree on our limited opportunities for direct collaboration next year however id like to hear what your builds are going to be a fleet in brest would make me worried about you and germany collaborating on an invasion,1,True,-1,england,france,1,57,Winter,1901
how is denmark a guarantee when germany can support from kiel,1,True,-1,england,france,1,58,Winter,1901
ok i think thats all of my messages for now,1,True,-1,england,france,1,59,Winter,1901
its possible but i think austria and turkey are not friendly given the fact that austria did not move serbia to rumania and turkey tried to support that move russia is definitely still in trouble though the target might be turkey first,1,True,1,france,england,1,60,Winter,1901
i have to build armies no fleet in brest,1,True,1,france,england,1,61,Winter,1901
denmark is a guarantee if you can get a fleet into skaggerak and have russia support you in it then becomes a 3v2,1,True,1,france,england,1,62,Winter,1901
you could even do a clever tactic with russia moving to baltic you moving to sweden and skaggeraknorth sea then it is a 4v2,1,True,1,france,england,1,63,Winter,1901
ok so guarantee based on russian collaboration so you dont think russia and germany are friends anymore i suppose they dont have many favors to offer one another,1,True,-1,england,france,1,64,Winter,1901
yeah i think that they are not working together but are simply coexisting,1,,1,france,england,1,65,Winter,1901
im building a fleet in london i hope that doesnt raise any alarms on your end but if you were to build a fleet in bre against your promise any other build would leave me in bad shape i know im being paranoid but im more comfortable with that build,1,True,-1,england,france,1,66,Winter,1901
ok i dont get why you think id build f brest but at the very least i appreciate the heads up at some point id like to see you make a decisive move so far it seems like youve been trying to make moves that both germany and i agree to,1,True,1,france,england,1,67,Winter,1901
you could break  dmz in the channel and coordinate an invasion with germany after building a fleet in brest by building in london i can do everything i might like to do eastward and also i could respond better to a worstcase scenario,1,True,-1,england,france,1,68,Winter,1901
and what would have been my decisive move so far a bump in denmark you were going to support me into belgium so why would i have done that,1,True,-1,england,france,1,69,Winter,1901
sometimes the less options you have the better off you are a lot of diplomacy is signalling,1,True,1,france,england,1,70,Winter,1901
i mean my thinking process last turn was wondering why you didnt go to denmark my conclusion was that germany was probably supporting you to belgium im just telling you the vibes im getting from you,1,True,1,france,england,1,71,Winter,1901
germany was supporting me to belgium and then didnt follow through,1,True,-1,england,france,1,72,Winter,1901
thats really interesting haha,1,True,1,france,england,1,73,Winter,1901
yeah so here i was thinking i had it in the bag and then i first realized i flubbed my move and felt like an idiot and then i looked closer and felt like an accidental genius,1,True,-1,england,france,1,74,Winter,1901
so back to signaling you backed out of your admittedly vague and implied agreement to support me what signal does that send to me are you saying that youre coming for me that i cant totally trust you,1,True,-1,england,france,1,75,Winter,1901
meanwhile ive been totally honest with you for the sake of building trust and a good alliance and youre going to complain about my duplicity,1,True,-1,england,france,1,76,Winter,1901
so i know this is a touchy subject so i want to approach this delicately but to be fair i was still deciding whether i would support you or not when you logged out for the night i dont want to devolve this into what about when you did this thing that wasnt the best signal but one of the things for me was considering why you werent willing to move to denmark sure you want belgium but what does that mean for me when you want to put a fleet in belgium and not an army what is the followup play,1,True,1,france,england,1,77,Winter,1901
i am not complaining about your duplicity im complaining that were missing opportunities to make strong progress because i think you arent committed to working with me but you arent committed to working with germany either i think you would agree that had you worked with only germany from the start or worked with only me from the start youd be in a much better position yeah,1,,1,france,england,1,78,Winter,1901
yeah thats all fair the timing thing makes remote play kind of weird when theres a lapse in communication before an important move we didnt really have a chance to talk about the fleet vs army there,1,True,-1,england,france,1,79,Winter,1901
but i dont get why you dont think ive been working with you you proposed two possibilities belgium or hollanddenmark in 1902 i expressed my preference after raising some concerns about germanys ability to counter hollanddenmark you agreed to help me to belgium,1,True,-1,england,france,1,80,Winter,1901
if you think commitment to a sole country is a good strategy why havent you followed it would you agree that ive been more committed to working with you than you have with me thats pretty clear from your moves last turn,1,True,-1,england,france,1,81,Winter,1901
all great points and i agree with you on a lot of this i was very willing to support you to belgium but i should have made it more clear that it needed to be an army i do believe commitment is a good strategy which is what led me to some admittedly antigerman opening moves im not saying you have not shown commitment after all we have an excellent dmz in the channel but it does bug me a bit that i cannot identify something you have done to antagonize germany,1,True,1,france,england,1,82,Winter,1901
well what would you like me to do to show this antagonism next year make the goal to secure denmark,1,True,-1,england,france,1,83,Winter,1901
yes i would very much love to see that and the best part is that you get to see my super friendly builds before you decide on anything,1,True,1,france,england,1,84,Winter,1901
alright this sounds good lets reconvene after builds then thats monday at noon right its probably time for me to get back to real life here haha,1,True,-1,england,france,1,85,Winter,1901
sounds great me too haha,1,True,1,france,england,1,86,Winter,1901
thoughts on builds,1,True,1,france,england,1,87,Spring,1902
yours were indeed friendly which i appreciate germanys were what i expected i thought russia might have build in st p but i guess theres enough going on in the south to warrant the warsaw build the italian naples fleet is consistent with the lepanto but then again whats the alternative build army in rome also i wonder if austriaitaly are eyeing munich this year,1,,-1,england,france,1,88,Spring,1902
i have similar thoughts i think that russia and turkey are both in a weak spot and all the evidence so far points towards them getting involved in a long and drawn out conflict im sure russia would have loved to build st petersburg but couldnt afford to now he is pretty much completely under your good graces austria and italy may very well team up to take munich,1,True,1,france,england,1,89,Spring,1902
germanys builds have come out to be very antifrench so i am sure you are happy about those as well it comes at the cost of cutting down the amount of options he has significantly what do you think germany might order,1,True,1,france,england,1,90,Spring,1902
trying to get a sense of the german plan now i feel like germany has to play defense unless they did something like mun to ruh to support into bel or bur to gas to put pressure on bre in the fall,1,True,-1,england,france,1,91,Spring,1902
yeah i do to i was thinking that my best play might be to ignore burgundy and hope it holds and instead go for something annoying like holland or ruhr which would leave him to either withdraw to defend or leave himself prone in the north of course it could backfire if hes thinking the same thing and ends up in gascony,0,True,1,france,england,1,92,Spring,1902
im trying to reason through how that plays out suppose germany supports bur to ruh with bel then you cant penetrate right,1,True,-1,england,france,1,93,Spring,1902
yes if he moves bur to ruhr with support i cant get in but it would also mean hes out of burgundy which is good for me and means if i retake burgundy that i can start applying pressure to ruhr and munich,1,True,1,france,england,1,94,Spring,1902
if he moves kiel to ruhr he leaves all sorts of things completely exposed like denmark and if he leaves munich he leaves that open as well,1,True,1,france,england,1,95,Spring,1902
yeah germany is in a tough spot any word from italy in all this im guessing the lepanto is the focus but a move to either pie or tyr would be kind of taking a side,1,True,-1,england,france,1,96,Spring,1902
true he said he was thinking about it but not sure how much i can trust that hed certainly want to obscure moving to piedmont if that is his plan,1,True,1,france,england,1,97,Spring,1902
i know channel is tempting if you think it might work id totally support you to holland or i can tap holland to make sure it cant leave by going to helgoland without losing it moving to helgoland or skaggerak yourself can also be a strong play especially if germany thinks you are on his side a move to skagg can be explained as a move on russia and a move to helgoland is deadly if it succeeds,1,True,1,france,england,1,98,Spring,1902
pinging you since deadline is approaching,1,True,1,france,england,1,99,Spring,1902
whatever you decide dont break our dmz in the channel its not worth it i guarantee you that,1,True,1,france,england,1,100,Spring,1902
the dmz stands id like confirmation from you that it stays through the end of 1903,1,True,-1,england,france,1,101,Spring,1902
confirmed,1,True,1,france,england,1,102,Spring,1902
hopefully that got to you on time üò¨,1,True,1,france,england,1,103,Spring,1902
yeah im here im moving to nth and hel holding in the others,1,True,-1,england,france,1,104,Spring,1902
id like one of holland or denmark this year both would be nice but maybe not feasible,1,True,-1,england,france,1,105,Spring,1902
lets see germanys spring moves and restrategize,1,True,-1,england,france,1,106,Spring,1902
sounds great,1,True,1,france,england,1,107,Spring,1902
i will go to ruhr then to apply some pressure there hopefully ill make the right guesses when it comes to what germany will do with burgundy i believe that we can get you denmark or holland but it may require some clever manuevering in the fall,1,True,1,france,england,1,108,Spring,1902
are you selfbouncing in gas to prevent the move there,1,True,-1,england,france,1,109,Spring,1902
thats a great option i might change my moves to that actually i have something more risky in mind at the moment though,1,True,1,france,england,1,110,Spring,1902
nice that worked out really well actually well done on taking the helgoland blight that was a great call and it means we can guarantee holland for you next turn burgundy might retreat to marseilles which is annoying but manageable  or it could retreat to munich very interesting that russia made an aggressive move towards you,1,True,1,france,england,1,111,Spring,1902
nah that was planned russias trying to keep good graces with germany before helping me to denmark in the fall i cant do this if im going for holland though,1,True,-1,england,france,1,112,Spring,1902
im a little surprised austria and italy are totally staying out the fight i guess theyre really going for turkey,1,True,-1,england,france,1,113,Spring,1902
even better if russia is helping you with denmark i can apply some pressure on ruhr and cracking that key position means that on the next turn we start threatening home centers like kiel and will be in excellent shape to tackle holland on the next year depends how much you trust russia seems like hes been radio silent for me but then again we dont have a lot to talk about,1,True,1,france,england,1,114,Spring,1902
yeah the moves in the east are pretty crazy actually they are going hard against turkey and russia made some excellent moves it looks like so turkey is in a very tough spot,1,True,1,france,england,1,115,Spring,1902
agreed were in good shape though i imagine after these moves germany will make a hard play for russian support if i can indeed trust russia ill convoy an army from norway to denmark and cut support from kiel with hel,1,True,-1,england,france,1,116,Spring,1902
i wonder if theres anything to offer russia to sweeten the deal,1,True,-1,england,france,1,117,Spring,1902
great points i think russia may plan to further develop in the south especially if he and italy work something out against austria or if austria and he work something out against italy if thats the case he may just want the peace of mind that you are not going to attack him for a while otherwise probably a german dot if he plans to play in the north,1,True,1,france,england,1,118,Spring,1902
looking back at the map probably berlin would be the best bet for a dot offer since russia could take that with an army after traveling to prussiasilesia from warsaw or with the fleet in sweden by traveling to the baltic first,1,True,1,france,england,1,119,Spring,1902
yeah thats what i was thinking russia seems fine to support without it,1,True,-1,england,france,1,120,Spring,1902
poor germany she said shes a firsttimer,1,True,-1,england,france,1,121,Spring,1902
indeed though i remember the people who i played with in my first few games were more than happy to introduce me to the game with some brutal stabs üòÇ,1,,1,france,england,1,122,Spring,1902
nice that went well,1,True,1,france,england,1,123,Winter,1902
sorry for the late notice just a heads up that i plan to build a fleet in brest but will park it in the mao as a deterrent to italy,1,False,1,france,england,1,124,Winter,1902
can you explain why you didn‚Äôt build it in mar,1,True,-1,england,france,1,125,Spring,1903
yeah sure i couldnt build it in marseilles because there would be very little i could tell italy to persuade him that i wasnt planning to attack him with that build even though that isnt my intention,1,False,1,france,england,1,126,Spring,1903
whats the plan on the german front maybe we can get creative with the moves in a way that gets both of us at least one dot im not holding myy breath on ruhr so i think the best play might be to send belgium to holland with support from the north sea while denmark hits kiel with support from helgoland if germany makes similar moves to her last turn we would pop both kiel and holland and would guarantee munichberlin for next year if germany supports kiel instead of moving to ruhr then we would guarantee kiel in the fall as id walk into ruhr and we would have ruhr holland helgoland and denmark for a 4v3,1,True,1,france,england,1,127,Spring,1903
interesting to see you in the english channel,1,True,1,france,england,1,128,Fall,1903
so,1,True,1,france,england,1,129,Fall,1903
you want to leave the channel i can leave you alone so that you can do that,0,True,1,france,england,1,130,Fall,1903
not sure where all of this is coming from honesty i know you feel bad for germany since its her first game but for all you know she could just be lying about that for an advantage if thats why you arent talking to me then id ask that you consider playing the board and not who you think everyone is,1,True,1,france,england,1,131,Fall,1903
based on the redacted profile this is her second game on backstabbr her moves have been tactically excellent,1,True,1,france,england,1,132,Fall,1903
test,1,True,1,france,england,1,133,Spring,1904
given that you are still submitting orders it seems like you are reading my messages and choosing not to respond,1,True,1,france,england,1,134,Spring,1904
give me a reason to defend myself against italy as it stands im just going to let him solo,1,False,1,france,england,1,135,Spring,1904
look i will defend myself against italy but i need to know that i will be in the draw if you and germany are just going to fuck me from behind then there is no incentive for me to defend myself against italy,1,False,1,france,england,1,136,Spring,1904
i know you are upset with me we can fix this but i need to know why,1,,0,france,england,1,137,Winter,1904
italy is the highest ranked online player on playdiplomacycom they will solo if we dont stop them now once italy marches through france they are just going to continue onwards and attack you and your friend germany,1,True,0,france,england,1,138,Spring,1905
whatever italyaustria told you about me and what ive said is a lie youre being stringed along and they will kill you as soon as they kill me their entire goal is to get us to fight thats why italy keeps trying to get me to go to the north atlantic ocean and why they constantly told me to take english channel which i ignored,1,False,0,france,england,1,139,Spring,1905
why do you want to kill me so badly,1,True,0,france,england,1,140,Spring,1905
whatever i did im sorry,1,False,0,france,england,1,141,Fall,1905
i can stop italy this turn by the way its pretty easy since italy let me into marseilles i can support the hold in marseilles and marseilles can support mao to spain sc its impossible to breach ive checked it and i can keep making those orders for years and years you stabbed me in spring 03 it is fall 05 i think that you italy and germany are highly underestimating my ability to survive against your onslaught you sure this is the game you want slowly whittling away at me until i die instead i propose that we let you into the mid atlantic ocean and that you help me defend italy i can send you past the mao into west med where you can start taking dots like tunis or naples we wait until ai crumbles and you have an excellent game where you top the board,0,False,0,france,england,1,142,Fall,1905
hey want to talk,1,True,-4,france,england,1,143,Spring,1907
old friend sure why not,1,True,4,england,france,1,144,Spring,1907
awesome im reaching out because were entering the late game and i think italy is making a push to solo i think it may be time to take swedenst petersburg and get austria to turn on italy,1,True,-4,france,england,1,145,Fall,1907
im just one unit so i cant do much unfortunately and likely will be soon eliminated maybe you can still turn the tides i wonder how you feel about italy after this last turn,1,True,-4,france,england,1,146,Fall,1907
yeah it was a pretty brutal stab from italy would be happy to see him go down do you have thoughts on your remaining unit,1,True,4,england,france,1,147,Fall,1907
i would be happy to use it however it would help,1,True,-4,france,england,1,148,Fall,1907

nice work with burgundy my dude  can you support me into marseilles next turn,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,80,Fall,1902
i still have no idea what england and france are up to,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,81,Fall,1902
then i can support you into france further using marseilles as a base to support your advances  lmk  looking forward to talking this through,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,82,Fall,1902
hey amigo you around at all,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,83,Fall,1902
yeah sorry on a work trip,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,84,Fall,1902
no worries man  if now is good to talk lmk,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,85,Fall,1902
not now but soon,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,86,Fall,1902
rgr just lmk,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,87,Fall,1902
can talk now,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,88,Fall,1902
updated my orders to support you,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,89,Fall,1902
ok so i‚Äôd really like your support for my army in piedmont into marseilles  thoughts,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,90,Fall,1902
already did it,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,91,Fall,1902
my man  rest assured you‚Äôll get plenty of the france pie too when his house starts to crumble,1,,-1,italy,germany,2,92,Fall,1902
anything i can do for you in the here and now tho,1,,-1,italy,germany,2,93,Fall,1902
yeah i‚Äôm more worried about the limey brits rn,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,94,Fall,1902
let me look at the board but i don‚Äôt think so,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,95,Fall,1902
i think he‚Äôs sympatico to our antifrance agendahe said earlier he‚Äôs been trying to reach you  i bet he‚Äôd be down to discuss,1,,-1,italy,germany,2,96,Fall,1902
and ok just lmk,1,,-1,italy,germany,2,97,Fall,1902
he‚Äôs a little salty with me for the belgium thing,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,98,Fall,1902
mhmm yeah i see that  but idk if he‚Äôd be salty enough to ally with france after last turn,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,99,Fall,1902
do what you want but my unsolicited advice is to try to work out a compromise he could really give you a bad day if he feels like it,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,100,Fall,1902
yeah i don‚Äôt want to fuck him or russia but it would be silly to not take a sc in scandinavia,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,101,Fall,1902
russia is very weak england is strong at ultimately a long term threat to me,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,102,Fall,1902
you ain‚Äôt wrong  but it might be to your advantage to find a way to live with england for at least the next few turns imho,1,,-1,italy,germany,2,103,Fall,1902
what does that look like,1,,1,germany,italy,2,104,Fall,1902
my idea is to enlist russia to support ska into norway,1,,1,germany,italy,2,105,Fall,1902
promise russia non aggression so i can focus on england and france,1,,1,germany,italy,2,106,Fall,1902
take the north sea last year and begin my land invasion,1,,1,germany,italy,2,107,Fall,1902
so if i‚Äôm you i do different i knock russia and france out then hit england if that must happen,1,,-1,italy,germany,2,108,Fall,1902
how do i benefit from letting him get stronger or even survive i don‚Äôt see it germany wins usually through an early england knock out usually allied with france,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,109,Fall,1902
i mean it‚Äôs england‚Äôs call here but if i was him i‚Äôd just want a not to lose builds and b not to lose my foothold on the continent  maybe you can offer him that maybe you can‚Äôt,1,False,-1,italy,germany,2,110,Fall,1902
how do i benefit from helping him tho,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,111,Fall,1902
i just think england  france is too many fish to fry even with my help but eh what do i know it‚Äôs your call,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,112,Fall,1902
that‚Äôs my question i just don‚Äôt see it,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,113,Fall,1902
you get france out earlier and get builds from that,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,114,Fall,1902
that‚Äôs why you want to work with england in the short term imho,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,115,Fall,1902
he‚Äôll want paris,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,116,Fall,1902
but i won‚Äôt get builds from france is the thing,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,117,Fall,1902
i don‚Äôt believe for a second i‚Äôm going to get the last one on the coast of the english channel or what something in the iberian peninsula,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,118,Fall,1902
you want mar,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,119,Fall,1902
i just don‚Äôt see how i benefit from working with england,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,120,Fall,1902
other than he seems like a solid dude,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,121,Fall,1902
i think if you‚Äôre assertive and you play it right you can get plenty,1,False,-1,italy,germany,2,122,Fall,1902
you hold the cards here he doesn‚Äôt,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,123,Fall,1902
thatcsaid it‚Äôs your hand to play,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,124,Fall,1902
yoooo there‚Äôs no way you can help england take paris,1,,-1,italy,germany,2,125,Fall,1902
unless i switch bur to supporting him,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,126,Fall,1902
he asked me and i told him i‚Äôm already supporting you,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,127,Fall,1902
are you going to take smyrna,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,128,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm attempting a deal with england right now,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,129,Fall,1902
yeahhh he may just be out in the cold this turn,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,130,Fall,1902
yeah plz still support me to marseilles obviously lol,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,131,Fall,1902
england may be,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,132,Fall,1902
yeah,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,133,Fall,1902
i mean aside from the fact that you promised to support me into marseilles it obviously makes more sense for you to help me out than england,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,134,Fall,1902
of course,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,135,Fall,1902
yeah england is telling me y‚Äôall couldn‚Äôt reach a deal,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,136,Fall,1902
bummer but i get it,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,137,Fall,1902
i can‚Äôt agree to a deal where he keeps the north sea i just can‚Äôt have two armies sitting around doing nothing to be this guys friend,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,138,Fall,1902
fair enough my dude,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,139,Fall,1902
did you know austria is apparently one of the top ranked players in the world,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,140,Fall,1902
lol yeah,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,141,Fall,1902
wild,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,142,Fall,1902
how‚Äôd you get roped into this game,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,143,Fall,1902
a friend of mine is doing this study,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,144,Fall,1902
hbu,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,145,Fall,1902
same lol,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,146,Fall,1902
with an all out war with england breaking out things might get hairy,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,147,Fall,1902
yeah,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,148,Fall,1902
i want to avoid that at all costs,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,149,Fall,1902
but you‚Äôve got to play your game,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,150,Fall,1902
what‚Äôs your long term plan maybe you can help mediate,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,151,Fall,1902
ugh so i‚Äôll tell you the offer i made him,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,152,Fall,1902
ok man this is what i‚Äôm gonna propose if you attack paris and i take marseilles and i mean what else are you really gonna do with that army i will fight like hell to give you two builds during france‚Äôs collapse,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,153,Fall,1902
like imho we need to separate north sea from the france question,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,154,Fall,1902
if we don‚Äôt steal a build from france here we waste valuable time,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,155,Fall,1902
france doesn‚Äôt threaten me directly tho i would probably be allied with him if the guy was more chatty,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,156,Fall,1902
eh if he decides to make moves he could threaten any of us,1,,-1,italy,germany,2,157,Fall,1902
and that‚Äôs the thing he‚Äôs not talkative or communicative  ergo he is a bad ally,1,,-1,italy,germany,2,158,Fall,1902
talks breaking down between me and england almost guarantees france the channel i offered an armistice in the north sea no fleet there which would give us bother protection,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,159,Fall,1902
can i mediate between you two,1,,-1,italy,germany,2,160,Fall,1902
what is this north sea dispute,1,,-1,italy,germany,2,161,Fall,1902
we are talking about an armistice now talks are being reopened,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,162,Fall,1902
rgr i stand ready to support,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,163,Fall,1902
after france what‚Äôs next,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,164,Fall,1902
that‚Äôs a big question my dude and i‚Äôm open to your thoughts,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,165,Fall,1902
i kinda want early game to shake out before making tough decisions,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,166,Fall,1902
understood we have to see what this anglogerman alliance holds,1,True,1,germany,italy,2,167,Fall,1902
i‚Äôll just say that i consider you my close ally and have every intention of finishing this game that way,1,True,-1,italy,germany,2,168,Fall,1902

by him doing this gambit,1,,-3,italy,germany,2,293,Spring,1905
‚Äúyou thought we had trust that is the mirage of diplomacy‚Äù,1,True,3,germany,italy,2,294,Spring,1905
how allied with england are you,1,True,-3,italy,germany,2,295,Spring,1905
well i thought we were strong af but idk now based on what you and austria are telling me,1,True,3,germany,italy,2,296,Spring,1905
strong af as in willing to end the game together,1,True,-3,italy,germany,2,297,Spring,1905
nah idk about that but strong enough to leave parts of our borders undefended,1,True,3,germany,italy,2,298,Spring,1905
strong enough he let me take the north sea,1,True,3,germany,italy,2,299,Spring,1905
ok,1,True,-3,italy,germany,2,300,Spring,1905
what does a good endgame look like to you,1,True,-3,italy,germany,2,301,Spring,1905
i‚Äôve lost a lottt of respect for austria bc of this shit,1,True,-3,italy,germany,2,302,Spring,1905

well me and england are only committed to taking out austria,1,True,3,germany,italy,2,307,Spring,1905

i mostly indicated my openness because i would feel more comfortable having a total and complete ally,1,True,3,germany,italy,2,309,Spring,1905

three way shares victory,1,True,-3,italy,germany,2,315,Spring,1905
me not attacking him until austria is gone,1,True,3,germany,italy,2,316,Spring,1905

gah i‚Äôm italy fuck everything,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,0,Spring,1901
let‚Äôs talk my dude  i think an initial ceasefire for this first turn or maybe longer may be in both of our advantages  what‚Äôre you thinking,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,1,Spring,1901
i tend to agree i would rather move east here and im fine with some sort of lepanto,1,False,0,austria,italy,2,2,Spring,1901
slow day at work so im free if you want to talk a bit  ive sent one message to turkey and heard nothing yet so i dont feel super great rn,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,3,Spring,1901
hey italy would love to talk strategy if youre free for a bit,1,,0,austria,italy,2,4,Spring,1901
hey man super sorry about earlier can‚Äôt talk at work earlier message was sent on my lunch break lol but i‚Äôm free now,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,5,Spring,1901
what‚Äôre you thinking re strategy,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,6,Spring,1901
no worries it happens  i hadnt gotten any messages from anyone so i was a little frustrated  glad that you at least are responsive,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,7,Spring,1901
i reached out to turkey about an alliance but havent heard from him  if hes going to be an unresponsive ally i dont want to work with him and im fine with taking him on ideally with your help  i think the two of us would do well together,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,8,Spring,1901
you ever do a blue water lepanto,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,9,Spring,1901
i won‚Äôt be responsive at all during work hours just fyi but i promise to make up for it by being extra responsive when i‚Äôm off work haha,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,10,Spring,1901
i have not  what‚Äôre you thinking  i‚Äôm fine with going ‚Äúfull kimono‚Äù with you as it wereobviously one of my builds needs to be tunis where do you think build 2 comes from,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,11,Spring,1901
this is also my first time playing as italy so idk what i‚Äôm doing lol,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,12,Spring,1901
so you probably wont get two builds this round because the only sc in reach mine and i wont love it if you attack me early üòÇüòÇ,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,13,Spring,1901
but tunis is a great call here and you can set yourself up to move into a good position against turkey while also taking tunis,1,False,0,austria,italy,2,14,Spring,1901
i would love to see you moving against france here so we can build a solid foundation to expand outward from eventually my dream is to dmz the venicetrieste area,1,False,0,austria,italy,2,15,Spring,1901
what‚Äôs the blue water lepanto tho,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,16,Spring,1901
i am skeptical of france,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,17,Spring,1901
he had been uncommunicative,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,18,Spring,1901
yeah same with everyone else for me england has talked a bit  im fully committed to you right now and im hoping you feel the same way,1,False,0,austria,italy,2,19,Spring,1901
the lepanto moveset is a austroitalian moveset against turkey,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,20,Spring,1901
the bluewater makes it more difficult for turkey to see the attack coming and thus defend it,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,21,Spring,1901
its my goto opening as austria or as italy working with austria,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,22,Spring,1901
i‚Äôll be honest i‚Äôm pretty close to saying fuck it and going all in with you hahaha,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,23,Spring,1901
i mean if i get out of the game we i‚Äôm italy and i‚Äôm super busy at work i have low expectations,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,24,Spring,1901
would be happy to hear that im all in rn,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,25,Spring,1901
having a relatively committed ally is all i ask,1,,0,austria,italy,2,26,Spring,1901
in the words of the fyre festival guy ‚Äúlets just do it and be legends man‚Äù,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,27,Spring,1901
its hard to express how poor this level of diplomacy is rn,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,28,Spring,1901
i havent lied nor recieved a lie as far as im aware,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,29,Spring,1901
so you‚Äôve played diplomacy a lot then,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,30,Spring,1901
quite a bit  do you know who i am,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,31,Spring,1901

i‚Äôm probably going easy build with tunis unless you think greece is an option for me,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,100,Fall,1901
go for tunis idk if greece is guaranteed yet  russia is a dumbass but i told him to do that  he and turkey are pretty new and i could take them both myself if you want to move on france,1,False,0,austria,italy,2,101,Fall,1901

i put a bit of time into that relationship but whatever,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,104,Fall,1901
what relationship,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,105,Fall,1901
you have to play this safe  im honestly thinking of covering tri here just in case i dont need rum yet,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,106,Fall,1901
turkey and russia,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,107,Fall,1901

yeah i‚Äôm not making moves oh truest obviously,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,109,Fall,1901
on trieste,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,110,Fall,1901
that buys me a build at the expense of fucking me in the medium term not even long term lol,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,111,Fall,1901
yeah im not sure that would be a great idea for either of us,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,112,Fall,1901
any advice on what i should do with that army,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,113,Fall,1901
i would love to see you push france but im obviously biased of course  at the least if you would move it away from tri i would be obliged,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,114,Fall,1901
what do you want germany to do here  help you take on france or stay well out of the area so you can take most of him yourself,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,115,Fall,1901
hmmm a few thoughts,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,116,Fall,1901
shoot,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,117,Fall,1901
i want something for moving away from trieste  can we go ahead and make triestevenice a dmz until further notice,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,118,Fall,1901
full warning you‚Äôre positioning for a lot of builds so i‚Äôm obviously a little wary of a super strong austria right up in my biznass,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,119,Fall,1901
absolutely thats my intent,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,120,Fall,1901
im not taking rum this turn and im planning to make turkey mad  those are both true,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,121,Fall,1901
you can trust me  i really have too much potential in the east to want to piss off the only true ally ill have by 1902,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,122,Fall,1901
ok so none of my armiesnavies in venice after this build none of yours in trieste  done deal,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,123,Fall,1901
second yeah i want germany‚Äôs help with france with the uk going elsewhere i need something to distract france  what‚Äôve your discussions with germany been like,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,124,Fall,1901
i may in the future need to build a fleet in tri to attack turkey  ill let you know when and you can respond with a build in kind,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,125,Fall,1901
i dont have any other coastal provinces so my options are limited,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,126,Fall,1901
rgr  i just need prior notification that i have the chance to see and acknowledge,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,127,Fall,1901
thats fine for me,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,128,Fall,1901
thanks for being agreeable,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,129,Fall,1901
no worries,1,,0,italy,austria,2,130,Fall,1901
ok here are my goals for this turn germany cant let russia into sweden this turn but germany and russia need to partner up against england in the future  have england attack france this turn and you finish france off,1,,0,austria,italy,2,131,Fall,1901
heres the way this will play out,1,,0,austria,italy,2,132,Fall,1901
england will move aggressively on france pulling frances attention northward while you come in  a weak russia and germany will move on england afterward reversing the course of englands fleets and staving off his attack on france  france who committed defensively to the north will not be able to ward you off and you can slide in  england will be next and russia is falling around this time as well  germany will be left and we can figure out a plan from there,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,133,Fall,1901
this stays between you can me  im not in the mood for message forwards right now,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,134,Fall,1901
rgr  you can trust me,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,135,Fall,1901
only issue i have is how can england attack france  he can go to belgium but why would he and that isn‚Äôt that bad for france,1,,0,italy,austria,2,136,Fall,1901
england should be wanting belgium,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,137,Fall,1901
if the two of us plus germany convince him to take on france hell take on france,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,138,Fall,1901
is he tho  have you talked to him,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,139,Fall,1901
diplomacy players are like sheep and will follow the crowd  two is a crown if played effectively,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,140,Fall,1901
yep,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,141,Fall,1901
working on him right now,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,142,Fall,1901
hmmm lemme know what he sayshe hasn‚Äôt talked to me yet,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,143,Fall,1901
no this on is on you now  you need to get germany to ask england to hit france with the two of you,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,144,Fall,1901
england will comply,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,145,Fall,1901
hokay will try,1,,0,italy,austria,2,146,Fall,1901
the real trick is keeping russia busy with germany for one turn,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,147,Fall,1901
any ideas what i should do with my apulia army,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,148,Fall,1901

im really not trying to control you  this is just a pretty straightforward game if we play it right and italyaustria rarely pull a good game out together so i am excited about our chances,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,154,Fall,1901
dude i am aok with taking adviceguidance from you and being the junior partner hahaha,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,155,Fall,1901
awesome  lets steamroll this game,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,156,Fall,1901
at the point where france is unwilling to partner you‚Äôre my best chance for making it to late game  any backstab of you is so clearly not in my mediumlong term interests hahaha,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,157,Fall,1901
and vice versa  im not in the mood of wrecking this game over a dumb stab,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,158,Fall,1901

what‚Äôre you thinking for moves  right now i‚Äôm planning to send my fleets towards turkey and make a move for marseilles hoping to bounce then move my army in tunis forward but i‚Äôm curious what your thoughts are and how i can plug into your strategy,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,232,Spring,1902
both seem good  id split the fleets one west and one east but thats just me,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,233,Spring,1902
i assume you‚Äôre going full court press on turkey,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,234,Spring,1902
thats true,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,235,Spring,1902
while keeping russia in my pocket,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,236,Spring,1902
and france,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,237,Spring,1902
france is saying he doesn‚Äôt want wari think england is down to get him but idk what germany is feeling  i‚Äôm divided between going all in on turkey vice dividing my efforts between him and france,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,238,Spring,1902
i‚Äôm probably not getting more than one build out of turkey am i,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,239,Spring,1902
russia wants something out of this too and soon there will be very little turkey for anyone,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,240,Spring,1902
turkey will be a tough nut to crack and i want to be honest and say i dont know  youll definitely get a build but i dont want you to have to overcommit that way,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,241,Spring,1902
so long as i get one build i‚Äôm a happy camper,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,242,Spring,1902
ill do my best to make that happen,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,243,Spring,1902
because ultimately starving you out of a build would make you turn on me eventually  you can know im telling the truth about giving you builds because i dont want you to fall far behind and become jealous of the growth of your neighbors  does that make sense,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,244,Spring,1902
nah i‚Äôm with it,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,245,Spring,1902
i trust you,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,246,Spring,1902

heading down into the adriatic here  trying to contain turkey,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,253,Spring,1902

yeahgermany is telling me he thinks france and england are allies  would be bad,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,256,Spring,1902
in all honesty for the pressure  i have no plans to lie to you but if you happened to support turkey into greece or something i would have options to respond in the fall,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,257,Spring,1902
fair enough man  that said that makes me a bit worried about a stab right before build phase  anything i can offer you to not do that,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,258,Spring,1902
send that second fleet towards france and we should be fine üòâ i think you were planning on that anyway so that shouldnt be too much of a pain,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,259,Spring,1902

yep  good clarification,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,264,Spring,1902
yeeeee let‚Äôs do the damn thing my man,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,265,Spring,1902

the best part is that ven and tri are successfully dmz,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,270,Fall,1902

right,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,297,Fall,1902
so i‚Äôm trying to finesse that,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,298,Fall,1902
but if youre going to lyo you get it no matter what,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,299,Fall,1902
in spring,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,300,Fall,1902
we‚Äôll see if i am successful and we‚Äôll see if france is smart enough to make that play,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,301,Fall,1902
and youll get smy for certain in 1903,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,302,Fall,1902
yeah england may be looking strong,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,303,Fall,1902
so honestly i was thinking that i‚Äôd go into wes instead to convoy that army into spain later,1,,-1,italy,austria,2,304,Fall,1902
do you think that‚Äôs dumb  i just don‚Äôt like it just chilling in tunis,1,,-1,italy,austria,2,305,Fall,1902
hahaha excellent,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,306,Fall,1902
why did russia hold in moscow  makes no sense,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,307,Fall,1902
hes not great ,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,308,Fall,1902
your wes idea works out well lol,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,309,Fall,1902
lol thank you calculated risk but it paid off,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,310,Fall,1902
you see england‚Äôs order to picardy tosupport a french attack from paris to burgundy  i fear we‚Äôre seeing a frenchengland axis emerge after all,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,311,Fall,1902
do you think you could put a word in france‚Äôs ear about what unit he should disband,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,312,Fall,1902
also looking at this game germany is about to be very strong do you trust him  he‚Äôs my second tier ally after you but idk if he‚Äôd start going after you,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,313,Fall,1902
hes not going after me  i set him up against england  hell be busy for a while,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,314,Fall,1902
you told england to do that  or you told germany to go after england,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,315,Fall,1902
also when you can whatrecyou thinking re upcoming builds,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,316,Fall,1902
i told both to attack each other  very truthfully of course  the point is to get germany to distract england from helping you and keep g busy fighting a war it will take a while to win,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,317,Fall,1902
by the time g is done with england you and i will have turned around and will be ready to move against him,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,318,Fall,1902
lol we should have deconflicted i spent a lot of time last night trying to get england and germany to play nice at least few the next turn  i assume you don‚Äôt want england to help me bc you don‚Äôt want me to get too strong,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,319,Fall,1902
england and france were allied  im thinking long term about our strategy england wont help you as evidenced by the fact that even after you spent a long time talking to him last night he still supported france against you,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,320,Fall,1902
think big picture here about how things will play out after you finish off france  this isnt about you getting too strong its about germany getting too strong,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,321,Fall,1902
no no i support your play here,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,322,Fall,1902
gotcha i trust you and want to see you succeed ,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,323,Fall,1902
just your phrasing ‚Äúget germany to distract england from helping you‚Äù i thought i‚Äôd ask about it,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,324,Fall,1902
gotcha i trust you and want to see you succeed lets do this,0,True,1,austria,italy,2,325,Fall,1902
no no same  this is working out real well all things considered,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,326,Fall,1902

im typing a little too fast at work and im a bit distracted üòÇüòÇ,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,328,Fall,1902
ah see i figured something like that  we good homie,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,329,Fall,1902
no worries my dude  i‚Äôm free to talk builds whenever but we can wait until later today just lmk,1,,-1,italy,austria,2,330,Fall,1902
turkey took his back so ill probably just go a vie,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,331,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm divided on army rome or fleet napoli feels like the southern oceans are a bit crowded and another navy is overkill welcome your thoughts but i won‚Äôt build anything in venice üòâ,1,,-1,italy,austria,2,332,Fall,1902
im fine with either  you may struggle to fully take the iberian without another fleet and you have that one army in tunis to bring to bear on the mainland,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,333,Fall,1902
supporting you into smyrna this turn can you do the same for me into con in the fall,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,334,Winter,1902
assuming i get into smyrna of course done deal  you can count on it,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,335,Winter,1902
amazing  this is such a great start,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,336,Winter,1902
all out enemies are focused elsewhere really the perfect setup,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,337,Winter,1902
i miss diplomacy so much  im normally too busy with the nexus to play actual games and ive recused myself from tournament games so im not accused of conflict of interest,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,338,Winter,1902
but that means i dont play as often as id like,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,339,Winter,1902
glad we can get some good diplomacy time in for yah my dude üòÉ,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,340,Winter,1902

this is the best week to be free  game will get slow as we pull ahead,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,342,Winter,1902
i planned it that way clearly üòâ,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,343,Winter,1902
do you think it makes sense for you to put a word in france‚Äôs ear on what unit he should disband,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,344,Winter,1902
go for it,0,True,1,austria,italy,2,345,Winter,1902
no i mean for you to do it hahaha he won‚Äôt trust me and we don‚Äôt have that relationship,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,346,Winter,1902

which unit you want gone,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,348,Winter,1902
im usually not that forceful  id be a lot more subtle  theres a million ways to do it and that tactic wouldnt work here,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,349,Winter,1902
yeah i can,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,350,Winter,1902
oh lol,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,351,Winter,1902
i mean if that fleet in mao disappears i ain‚Äôt mad,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,352,Winter,1902
haha kk,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,353,Winter,1902
i‚Äôm reticent to suggest it bc i think then he may go ‚Äúoh fuck now i definitely don‚Äôt want to disband that fleet‚Äù hahaha,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,354,Winter,1902
ill let you know how it goes,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,355,Winter,1902
no worries either way dude but i appreciate it,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,356,Winter,1902
he wasnt responded to me although i reached out,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,357,Winter,1902
not sure it will happen he doesnt seem to be online,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,358,Winter,1902
it would remove the farthest unit from his home then right if he doesn‚Äôt submit orders  which is either the fleet or the spain army i think,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,359,Winter,1902
sidebar germany is building an army in munich just a heads up,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,360,Winter,1902

whats going on with germany,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,370,Fall,1903
i really need you to hit constantinople and support me into smyrna so that army in armenia i think can‚Äôt bounce me  is that doable,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,371,Fall,1903
both are doable and done,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,372,Fall,1903
thats still not a guarantee youll get it but well try out best,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,373,Fall,1903
germany got russia to fuck up and it indirectly cost you a center,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,374,Fall,1903
so im not particularly happy rn,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,375,Fall,1903
what did germany do,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,376,Fall,1903
by threatening russia which wasnt the plan russia isnt in position to take back stp in the fall and thus we cant pressure that arm unit,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,377,Fall,1903
so arm is free to defend smy which means were not likely to get it,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,378,Fall,1903
yeah between that and france making a optimal disband decision that will make iberia take longer things are slowing down for us a bit  not the end of the world but i was hoping france and turkey would be well on their way to dead by now,1,True,-1,italy,austria,2,379,Fall,1903
turkey and england are notoriously hard to kill but germany is incredibly unhelpful,1,True,1,austria,italy,2,380,Fall,1903

this isnt a great look for us stay strong against france and turkey well have a stalemate line soon,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,421,Winter,1903
neither have ibut tbqh idk if that‚Äôs just bc it‚Äôs the weekendpeople perceive at this stage there‚Äôs not much to talk about,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,422,Spring,1904
unless there‚Äôs been some miraculous englandgermany rapprochement which i haven‚Äôt seen i think we‚Äôre good,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,423,Spring,1904
i mean germany and i have discussed next moves,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,424,Spring,1904
you still supporting me into smyrna per last turn,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,425,Spring,1904
so we need to shift some units or we cant get it,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,426,Spring,1904
but i can get you in fall 1903,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,427,Spring,1904
keep germany and england split,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,428,Spring,1904
it‚Äôs 1904 now,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,429,Spring,1904
i get that keeping england and france split is the overwhelming priority but i‚Äôd love to see movement on smyrna by the end of this year,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,430,Spring,1904
england and germany yeah,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,431,Spring,1904
and we cant get smy unless you move to syria here,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,432,Spring,1904
if i do that you move aeg to eas and greece to aeg in preparation for an attack next turn,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,433,Spring,1904
and yeah sorry slipped up there,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,434,Spring,1904
exactly,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,435,Spring,1904
ah shit  sorry man went to bed at 945 and forgot to change that order  super sorry,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,436,Spring,1904
yeah that sucked however the good news is that i got into sev so he may try a different defensive moveset this time i think we are a go for a supported attack of smyrna,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,437,Spring,1904
assume its us against turkey england and germany for the rest of the game,0,True,2,austria,italy,2,438,Fall,1904
we honestly got lucky that turn,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,439,Fall,1904
roger that  will push ahead with smyrna attack  apologies again  things are looking good,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,440,Fall,1904
its a bit of guessing here but fortunately we have turkey on lockdown for now  keep england and germany against each other  tell germany that you heard england plans to attack warsaw with my support or something,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,441,Fall,1904
actually tell him exactly that,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,442,Fall,1904
done,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,443,Fall,1904
great  hopefully there will be fireworks  if they go to war we win,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,444,Fall,1904
even if they give up the fight after a year,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,445,Fall,1904
supporting you into smyrna here confirm,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,446,Fall,1904
yes sorry just saw this shame it didn‚Äôt work,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,447,Winter,1904
good turn i thinkthoughts on builds  i was thinking army in venice time,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,448,Winter,1904
where do you plan for that unit to go you want to take on germany here,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,449,Winter,1904
also provided you continue to work with me here you get smyrna this season guaranteed the units turkey needs to support smyrna need to be disbanded here,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,450,Winter,1904
ayyyy i‚Äôm definitely working with you first things first,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,451,Winter,1904
youare my fire  our alliancemy one desire,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,452,Winter,1904
but yeah that was the plan  at least give myself some cover over there from any designs he might have  idk med feels full of ships and i can‚Äôt think of any other builds unless you can suggest one,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,453,Winter,1904
i would personally prefer to see an army build in rom which would go tuspiemar,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,454,Winter,1904
just bc an army in venice threatens you,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,455,Winter,1904
the problem is youre in a bit of a dilemma  you have a lot of ships true but not a ton of room for another army,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,456,Winter,1904
but its your call,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,457,Winter,1904
i‚Äôm gonna try to convoy the army in n africa to france i feel like an army in rome will just get stuck behind marseilles for a long while,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,458,Winter,1904
i think any army does which is the problem,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,459,Winter,1904
yeah i mean the problem is mao is clearly a choke point also,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,460,Winter,1904
unless i shoot an army straight up from venice at munich,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,461,Winter,1904
get france to support you in  the dude is desperate,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,462,Winter,1904
the tyr move will be a tough sell to me d,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,463,Winter,1904
especially if im helping you into smyrna,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,464,Winter,1904
üòò,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,465,Winter,1904
you don‚Äôt trust me at this point,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,466,Winter,1904
so i gotta go to bed soon just messaged france and no response so let‚Äôs assume we need to make this decision amongst ourselves,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,467,Winter,1904
i‚Äôm trying to make a build that brings maximum benefit to this alliance  i‚Äôm open to other suggestions if you can identify something that brings us more value,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,468,Winter,1904
talk to me here this has been going so well i don‚Äôt want things to fall apart now,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,469,Winter,1904
ok man bedtime for me hope i see a fleet from you in vienna  then we can start to move against germany etc,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,470,Winter,1904
shit shit im still here,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,471,Winter,1904
real life stuff took me away for a sec,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,472,Winter,1904
its not that i dont trust you right now im a diplomacy player and i prefer manufactured trust built up through our dmz it means i can work well with you without worrying about an imminent stab and vice versa which is easier for both of us,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,473,Winter,1904
i would prefer to keep that up so we can continue to work together without distraction,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,474,Winter,1904
you seem like a nice guy dril ,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,475,Winter,1904
heading to bed myself im sure itll work out,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,476,Winter,1904
sorry about that had a hard 9pm stop last night  happy to discuss moves today honestly considering moving venice over to piedmont to protect marseilles in which casesorry i even built it in venice in the first place  regardless we‚Äôll take it out,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,477,Spring,1905
talk it out,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,478,Spring,1905
i dont blame you i dont think the build was a great one but sometimes that happens,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,479,Spring,1905
the main point is that germany is terrifying and needs to be pulled apart  we cant slip into his centers but if you and england take him from the west while england and i take him on in russia we have a chance,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,480,Spring,1905
agreed re germany  wish we‚Äôd had more time to discuss that build but it happens,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,481,Spring,1905
what have your interactions with england been like  agreed germany is realllll real strong but he seems to be on good terms with england at least from germany‚Äôs optic,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,482,Spring,1905
im not concerned about the build lets definitely talk next moves tonight though,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,483,Spring,1905
our 1 focus is splitting germany and england  turkey is still too strong for us to start to pull off him,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,484,Spring,1905
ok agreed,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,485,Spring,1905
let‚Äôs talk whenever i‚Äôm gonna go to bed early but hopefully less early than last night,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,486,Spring,1905
hmu whenever and we‚Äôll talk strategy,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,487,Spring,1905
here rn off and on this is important and we need to be reaching out to england early too  lets figure this out now,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,488,Spring,1905
rgr,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,489,Spring,1905
what‚Äôre your thoughts,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,490,Spring,1905
on moves specifically,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,491,Spring,1905
id like to finish off turkey here without england fucking me,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,492,Spring,1905
if you can make sure that he doesnt support an attack on moscow you get smyrna,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,493,Spring,1905
wow wow wow,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,494,Spring,1905
i thought we were coordinating moves here,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,495,Spring,1905
we are,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,496,Spring,1905
and i thought i was getting smyrna regardless,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,497,Spring,1905
this is the first step,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,498,Spring,1905
not conditional on me making england do something i have no power to make him do,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,499,Spring,1905
i cant tap arm unless mos is safe see,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,500,Spring,1905
and then neither of us get anything,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,501,Spring,1905
i thought you were threatening me,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,502,Spring,1905
ahhh ok,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,503,Spring,1905
not explaining how to make this happen,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,504,Spring,1905
ofc not,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,505,Spring,1905
lol,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,506,Spring,1905
lol it seemed a little unsubtle for you,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,507,Spring,1905
i just messaged england,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,508,Spring,1905
what should i tell him,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,509,Spring,1905
he responded,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,510,Spring,1905
getting smyrna is a priority for me so i wanted to let you know the best way for us to do it,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,511,Spring,1905
do i have any moves to talk about with you,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,512,Spring,1905
yeah,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,513,Spring,1905
but well get there,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,514,Spring,1905
start with the easy stuff ,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,515,Spring,1905
like what i should tell england rn lol,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,516,Spring,1905
ask him to hit moscow and talk about how dangerous germany is,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,517,Spring,1905
like anything productive for that unit to be doing other than hitting me,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,518,Spring,1905
im working on him too,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,519,Spring,1905
ok,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,520,Spring,1905
im making progress,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,521,Spring,1905
lets talk about us now,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,522,Spring,1905
rgr,1,False,-2,italy,austria,2,523,Spring,1905
what us stuff would you like to discuss,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,524,Spring,1905
btw just sent this to england one of us has to move into it by the end of the year germany is building to move against me turkey is still a pain in the butt and italy is getting testy  i need your help to crack this dude and i cant be running damage control for the board on my own,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,525,Spring,1905
just roll with it if he asks,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,526,Spring,1905
lets talk about that venice unit,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,527,Spring,1905
absolutely  it‚Äôs not going into trieste obviously lol,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,528,Spring,1905
but i assume you wanted a deeper discussion haha,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,529,Spring,1905
yeah where is it going i hate to say it but tyr may be the right option,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,530,Spring,1905
mhmmm so i was thinking piedmont to bolster my army in marseilles against germany pressure,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,531,Spring,1905
i can always pull it back to venice if he moves to tyrolia,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,532,Spring,1905
lolll ok,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,533,Spring,1905
but tell me more about your thinking re tyroli,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,534,Spring,1905
id like to lock up that front and not have to worry about the north for the next two years,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,535,Spring,1905
assume he will,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,536,Spring,1905
youd get your smy center and once we turn away from turkey you can bet im coming hard for the north,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,537,Spring,1905
but id rather open a temporary front up there for now,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,538,Spring,1905
that marseilles army is mighty vulnerable tho,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,539,Spring,1905
of course holding marseilles isnt bad but you should have built a fleet for that,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,540,Spring,1905
thats true too,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,541,Spring,1905
once he gets into gascony,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,542,Spring,1905
army can do that and cover venice from german predations,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,543,Spring,1905
better build for me,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,544,Spring,1905
which is why its pivotal for us to get germany to hit england and vice versa,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,545,Spring,1905
and germany shouldnt need coaxing,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,546,Spring,1905
but he does for some reason  these players arent recognizing opportunities,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,547,Spring,1905
kinda like ya,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,548,Spring,1905
i mean they seem to be close allies lol,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,549,Spring,1905
us,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,550,Spring,1905
right,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,551,Spring,1905
what else do we gotta discuss,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,552,Spring,1905
ok then lol you can move to pie,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,553,Spring,1905
ill try to figure it out with england  this turn may suck  i may just pull back from turkey to cover up the north myself,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,554,Spring,1905
but we need to get g and e turned on each other,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,555,Spring,1905
this is the most pivotal turn of the game,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,556,Spring,1905
germany can get two more this turn and two more after that which would be thirteen and england would be powerless to stop him,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,557,Spring,1905
we wouldnt be in position to help england and germany would get up to 16 by the time we finish turkey and you get around the mao chokepoint,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,558,Spring,1905
yeahhhh,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,559,Spring,1905
germanyhas done nicely,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,560,Spring,1905
i‚Äôm confused why,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,561,Spring,1905
how rather,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,562,Spring,1905
but we‚Äôre good on moves,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,563,Spring,1905
nothing more to discuss,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,564,Spring,1905
were good  can you tell germany that he should move on edinburgh and norway here,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,565,Spring,1905
am communicating rn,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,566,Spring,1905
germany says you know his real name,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,567,Spring,1905
wtf,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,568,Spring,1905
yeah,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,569,Spring,1905
how,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,570,Spring,1905
he‚Äôs freaked,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,571,Spring,1905
yeah clearly,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,572,Spring,1905
i think its working though,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,573,Spring,1905
how did you get his irl name,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,574,Spring,1905
if the goal is to make him do your bidding idk if that‚Äôll work,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,575,Spring,1905
no the point is a little more subtle,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,576,Spring,1905
i can explain after the game,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,577,Spring,1905
mhmmm,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,578,Spring,1905
do you know my irl name,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,579,Spring,1905
would it help us win the game if i did,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,580,Spring,1905
sure,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,581,Spring,1905
dude that‚Äôs kinda creepy,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,582,Spring,1905
that you know that,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,583,Spring,1905
its not that creepy  if we do aars ill talk about it and my reason for name dropping,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,584,Spring,1905
ehhh talk about it now why not,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,585,Spring,1905
i won‚Äôt repeat anything you say,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,586,Spring,1905
i‚Äôm just concerned about the extent to which the veil of anonymity has been pieced,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,587,Spring,1905
ill keep it at that,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,588,Spring,1905
nearly 0,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,589,Spring,1905
mhmmm i need you to give me some more info man,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,590,Spring,1905
germany shares a lot about his personal life,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,591,Spring,1905
that should answer your questions,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,592,Spring,1905
i‚Äôm not sure this accomplished what you wanted,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,593,Spring,1905
i think it did  i dont think germany knows what i was going for  i pulled an old trick on him but it accomplished a couple points,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,594,Spring,1905
although,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,595,Spring,1905
it did freak him out far more than i intended,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,596,Spring,1905
ive had people look me up on facebook my gf my family,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,597,Spring,1905
he willfully volunteered his information so im a bit surprised hes surprised,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,598,Spring,1905
i think this is a case of you not appreciating that he‚Äôs probably more casual than you haha,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,599,Spring,1905
do you know my name,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,600,Spring,1905
no,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,601,Spring,1905
we good,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,602,Spring,1905
yep,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,603,Spring,1905
i‚Äôm gonna get smyrna before next builds won‚Äôt i,1,,-2,italy,austria,2,604,Spring,1905
thats the plan  its a guessing game with turkey as you can see,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,605,Spring,1905
youre going to get it this turn possibly at the cost of my losing sev,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,606,Spring,1905
that‚Äôll be ok tho,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,607,Spring,1905
bc we‚Äôll get it back üòÉ,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,608,Spring,1905
as a team,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,609,Spring,1905
ok bed now,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,610,Spring,1905

night,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,612,Spring,1905
welp,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,613,Spring,1905
the lines are drawn  if we hadnt gotten smyrna this round i would have had to stop supporting it,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,614,Spring,1905
also i really wish you had moved to tyr now whatever hindsight 2020,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,615,Spring,1905
well i could lose smyrna pretty easily next turn if you don‚Äôt either support me or blast constantinople,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,616,Spring,1905
so i‚Äôm not happy just yet,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,617,Spring,1905
it looks like you mismanaged germany tbqh,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,618,Spring,1905
hell if i were god and could do everything i would have one the game now  i talked to germany and england for 5 hours extended the game deadline by another hour and got germany to mismanage a critical convoy as well as not push gascony  ill take it,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,619,Spring,1905
you need to support me into con this turn  it likely wont work but it will in the spring next year,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,620,Spring,1905
can we confirm that you can support me to con,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,621,Fall,1905
done,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,622,Fall,1905

whadda turn i‚Äôm just checking back in,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,627,Fall,1905
i think we lose this honestly,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,628,Fall,1905
yeahhhh it‚Äôs not lookin good,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,629,Fall,1905
why didn‚Äôt you tell me you were going into tyrolia,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,630,Fall,1905
because i needed to block him and i know you werent doing it anymore,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,631,Fall,1905
mhmm thought we had a non aggression pact there tho,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,632,Fall,1905
like i‚Äôm not opposed but heads up would‚Äôve been nice,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,633,Fall,1905
but germany is aggressive to us both and im not letting him into tyr,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,634,Fall,1905
thats fair,1,True,2,austria,italy,2,635,Fall,1905
yeah communication is still important but you know that,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,636,Fall,1905
we gotta keep it together now lol,1,True,-2,italy,austria,2,637,Fall,1905
so germany is getting into tyrolia this turn huh,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,638,Spring,1906
definitely not but we need to guess perfectly here,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,639,Spring,1906
what‚Äôre you thinking,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,640,Spring,1906
i think the only think that we need for sure is you to move into tyr here,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,641,Spring,1906
ive spent the day coordinating the east with turkey,1,True,0,austria,italy,2,642,Spring,1906
it probably matters where i move from yes,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,643,Spring,1906
assuming you are supporting me  or is that incorrect on my part,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,644,Spring,1906
ideally move via venice so we maintain that front and you still have that one army to protect your army in marseilles,1,,0,austria,italy,2,645,Spring,1906
im trying to take back vienna but if that doesnt work will be just sitting in for the long haul around tyr,1,,0,austria,italy,2,646,Spring,1906
aside from that we need to get the med blocked up,1,,0,austria,italy,2,647,Spring,1906
i think we can hold everything if the med is safe,1,,0,austria,italy,2,648,Spring,1906
ideally you can burn that naf army and replace with a fleet,1,,0,austria,italy,2,649,Spring,1906
also you lose that mar army this turn ,1,,0,austria,italy,2,650,Fall,1906
solid,1,,0,austria,italy,2,651,Winter,1906
,1,,0,italy,austria,2,652,Spring,1907
what do you want smyrna and venice to do,1,True,0,italy,austria,2,653,Spring,1907
supporting ven to ukr here  your call on smyrna,1,,0,austria,italy,2,654,Spring,1907
supporting venice to tyr here,1,,0,austria,italy,2,655,Spring,1907
what‚Äôre you thinking for the early game,1,,-1,italy,russia,2,0,Spring,1901

thinks seem pretty cordial so far that said i wouldn‚Äôt mind a thorn in his side what are you thinking,1,,0,england,italy,2,2,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm thinking it might be to our advantage to pressure him a bitrn he‚Äôs getting a lot of builds this turn and then he‚Äôs probably coming straight at us,1,True,0,italy,england,2,3,Fall,1901
i can move on picardy but only if you move on belgium  i think germany is going for him so now‚Äôs your chance to get a slice of france while the getting is good,0,True,0,italy,england,2,4,Fall,1901
looking back at the board and damn he has left belgium wide open for you,1,True,0,italy,england,2,5,Fall,1901

i obviously have a vested interest in you putting full court press on francewhich requires further coordination with germanyjust keep me in the loop on how i can support,1,True,-1,italy,england,2,19,Fall,1902
the only thing preventing that is germany let‚Äôs work on him together,1,True,1,england,italy,2,20,Fall,1902

can you provide him assurances you‚Äôd give him a lion‚Äôs share of the france builds  i think it would go a long way to securing his cooperation,1,True,-1,italy,england,2,44,Fall,1902
are we allowed to group chat,1,True,1,england,italy,2,45,Fall,1902
we should work out the slicing together,1,True,1,england,italy,2,46,Fall,1902
i suggested you take marseille and spain i take brest and portugal and he gets paris and belgium,1,True,1,england,italy,2,47,Fall,1902

im not quite sure what a single fleet is going to do when austria is literally 2 spaces away from con,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,57,Winter,1901
the black sea strait does not allow me to use armies to their advantage fleets are better,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,58,Winter,1901

why no fleet in ankara then  that‚Äôs much less threatening to me,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,60,Winter,1901

ok i mean we don‚Äôt have much more to talk about then,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,65,Winter,1901
what really matters is what im going to do with the fleet theres no way for me to move f eas  ion unless you vacate that even so i need those fleets supporting my push into the balkans,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,66,Winter,1901

i don‚Äôt want that though  but i don‚Äôt see other options if you make that build,0,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,75,Winter,1901
what would you suggest,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,76,Winter,1901
build an army there not a fleet,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,77,Winter,1901
then we gucci,0,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,78,Winter,1901
im working out some scenarios so just give me a second,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,79,Winter,1901
rgr,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,80,Winter,1901
i‚Äôm around,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,81,Winter,1901
fair enough i do not see scenarios where you backstab and still have the upper hand against austria,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,82,Winter,1901
sorry for being so distrustful,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,83,Winter,1901
backstab who  i‚Äôm confused lol,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,84,Winter,1901
well im consdering you convoying a tun  smy for example,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,85,Winter,1901
but im glad that wont be an issue üòÉ,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,86,Winter,1901
why the fuckkkk would i do that lol,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,87,Winter,1901
you are too paranoid for someone fighting a two front ear lol,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,88,Winter,1901
war,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,89,Winter,1901
i‚Äôm confusedwhat‚Äôre you intentions re fleet vice army build,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,90,Winter,1901
ill build an army in smy,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,91,Winter,1901
rgr,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,92,Winter,1901
glad we could work this out,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,93,Winter,1901
if you can go to alb with your army in tunesia i can then try to support an attack on greece later,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,94,Winter,1901
hmmmm lemme look at the board real quick and think,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,95,Winter,1901
im not sure if you have other plans but i would like to think ahead a little bit to see what we can do,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,96,Winter,1901
maybe we should talk post builds i‚Äôm not saying no but i gotta see how france‚Äôs builds shake out,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,97,Winter,1901
happy to game things out rn tho,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,98,Winter,1901
specifically if you do f ion s a alb  gre it is unlikely austria will be able to stop that given that ill be pushing for rum and bul if necessary,1,,1,turkey,italy,2,99,Winter,1901
so whats the plan from here,1,,1,turkey,italy,2,100,Spring,1902
what is your plan with f eas,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,101,Fall,1902
honestly not sure  thinking of bringing it into the aegean and using it to support somebody  do you have ideas,0,False,-1,italy,turkey,2,102,Fall,1902
yeah i think moving to aegaen would be very helpful i could then help you get into greece afterwards as well if i can get bul,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,103,Fall,1902
still its looking like austria will get at least 1 build,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,104,Fall,1902
im not quite sure what to do i think i can survive a year or two but maybe not more,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,105,Fall,1902
yeah you‚Äôre in a tough spot  what motivated your decision to go after russia,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,106,Fall,1902
i was playing along with austria plus then i gambled hed f sev  bla so i could just move in with a arm  sev,1,,1,turkey,italy,2,107,Fall,1902
also he was not being communicative and was only moving north so i had assumed he was allied with austria  he confirmed it only now,1,,1,turkey,italy,2,108,Fall,1902
anyway id be cool to sit it out for a few turns with 45 cp but i think austria will continue pressuring me,1,,1,turkey,italy,2,109,Fall,1902
brb going to grab dinner,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,110,Fall,1902
so idk if it makes any difference re your build but honestly i‚Äôd be happy with smy and i‚Äôd leave you alone after that  just saying,1,False,0,italy,turkey,2,111,Winter,1902
im not sure what your intended outcome here is though sure smy is nice but the rest would belong to austria which means he has 9 command centers and you have 6 if you can hold mar,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,112,Winter,1902
10 actually,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,113,Winter,1902
im happy to cooperate but you need to show some goodwill first,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,114,Spring,1903
i‚Äôm a little confused here what can you offer me,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,115,Fall,1903
i‚Äôm a lil pissed at austria rn but i don‚Äôt see what you bring to the table,1,False,0,italy,turkey,2,116,Fall,1903
if nothing else a common enemy,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,117,Fall,1903
it would be fairly easy for us to destroy austrias fleet together for example,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,118,Fall,1903
ok i‚Äôm listening how,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,119,Fall,1903
i‚Äôm salty at ol austriahungry but idk if we can turn the tide,1,,0,italy,turkey,2,120,Fall,1903
i should‚Äôve stabbed him when i had the chance,1,False,0,italy,turkey,2,121,Fall,1903
i can support f eas  aeg with two ships if you move f tys  ion then it would be disbanded but its fall so he can rebuild youd need to wait untill spring,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,122,Fall,1903
or if you dont wish to go so far going f easion would free me up  a little to move my fleet out and then we can attack from both sides,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,123,Fall,1903
hmmm looking at nap now,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,124,Fall,1903
nah i don‚Äôt like that last idea,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,125,Fall,1903
he‚Äôll know i‚Äôm gunning for him and he can maybe take venice,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,126,Fall,1903
then in spring we can go for greece for example,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,127,Fall,1903
lemme evaluate idea 1,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,128,Fall,1903
seems reasonable to me to withdraw the fleet if you need it against france,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,129,Fall,1903
after all there isnt much hope of you getting smy,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,130,Fall,1903
man even in idea 1,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,131,Fall,1903
if that fleet gets disbanded bc of me he judtcrebuilds it next to venice,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,132,Fall,1903
and then i‚Äôm fucked,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,133,Fall,1903
right  am i missing something,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,134,Fall,1903
well yeah you just gotta play it cool for fall and then go for him in spring,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,135,Fall,1903
given that germany is moving east im not sure he can handle three fronts plus hes got 23 of his dudes knocking on my door already,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,136,Fall,1903
to no avail your door is locked pretty tight lol,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,137,Fall,1903
is germany moving against him,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,138,Fall,1903
i think hes going for russia but surely he must not want that theyve been allied too,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,139,Fall,1903
ugh,1,False,0,italy,turkey,2,140,Fall,1903
so i guess we‚Äôll revisit next turn,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,141,Fall,1903
when he‚Äôs a bit farther from builds and i can get a build so i have an army in venice,1,False,0,italy,turkey,2,142,Fall,1903
id try to your army in tunis moved to mainland so that your ships are freed up,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,143,Fall,1903
i mean he cant do anything with 1 army against your 1,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,144,Fall,1903
if he moves troops away from the balkans he loses his stuff there,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,145,Fall,1903
there‚Äôs just no way to get it there quickly yknow,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,146,Fall,1903
if i do that and he gets a build this turn he sees where i‚Äôm going,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,147,Fall,1903
and it‚Äôs game over,1,False,0,italy,turkey,2,148,Fall,1903
convoy from tunis then you can move from rom to ven,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,149,Fall,1903
even if he builds 1 in tri you can block the move to ven with 1 army while you move your ships,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,150,Fall,1903
yeah but then if he wants he can bring a fleet to fuck me and stillcgold thecline againdtcyou,1,False,0,italy,turkey,2,151,Fall,1903
it‚Äôs just not the right time this turn,1,False,0,italy,turkey,2,152,Fall,1903
not drunk just on my phone and typing quickly lol,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,153,Fall,1903
again what is 1 fleet gonna do at the very least you equal him in fleets and then theres me,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,154,Fall,1903
moreover if he builds a fleet he cannot protect vie from germany,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,155,Fall,1903
unless they have a deal somehow,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,156,Fall,1903
his one fleet plus one army in trieste against one army of mine in rome i lose venice,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,157,Fall,1903
it‚Äôs not just a matter of who has what it‚Äôs where that stuff is yknow,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,158,Fall,1903
wheres this second unit gonna come from he will only get 1 build,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,159,Fall,1903
he can take his fleet from greece real quick,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,160,Fall,1903
httpswwwbackstabbrcomsandbox5727111032078336 heres a worst case scenario where i dont do anything and he moves to albania in spring,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,161,Fall,1903
ok admittely a ser tri would be worse but thats still not enough to punch through,1,True,0,turkey,italy,2,162,Fall,1903
uhhh lemme think about it man,1,True,0,italy,turkey,2,163,Fall,1903

you gotta come to terms with england somehow,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,172,Fall,1909
why do i have to do that,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,173,Fall,1909

yeah i figured i just needed on ally and austria would lose took a  while,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,187,Fall,1910
and yeah he berated me for not helping him taking france out despite the fact that i said we had a turn left to do it,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,188,Fall,1910
which i get why everyone wants france gone but it‚Äôs not that much money lol,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,189,Fall,1910
also its the better move for you to go this turn so you dont have to protect spain  por,1,,1,turkey,italy,2,190,Fall,1910
i also noted your army in tun the whole game you shouldve tried to use it p,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,191,Fall,1910

if you recall,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,193,Fall,1910
i think the  fact that austria committed so hard on beating me but not being able to do it cost him the game,1,True,1,turkey,italy,2,194,Fall,1910

huge waste of resources,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,2,198,Fall,1910

thats the plan,1,,0,austria,germany,2,30,Spring,1901
dope,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,31,Spring,1901
hey austria i wanted to take your temperature for your plan this turn,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,32,Fall,1901
hey not sure yet if youre online in an hour lets talk then  what up with you and russia,1,,0,austria,germany,2,33,Fall,1901
hey just got back,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,34,Fall,1901
ok,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,35,Fall,1901
thoughts on russia,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,36,Fall,1901
idk i‚Äôm probably going to let him take sweden as long as we agree on him not attacking ber,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,37,Fall,1901
idk if i can trust that he would and i cannot afford to lose it obviously,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,38,Fall,1901
i wouldnt give him sweden if i were you,1,,0,austria,germany,2,39,Fall,1901
why,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,40,Fall,1901
regardless of if he keeps his word with ber and he has no real reason to he has three units up north and there is nowhere productive for them to go either than retreat or back into you  the more builds he has that he can commit up north the more he can just overwhelm you,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,41,Fall,1901
well he could go south he could focus on turkey,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,42,Fall,1901
he can in theory but look where his units are  it will take three moves before any of them are in play  three moves  that will be the start of 1903,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,43,Fall,1901
you talking with italy,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,44,Fall,1901
a little,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,45,Fall,1901
what did he ask for,1,,0,austria,germany,2,46,Fall,1901
what are chats like with england and france,1,,0,austria,germany,2,47,Fall,1901
ive heard very little,1,,0,austria,germany,2,48,Fall,1901
a truce for the first few turns,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,49,Fall,1901
do you have a deal with russia i don‚Äôt understand why he didn‚Äôt wargal,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,50,Fall,1901
sorry people will know who i am when they see my prof pic,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,51,Fall,1901
probably smart,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,52,Fall,1901
i wonder if i know any of you guys irl,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,53,Fall,1901
could you move on france here,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,54,Fall,1901
not at the moment not with russia breathing down my neck do you have a deal with russia  its hard to imagine he chose not to wargal without working something out with you,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,55,Fall,1901
my deal with russia is that hes an idiot  im moving on him here  just block him is sweden and make my job easier  im trying to cripple him to help you out a bit,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,56,Fall,1901
he cant even convoy from lvn he just doeant know what hes doing,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,57,Fall,1901
i think so too but i can‚Äôt risk him taking ber so i‚Äôm going mun  ber i‚Äôm happy to help out and bounce russia in sweden,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,58,Fall,1901
thanks,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,59,Fall,1901
he said hes moving back to war here this turn btw so dont overcommit too hard,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,60,Fall,1901
thanks for the tip better safe than sorry,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,61,Fall,1901
losing ber this early would be too damaging to risk,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,62,Fall,1901
mun  ruh would give me opportunity to be a bigger player in the west,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,63,Fall,1901
my best guess with russia is that he moves pru ber lynwar,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,64,Fall,1901
what are you thinking with italy and turkey,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,65,Fall,1901
agree with you on all counts,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,66,Fall,1901
italy is communicative and i like him turkey is uncommunicative,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,67,Fall,1901
do you and italy have something worked out as well,1,,0,germany,austria,2,68,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm with you on italy you two are the countries i have the best relationship with at this point,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,69,Fall,1901
so berlin huh,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,70,Winter,1901
kind of a petty thing not to tell the truth about,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,71,Winter,1901
me,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,72,Winter,1901
i changed my mind at the last second based on what you told me,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,73,Winter,1901
sorry if that upsets your plans,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,74,Winter,1901
no i just wished that we were upfront  this is a small thing but i want to be able to trust you throughout the game,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,75,Winter,1901
hey man i totally understand and that‚Äôs my bad,1,,0,germany,austria,2,76,Winter,1901
largely because you told me he was going to warsaw and he said the same thing literally i mean literally in the last minute i changed my move,1,,0,germany,austria,2,77,Winter,1901
like i really don‚Äôt want any issues here,1,,0,germany,austria,2,78,Winter,1901
and i don‚Äôt think the move to ruh hurts you unless you‚Äôre going after me next turn i‚Äôm a little worried because you have two builds near me,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,79,Winter,1901
definitely a gamble on my end with ruh tho but since you and russia told me the same thing i took a chance with it,1,,0,germany,austria,2,80,Winter,1901
tbh i didn‚Äôt even think about what i told you because it wasn‚Äôt like we were planing something together with regard to that move,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,81,Winter,1901
it isnt going at you  austria and germany rarely attack each other,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,82,Winter,1901
right that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm hoping too,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,83,Winter,1901
im not mad at you just concerned for the future  can we commit to sharing those updates  i change little moves or messages based on whats going on and i want to have info as accurate as possible,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,84,Winter,1901
so were cool,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,85,Winter,1901
absolutely it was a last minute gut call based on your intel i will be sure to keep you abreast of any changes i make going forward i really appreciate you saying something because when i made that move the intel i told you didn‚Äôt cross my mind at all when it should have,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,86,Winter,1901
the west is concerning although you should get bel next turn,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,87,Winter,1901
thanks again for understanding,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,88,Winter,1901
yes but i have to work something out with france first,1,,0,germany,austria,2,89,Winter,1901
sure thing  what are we doing going forward f and e are quite strong,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,90,Winter,1901
i think my best path is the ally with france and break england,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,91,Winter,1901
agreed,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,92,Winter,1901
e should not have gotten bel here,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,93,Winter,1901
not for free,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,94,Winter,1901
yes it‚Äôs true committed to bounce bur with france slowed me down in doing anything about it but it was worth it to show france i can be a trustworthy partner,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,95,Winter,1901
can you get france moving up towards england e needs to go,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,96,Winter,1901
that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm working on have you talked to france much seems a bit curt,1,,0,germany,austria,2,97,Winter,1901
a bit  i think i know him,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,98,Winter,1901
yeah chances are we all probably know someone else here,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,99,Winter,1901
the convoy was flashy but marooned an army  well see,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,100,Winter,1901
get him to build up towards eng please,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,101,Winter,1901
sure thing chief thanks again for understanding my experience with this game is almost all gunboat so i am still getting used to some of the dynamics of alliances,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,102,Winter,1901
sure thing  im working magic around the board  russia is moving south against t and france should be going with you,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,103,Winter,1901
excellent news,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,104,Winter,1901
go easy on russia for a bit  i need him against turkey,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,105,Winter,1901
will do,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,106,Winter,1901
i‚Äôm building an army in mun and a fleet in kiev,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,107,Winter,1901
just a heads up,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,108,Winter,1901
sounds like a plan,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,109,Winter,1901
thanks,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,110,Winter,1901
f tri a vie,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,111,Winter,1901
104,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,112,Winter,1901
you know what italy is planning to do here,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,113,Spring,1902
i think he wants to go after france,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,114,Spring,1902
idk anything specific,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,115,Spring,1902
i think england and france might be working together here,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,116,Spring,1902
considering the bounced the channel,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,117,Spring,1902
kk thanks  just curious,1,,0,austria,germany,2,118,Spring,1902
hmmm,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,119,Spring,1902
not sure i like that,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,120,Spring,1902
you may need italy to help keep france in check not sure,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,121,Spring,1902
have you asked him,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,122,Spring,1902
here‚Äôs my moves as of now they are still subject to change i just want you to know my tentative plans,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,123,Spring,1902
khel denmark supporting russia into sweden ruhr into belgium with hol support mun  bur,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,124,Spring,1902
looks good  what are you asking from russia in return for the sweden support,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,125,Spring,1902
basically he won‚Äôt attack me and focus on turkey,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,126,Spring,1902
also the only real alternative is leaving sweden open for england,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,127,Spring,1902
you could strongarm him into making him give it to you,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,128,Spring,1902
you arent going to do well if youre being attacked from the north and the south so give me sweden and ill lay off you for the game,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,129,Spring,1902
hmmm good idea,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,130,Spring,1902
make russia give me sweden,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,131,Spring,1902
russia didn‚Äôt get back to me my orders are still set to support him,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,132,Spring,1902
just an fyi,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,133,Spring,1902
k,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,134,Spring,1902
i don‚Äôt mind helping if it keeps england away,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,135,Spring,1902
i can still switch to bouncing russia,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,136,Spring,1902
i prefer russia not be too strong in the south which is undoubtably where he will use that build,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,137,Spring,1902
how do i benefit from knocking him out early tho i‚Äôm happy with nonaggression on my eastern front,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,138,Spring,1902
he can keep turkey busy,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,139,Spring,1902
he was a good dude to me by not taking ber,1,,0,germany,austria,2,140,Spring,1902
dont know him out  i still need him  just not overly strong,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,141,Spring,1902
i recommend bouncing him and taking sweden for yourself  when he goes down and he will hell burn his units up north since hes being invaded from the south,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,142,Spring,1902
youd much rather have your own unit up there,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,143,Spring,1902
not being burned,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,144,Spring,1902
fair do you think i can take and hold belgium,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,145,Spring,1902
i could also do k  bal and lock in sweden in the fall,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,146,Spring,1902
then pivot to taking the north sea next year,1,,0,germany,austria,2,147,Spring,1902
project power,1,,0,austria,germany,2,148,Spring,1902
strength is king here,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,149,Spring,1902
bal is a little misdirected i recommend belgium,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,150,Spring,1902
so what should i do with the fleet in kiev,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,151,Spring,1902
what are the chances that england goes to stp here,1,,0,austria,germany,2,152,Spring,1902
idk we‚Äôre not really talking,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,153,Spring,1902
that would be more problematic than anything,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,154,Spring,1902
maybe hope that england and russia bounce swe and go f denska f kieden,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,155,Spring,1902
yeah that could be sharp gives me ground to take scandinavia or the north sea,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,156,Spring,1902
mhm,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,157,Spring,1902
are you helping italy into mar here,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,158,Fall,1902
i can,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,159,Fall,1902
but we haven‚Äôt discussed,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,160,Fall,1902
i guess i‚Äôm basically dead to england and france with that last turn so,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,161,Fall,1902
youre not  i have you back in chat and italy is coming,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,162,Fall,1902
help him and well help you,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,163,Fall,1902
done,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,164,Fall,1902
yeah i think i have to throw england to the wind,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,165,Fall,1902
hey man what are you thinking,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,166,Fall,1902
it looks like france russia and turkey are all gonna have problems,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,167,Fall,1902
im working my way north and working some magic on france and england,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,168,Fall,1902
let me know how i can ever assist you diplomatically,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,169,Fall,1902
so,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,170,Fall,1902
i basically have to choose,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,171,Fall,1902
like right now,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,172,Fall,1902
to come to terms with england or to make a deal with france,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,173,Fall,1902
france is dead,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,174,Fall,1902
i wont make your decision for you but use that information as you will,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,175,Fall,1902
obviously you‚Äôre more experienced at this than i am but an anglogermanic alliance is tough to pull off,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,176,Fall,1902
im saying france is dead and recommend going after england,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,177,Fall,1902
if italy takes most of f there wont be any left for you,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,178,Fall,1902
and you have the positional jump on england right now given your moveset,1,,0,austria,germany,2,179,Fall,1902
ah,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,180,Fall,1902
i see,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,181,Fall,1902
your call but i really want to see you succeed here,0,True,0,austria,germany,2,182,Fall,1902
what moves do you recommend,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,183,Fall,1902
take the north sea support yourself in belgium and let italy into mar,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,184,Fall,1902
you get a build here for that additional fleet next year,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,185,Fall,1902
if i take the north sea and france take the channel england is in big big trouble,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,186,Fall,1902
move ska to north sea,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,187,Fall,1902
no denmark,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,188,Fall,1902
why,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,189,Fall,1902
youll need to keep ska because it borders nwyswenth,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,190,Fall,1902
those are all key,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,191,Fall,1902
plus if you build a fleet in the winter you want it in denmark next year,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,192,Fall,1902
so denmark needs to be open,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,193,Fall,1902
russia will hold in sweden he needs to in order to get that build,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,194,Fall,1902
should i tell him ‚Äúit‚Äôs been good trying to work this out but i don‚Äôt think i can agree to these terms sorry and best of luck‚Äù,1,,0,germany,austria,2,195,Fall,1902
it sucks i would have loved to work something out with england but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs workable for more than a year or two ,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,196,Fall,1902
you need to grow and you and england are directly opposed and vying for the same territory,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,197,Fall,1902
dont feel bad this is part of the game,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,198,Fall,1902
you can do this,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,199,Fall,1902
so just knife him or tell him hey i don‚Äôt don‚Äôt we have a deal here i‚Äôm sorry,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,200,Fall,1902
dont talk if its not productive,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,201,Fall,1902
if he gets back to you with a good deal go for it,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,202,Fall,1902
but dont lose your advantage here,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,203,Fall,1902
what would that look like,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,204,Fall,1902
hes messaging me now,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,205,Fall,1902
like a good deal with england,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,206,Fall,1902
you get all of scandinavia,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,207,Fall,1902
thats a start,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,208,Fall,1902
and he moves on france,1,,0,austria,germany,2,209,Fall,1902
but long term he wants to move through russia,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,210,Fall,1902
i suppose he still can through the north sea,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,211,Fall,1902
right,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,212,Fall,1902
sorry that was incorrect,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,213,Fall,1902
norwegian,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,214,Fall,1902
yes but he needs norway to do that,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,215,Fall,1902
norwegian sea to barents sea,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,216,Fall,1902
double convoy not that hard,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,217,Fall,1902
also he doesnt know this but hes not getting any of russia,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,218,Fall,1902
so that fish is dead in the watee,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,219,Fall,1902
you‚Äôre gonna take the whole thing,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,220,Fall,1902
also also if he goes for russia hell basically have surrounded you im not sure why youd want that,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,221,Fall,1902
turkey may take a lot,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,222,Fall,1902
hes closer than i,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,223,Fall,1902
so keep my orders set to take the north sea and invade from holland next turn,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,224,Fall,1902
i suggest it,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,225,Fall,1902
youll have three fleets next year too,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,226,Fall,1902
so youll be fine,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,227,Fall,1902
i have to run,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,228,Fall,1902
you should join the diplomacy nexus server though,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,229,Fall,1902

can you let turkey know that you just heard from me that im supporting italy to smyrna,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,239,Spring,1903
keep it discrete as if the information was leaked and youre trying to share it to help him,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,240,Spring,1903

what are you thinking this turn,1,,1,germany,austria,2,247,Fall,1903

thanks man i would prefer to not get into the details of it if that‚Äôs cool it was a semiprivate event,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,271,Spring,1904
sure no worries,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,272,Spring,1904
i just finished lunch break but we can talk this evening,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,273,Spring,1904

that i dont hate you and vice versa ,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,278,Spring,1904
that would be a good start,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,279,Spring,1904
would love to talk about a takedown of england here though,1,,0,austria,germany,2,280,Spring,1904
yeah for sure,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,281,Spring,1904
happy to listen üòÉ,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,282,Spring,1904
can you get your units in position for takes of norway and stp thats two scs for you and i can help you with warsaw in the fall goes well and we adhere to our agreements,0,False,0,austria,germany,2,283,Spring,1904
idk i‚Äôm not looking to expand past warsaw and paris this turn not trying to pick an unnecessary fight forcing me to defend more territory than i have units to do so successfully,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,284,Spring,1904
im not sure youre getting paris from how england was talking,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,285,Spring,1904
what did he say,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,286,Spring,1904
i asked him what he thought about you and he said he was nervous you were getting too big and you may need to be slowed down,0,True,0,austria,germany,2,287,Spring,1904
norway isnt much of a stretch and youll be weakening england here your only real enemy,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,288,Spring,1904
if i hit england than i have to defend my entire northern theatre i can take two more scs this turn without kicking over any logs,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,289,Spring,1904
except for me and england  youre going to get too big for comfort and the continuation of your working with england is a threat to me,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,290,Spring,1904
youre already making the both of us nervous and you wouldnt want to push it,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,291,Spring,1904
i prefer to stay neutral between the two of you and italy for that matter,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,292,Spring,1904
right but its about how people percieve you  you can take all the neutral centers you want but the larger you are the bigger the threat you are england and italy and i feel the pressure already  i dont have a problem with you yet but you need to turn on england here as the chance of you two working together will require both italy and i to stop what were doing and respond to the threat you two pose,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,293,Spring,1904
im trying to share this in your best interest,0,True,0,austria,germany,2,294,Spring,1904
if i‚Äôm not mistaken we have the same number of units,1,,0,germany,austria,2,295,Spring,1904
i don‚Äôt tell you to lay off turkey,1,,0,germany,austria,2,296,Spring,1904
or to go after italy,1,,0,germany,austria,2,297,Spring,1904
youre in a better position right now,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,298,Spring,1904
and you have free available centers two center jump,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,299,Spring,1904
and no true enemies for this one turn,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,300,Spring,1904
all those add up to make you far more dangerous  its not just about sc counts,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,301,Spring,1904
that‚Äôs true i‚Äôm trying to keep it that way no enemies,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,302,Spring,1904
i really do appreciate you being honest with me,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,303,Spring,1904
right but youll go from 0 to 3 if you misplay this one  this is critical i really want to see you succeed here and our central triple to remain intact ive put a lot of work into this one,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,304,Spring,1904
i suggest managing your front so you have just one enemy in front of you rather than 3 on all sides,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,305,Spring,1904
 im glad,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,306,Spring,1904
is there a way you can be comfortable a move set that doesn‚Äôt involve turning in england he got spoked that i accidentally went into ska,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,307,Spring,1904
he needs to be spooked  where do you think that army in lvp is going this turn,1,,0,austria,germany,2,308,Spring,1904
in edinburgh,1,,0,austria,germany,2,309,Spring,1904
its not going south,1,,0,austria,germany,2,310,Spring,1904
right it‚Äôs going norway,1,,0,germany,austria,2,311,Spring,1904
its convoying across to norway and after that either through scandinavia or into russia warsaw will be the first sc he takes back,1,,0,austria,germany,2,312,Spring,1904
that army is a recognition of the threat you pose please please please realize that,1,,0,austria,germany,2,313,Spring,1904
while youre being nice to him hes planning his attack,0,,0,austria,germany,2,314,Spring,1904
you think he‚Äôll turn on me,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,315,Spring,1904
that army can go nowhere but against your border,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,316,Spring,1904
it would be one thing if he was moving on a defenseless france,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,317,Spring,1904
but its not hes headed north,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,318,Spring,1904
thats your domain you need to start defending and thinking long term,1,,0,austria,germany,2,319,Spring,1904
i‚Äôm going to remain neutral this turn but i will revisit in the fall based on how my neighbors move,1,,0,germany,austria,2,320,Spring,1904
jesus  im already moving against england this turn  this is so frustrating to me im trying to help you out and youre going to start hurting the both of us,1,,0,austria,germany,2,321,Spring,1904
look at the board and see the moves being set up,1,,0,austria,germany,2,322,Spring,1904
he will have his front against you far before youll be able to react to it,1,,0,austria,germany,2,323,Spring,1904
i hope that does not imply and bad blood between us i just have to be up early tomorrow if he moves against me or does something looking suspicious i‚Äôll revisit it tomorrow,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,324,Spring,1904
well im clearly wrong about england but i still think its the wrong moveset,1,False,0,austria,germany,2,325,Spring,1904
you still there,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,326,Fall,1904
yes hey,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,327,Fall,1904
should we make the 10 pm chat a regular thing üòÇ,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,328,Fall,1904
hahahah,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,329,Fall,1904
little late for me ready for bed,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,330,Fall,1904
im in bed the last chat killed me last night lol,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,331,Fall,1904
but i felt too strongly to let it go rip,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,332,Fall,1904
lol no worries what‚Äôs going on tn i don‚Äôt have any interesting moves set just defense,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,333,Fall,1904
i hate to sound like a broken record but you can take norway here with literally no repercussions,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,334,Fall,1904
btw rumour has it that you‚Äôre a nationally ranked player is that so,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,335,Fall,1904
do you know what england is doing with moscow,1,,0,austria,germany,2,336,Fall,1904
but thats your call,1,,0,austria,germany,2,337,Fall,1904
not interested sorry,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,338,Fall,1904
not for certain no,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,339,Fall,1904
dont trust water cooler talk ,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,340,Fall,1904
is that a no,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,341,Fall,1904
ive played a lot of diplomacy and run a top diplomacy site  im sure there are better players than me out there,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,342,Fall,1904
makes sense,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,343,Fall,1904
in a perfect world you would talk moscow at no cost to yourself just to cut a potential support,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,344,Fall,1904
can you find out whats going on with moscow i would really not like him to hit sev,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,345,Fall,1904
i can ask i sent eng a couple messages in the last hour and haven‚Äôt heard back ,1,True,0,germany,austria,2,346,Fall,1904
i have too  would you be open to tapping moscow for me if you dont hear back,1,True,0,austria,germany,2,347,Fall,1904
because im not hearing back from england i may take moscow here so i dont lose a center to turkey  hopefully this gives you the ammunition you need to go after england yourself,1,,0,austria,germany,2,348,Fall,1904
thoughts for this turn,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,349,Spring,1905
i think you can win or lose on this one right here,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,350,Spring,1905
how‚Äôs that,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,351,Spring,1905
not sure how long were playing or if youre looking at stalemate lines but youre pretty damn close to the ns stalemate line and the board lead,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,352,Spring,1905
too close for comfort ‚ù§,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,353,Spring,1905
üòâ,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,354,Spring,1905
so what are you saying,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,355,Spring,1905
im not telling you how to win üòÇ,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,356,Spring,1905
i don‚Äôt see how i am going to win i‚Äôm in the center of the board you are almost as strong as me and will be stronger once you destroy turkey,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,357,Spring,1905
turkey isnt going down any time soon even slower if the two of us cant work something out tonight and i have to move back up nothing,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,358,Spring,1905
also youve discovered the golden diplomacy trick just insist youre not strong and hope others believe you,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,359,Spring,1905
what would it look like for us to work something out,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,360,Spring,1905
back up north,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,361,Spring,1905
it depends  your builds arent particularly friendly towards me or england and i think hes finally spooked,1,False,-1,austria,germany,2,362,Spring,1905
i don‚Äôt blame him,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,363,Spring,1905
so we can start with that  what is your intention with the two army builds,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,364,Spring,1905
i‚Äôll be honest it‚Äôs not madly thought through,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,365,Spring,1905
i can‚Äôt go north,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,366,Spring,1905
i can‚Äôt go anywhere,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,367,Spring,1905
all i can do is scare the pants off everyone,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,368,Spring,1905
you managed üòÇ,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,369,Spring,1905
ive been in conversations all day,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,370,Spring,1905
anything interesting,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,371,Spring,1905
mostly england asking me to pull off turkey and move north against you,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,372,Spring,1905
that was the most substantive,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,373,Spring,1905
is that true i‚Äôm not sure if i believe that are you baiting me into attacking england,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,374,Spring,1905
i cant share screenshots apparently but thats true  its not just england,0,,-1,austria,germany,2,375,Spring,1905
you and i are the big players here and italy asked me to do the same,0,,-1,austria,germany,2,376,Spring,1905
so why dont we as the big players take control of ourselves,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,377,Spring,1905
and run the board the way we want without the undue influence of the other players,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,378,Spring,1905
i mean i could be interested but i need some clarity,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,379,Spring,1905
i‚Äôm weary frankly i understand you are a very gifted player and i‚Äôm nervous about my odds of winning a one on one versus you,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,380,Spring,1905
ive been talking a lot and have a vision of the board that you dont seem to buy into  why dont you start with sharing your perfect setup  obviously its a win but where do you pick up your centers  we dont have to be at odds here  if i win its because i take out germany and italy  what is your ideal scenario,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,381,Spring,1905
im gifted because i spend time on conversations like this  most players dont  the moveset of diplomacy is pretty simple  akin to checkers  im terrible at the cold war 1v1 varient üòÑ d,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,382,Spring,1905
hmmm,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,383,Spring,1905
you‚Äôre also a verrrrrry smooth talker,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,384,Spring,1905
for all i know you‚Äôve already set up a massive plan to attack me,0,True,1,germany,austria,2,385,Spring,1905
hey man i‚Äôm gonna be away from my phone for 30 min,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,386,Spring,1905
you far overestimate me redacted lol,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,387,Spring,1905
who is this,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,388,Spring,1905
hmmm ok  moves process in less than two hours,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,389,Spring,1905
wait a second,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,390,Spring,1905
woah,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,391,Spring,1905
you just dropped a big thing there,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,392,Spring,1905
the point is you can trust me,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,393,Spring,1905
no i cant i have no idea who you are lol,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,394,Spring,1905
and you know who i am,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,395,Spring,1905
that‚Äôs like literally the opposite of trust lol,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,396,Spring,1905
faith then,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,397,Spring,1905
idk anyone who lives in maine or works at hudson,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,398,Spring,1905
this is legit creepy not gonna lie,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,399,Spring,1905
worked at hudson whatever,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,400,Spring,1905
this is having the opposite effect,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,401,Spring,1905
i didnt work there i was an intern,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,402,Spring,1905
the point is that we need to work something out asap,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,403,Spring,1905
yes definitely,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,404,Spring,1905
i mean if i knew who you were then i would feel much more comfortable and far more likely to work something out,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,405,Spring,1905
you talked it italy,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,406,Spring,1905
you talked to italy lol,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,407,Spring,1905
yeah dude i‚Äôm so freaked out rn,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,408,Spring,1905
thats what italy just said lol,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,409,Spring,1905
idk who else to talk to this is like actually freaking me out,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,410,Spring,1905
like irl,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,411,Spring,1905
like i‚Äôm really freaked,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,412,Spring,1905
dear god,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,413,Spring,1905
this is kinda distracting  youll find out who i am after the game,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,414,Spring,1905
dude but you know who i am rn,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,415,Spring,1905
like wtf,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,416,Spring,1905
how long have you played diplomacy,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,417,Spring,1905
definitely not used to being like doxed online lol,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,418,Spring,1905
i mean like i‚Äôve mostly played gunboat so i‚Äôm not used to the this dynamic,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,419,Spring,1905
i hope you are like a buddy of mine irl so we can laugh about this in a week but rn i‚Äôm just like wtf,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,420,Spring,1905
youre not being doxed you dont have to worry,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,421,Spring,1905
it‚Äôs like okay dude but it doesn‚Äôt feel chill to me that you have a face to a country and i don‚Äôt,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,422,Spring,1905
do you actually know me irl or did you just like figure out who i was through tracing an email address or something,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,423,Spring,1905
this is kind of a waste of our time  we can laugh this off when the game is over,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,424,Spring,1905
goddammit,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,425,Spring,1905
idk man it‚Äôs just like,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,426,Spring,1905
kinda erie from my pov,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,427,Spring,1905
who knows i might not like you irl,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,428,Spring,1905
lmfao,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,429,Spring,1905
or you could be a close buddy idk,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,430,Spring,1905
but either way,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,431,Spring,1905
i hate the dynamic of you knowing who i am irl and me being in the dark,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,432,Spring,1905
youll know my real name and all kinds of shit about me later lets play the game right now,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,433,Spring,1905
yeah dude i‚Äôm sorry but that gambit really backfired,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,434,Spring,1905
i want to work with you here lets start with that as a building block,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,435,Spring,1905
not it didnt,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,436,Spring,1905
it fundamentally creates an uneven and uneasy dynamic between me and you,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,437,Spring,1905
i do not feel comfy with it,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,438,Spring,1905
i know,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,439,Spring,1905
this has happened to me before,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,440,Spring,1905
sorry i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a great dude but i don‚Äôt like this it definitely did not create trust just totally broke it,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,441,Spring,1905
how long have you known how did you know who are you irl,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,442,Spring,1905
now these thoughts will supersede any thing you say,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,443,Spring,1905
sorry,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,444,Spring,1905
we didnt have trust before  you thought we had trust  this is foundational to the mirage of diplomacy,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,445,Spring,1905
and now you understand,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,446,Spring,1905
when you call me a good player or a smooth talker you know nothing about me or my gameplay style,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,447,Spring,1905
so now that weve broken the pieces we start from the beginning,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,448,Spring,1905
i have to run now  this was a very frustrating end to a good day,1,False,-1,austria,germany,2,449,Spring,1905
sorry man but you brought this on yourself,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,450,Spring,1905
im a little surprised youre surprised  you put your name publicly on discord and shared what you do for work and where you are on any given weekend,1,False,-1,austria,germany,2,451,Spring,1905
i could have found out your name in three different ways,1,False,-1,austria,germany,2,452,Spring,1905
hopefully we‚Äôll laugh about this in the future,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,453,Spring,1905
not nearly as creepy as the guy that looked me up on facebook and knows my girlfriends name,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,454,Spring,1905
ok,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,455,Spring,1905
someone in this current game,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,456,Spring,1905
no,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,457,Spring,1905
nobody has the capacity nor cares enough to dox you man,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,458,Spring,1905
sorry bro you made a calculation and you were wrong,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,459,Spring,1905
i dont believe i am now,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,460,Spring,1905
maybe this was all part of your plan idk idc,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,461,Spring,1905
you‚Äôre really smart and whatever idc,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,462,Spring,1905
i needed to flip your mindset a little bit,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,463,Spring,1905
but i didnt plan for you to be this freaked out,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,464,Spring,1905
so i do apologize for that,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,465,Spring,1905
it‚Äôs cool you must not know me that well irl,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,466,Spring,1905
diplomacy is all about trust  the beauty about it is that you cant trust anyone  all anyone can do is spin a web and make assumptions about people  you were trying to do that to me earlier it seems without realizing it,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,467,Spring,1905
did you request it,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,468,Spring,1905
nope just as surprised as you are,1,True,1,germany,austria,2,469,Spring,1905
wonder if england did,1,True,-1,austria,germany,2,470,Spring,1905
possibly,1,False,1,germany,austria,2,471,Spring,1905
are you moving south here,1,False,-1,austria,germany,2,472,Spring,1905
any final thoughts,1,,-1,austria,germany,2,473,Spring,1905
got to finalize some plans myself just checking in,0,,-1,austria,germany,2,474,Spring,1905
i can support you into rum here if you want  im holding my northern line so dont bother taking it out  however it may benefit you to move against t here,0,False,-4,austria,germany,2,475,Fall,1908
you there,1,True,-4,austria,germany,2,476,Fall,1908
yeah,1,True,4,germany,austria,2,477,Fall,1908
thoughts,1,True,-4,austria,germany,2,478,Fall,1908
i‚Äôm not interested man sorry üò¶,1,True,4,germany,austria,2,479,Fall,1908
hey russia  how‚Äôs it going excited for this game,1,True,-1,germany,russia,2,0,Spring,1901
hey germany should be a great game been a while since i‚Äôve played diplo are you going north to england,1,True,1,russia,germany,2,1,Spring,1901
me too tbh,1,,-1,germany,russia,2,2,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm keeping my options open at this point,1,,-1,germany,russia,2,3,Spring,1901
hbu,1,,-1,germany,russia,2,4,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm hoping to get along well with you and england and focus on france i think the three of us need to get in front of things and envision what scandinavia looks like in two years,1,False,-1,germany,russia,2,5,Spring,1901
i honestly don‚Äôt know what the heck france is doing to not even take spain with their first turn one that seems like a pretty obvious move i would like sweden for another supply center you can take norway i may need to protect my southern flank more from turkey who could cause problems,0,True,1,russia,germany,2,6,Fall,1901
are you going into ber in the fall,1,,-1,germany,russia,2,7,Fall,1901
no i‚Äôm holding in prussia to protect my east flank,1,False,1,russia,germany,2,8,Fall,1901
i don‚Äôt want to fight you and would much rather have peace so i can focus on expanding west but based on the location of your armies i don‚Äôt think i can let you take an additional supply center without concrete assurances,1,,-1,germany,russia,2,9,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm moving from prussia back to warsaw i expanded east too fast and i need to deal with turkey in the south i understand if you want to bounce me from sweden this turn but if you don‚Äôt i can more easily deal with my problems in the south and direct my attention away from you to the balkans,1,False,1,russia,germany,2,10,Fall,1901
what will you do with the lvn army,1,,-1,germany,russia,2,11,Fall,1901
we still have an hour i can be open to letting you take sweden,1,,-1,germany,russia,2,12,Fall,1901
shit i‚Äôm pretty screwed now disbanding my prussia army so you don‚Äôt need to worry about me need to beat turkey back to stay alive,1,True,-2,russia,germany,2,13,Winter,1901
i‚Äôm sorry man i should have trusted you but i was spooked by the two army‚Äôs near me i hope you understand,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,14,Winter,1901
yea i understand don‚Äôt blame you blame myself for moving east too fast really,1,True,-2,russia,germany,2,15,Winter,1901
turkey asked me why your army in ber halted what do you want me to say,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,16,Winter,1901
think you have to worry more about england right now i‚Äôm going to be locked down in the south trying to deal with turkey england can eventually take sweden unless you support me moving there then you can block england from getting it and it gives me some life in my fight down south with a new supply center otherwise i‚Äôm not gonna last very long most likely and you‚Äôll be dealing with england by yourself,1,True,-2,russia,germany,2,17,Spring,1902
yes happy to let you move into sweden what should i say to turkey about you not going into ber,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,18,Spring,1902
are they still asking about that just say i decided not to in the end and thought you were defending it anyway,1,True,-2,russia,germany,2,19,Spring,1902
may need you supporting me from finland moving in or i‚Äôll just get bounced from uk not sure though,1,True,-2,russia,germany,2,20,Spring,1902
i‚Äôm open to it but don‚Äôt want to commit just yet,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,21,Spring,1902
pretty down tho,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,22,Spring,1902
not going to really be able to do much with that fleet this spring anyway,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,23,Spring,1902
yea ok fucking turkey,1,True,-2,russia,germany,2,24,Spring,1902
i just want to make sure me and france are on the same page before i go all in against england,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,25,Spring,1902
that situation is difficult to figure out as both sides vacated the british channel which is usually contentious territory from turn 1 which makes me think they‚Äôre secretly working together,1,,-2,russia,germany,2,26,Spring,1902
you‚Äôre probably right here,1,,2,germany,russia,2,27,Spring,1902
you‚Äôre not going to do well if you‚Äôre being attacked from the north and the south how about you give me sweden and i‚Äôll lay off you for the game,1,False,2,germany,russia,2,28,Spring,1902
i‚Äôm about to lose anyway,1,True,-2,russia,germany,2,29,Fall,1902
yeah i feel i decide not to bounce you anyway i‚Äôm going to try to take norway from england if that helps any,1,,2,germany,russia,2,30,Fall,1902
would you consider supporting me into norway if i take it i can force england to disband one unit which i  imagine would be it‚Äôs far flung stray st petersburg,1,,2,germany,russia,2,31,Fall,1902
yea sure,1,True,-2,russia,germany,2,32,Fall,1902
support your unit in denmark,1,True,-2,russia,germany,2,33,Fall,1902
nah the fleet in ska,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,34,Fall,1902
gonna have denmark defend,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,35,Fall,1902
let me know you saw this,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,36,Fall,1902
long term i think the best i can do for you is let you keep sweden so you can move your fleet and try to reclaim stp,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,37,Fall,1902
then you can potentially recover a build and stay alive,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,38,Fall,1902
many of the other players seem to have written you off for dead but i am down to do what i can to keep you alive,1,True,2,germany,russia,2,39,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm dead think austria is going after warsaw next turn,1,True,-2,russia,germany,2,40,Fall,1902
yeah i may have to ally with england to stop austria apparently he is the top ranked player in the world,1,,2,germany,russia,2,41,Fall,1902
can you still support me into norway from ska,1,,2,germany,russia,2,42,Fall,1902
negotiations with england are stalled,1,,2,germany,russia,2,43,Fall,1902
hey  are you online,1,,2,germany,russia,2,44,Fall,1902
am now had to retreat from sweden,1,,-2,russia,germany,2,45,Fall,1902
yeah man tough break,1,,12,germany,russia,2,46,Winter,1908
hey england looking forward to this game how are you this afternoon,1,True,0,germany,england,2,0,Spring,1901
hello there i‚Äôm doing well although it‚Äôs the evening here on the east coast wondering where you stand with france and russia will you bounce sweden has france spoken to you about belgium,1,True,0,england,germany,2,1,Spring,1901
east coast for me too üò¥,1,True,0,germany,england,2,2,Spring,1901
france reached out to me but i haven‚Äôt responded,1,True,0,germany,england,2,3,Spring,1901
still determining my plans i haven‚Äôt locked in any moves yet where do you stand with france,1,True,0,germany,england,2,4,Spring,1901
we agreed to bounce the channel but they weren‚Äôt much more communicative than that,1,,0,england,germany,2,5,Spring,1901
france asked me to bounce bur but i haven‚Äôt agreed to it yet that‚Äôs all we‚Äôve communicated,1,True,0,germany,england,2,6,Spring,1901
a lot of players are not very responsive,1,True,0,germany,england,2,7,Spring,1901
where are you based on the east coast i work in dc but i‚Äôm from philly originally,1,True,0,germany,england,2,8,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm in boston but i live in sf originally from boston my work takes me here for about 1 week a month,1,True,0,england,germany,2,9,Spring,1901
you‚Äôre so lucky that your job lets you go home i try to get back to philly once every 6 weeks or so but i have to use my weekends for it,1,True,0,germany,england,2,10,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm actually going to be in palo alto in august i‚Äôve never been in those parts before,1,True,0,germany,england,2,11,Spring,1901
hey england so we have a good deal to chat about are you planning to go into hol nwy,1,True,0,germany,england,2,12,Fall,1901
definitely gonna be taking norway haven‚Äôt decided if fleet or army yet though are you going to bounce russia,0,True,0,england,germany,2,13,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm gonna grab belgium are you taking ruhr or burgundy,1,,0,england,germany,2,14,Fall,1901
ruhr and hol probably,1,False,0,germany,england,2,15,Fall,1901
but i‚Äôm not 100 sure,1,True,0,germany,england,2,16,Fall,1901
i might move mun to ber to protect from russia,1,True,0,germany,england,2,17,Fall,1901
hey there what do you think about pushing further into france with me and italy,1,True,0,england,germany,2,18,Spring,1902
hey i‚Äôm open to it what are your thoughts on sweden,1,True,0,germany,england,2,19,Spring,1902
russia is asking me to support him into sweden i‚Äôd prefer if you just continue to bounce him out so i can grab st pete then you can have sweden,1,True,0,england,germany,2,20,Spring,1902
sound like a plan,1,True,0,england,germany,2,21,Spring,1902
hello,1,True,0,germany,england,2,22,Spring,1902
hi there,1,True,0,england,germany,2,23,Spring,1902
was that a friendly hello before the stab did you have something you wanted to discuss,1,True,0,england,germany,2,24,Fall,1902
yeah i mean i hadn‚Äôt really heard from you so wanted to reach out,1,False,0,germany,england,2,25,Fall,1902
i would like to work something out with you we both have a common rival in france at the moment,1,False,0,germany,england,2,26,Fall,1902
the last message before your hello was me asking you to help me against russia i hadn‚Äôt really heard from you not the other way around did you not receive that message we should talk to the admins if so,1,True,0,england,germany,2,27,Fall,1902
would you be willing to support me into paris,1,True,0,england,germany,2,28,Fall,1902
yes and i responded did you get my response,1,True,0,germany,england,2,29,Fall,1902
i did not,1,True,0,england,germany,2,30,Fall,1902
hmm maybe it was when things were glitchy,1,True,0,germany,england,2,31,Fall,1902
i‚Äôll message the admin well what did you say,1,True,0,england,germany,2,32,Fall,1902
i would screen shot but i feel like that‚Äôs against the rules of the study,1,True,0,germany,england,2,33,Fall,1902
‚Äúhe‚Äôs asking for my support too i‚Äôm not committal i‚Äôm open to it because  he didn‚Äôt screw me in ber last year‚Äù,1,True,0,germany,england,2,34,Fall,1902
that‚Äôs why i stayed out of it,1,True,0,germany,england,2,35,Fall,1902
ok let‚Äôs turn this partnership around,1,True,0,england,germany,2,36,Fall,1902
russia is a goner  austria is the next biggest threat once we deal with france,1,True,0,england,germany,2,37,Fall,1902
can i count on your support into paris,1,True,0,england,germany,2,38,Fall,1902
no i have the unit committed to supporting italy,1,True,0,germany,england,2,39,Fall,1902
ah ok i‚Äôd like to avoid losing a dot if possible looking unlikely i guess,1,True,0,england,germany,2,40,Fall,1902
well that‚Äôs not true,1,True,0,england,germany,2,41,Fall,1902
maybe if i manage to hold norway,1,True,0,england,germany,2,42,Fall,1902
you should grab sweden,1,True,0,england,germany,2,43,Fall,1902
just making sure you got my messages,1,True,0,england,germany,2,44,Fall,1902
yes sorry,1,True,0,germany,england,2,45,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm taking to italy about how we split up france,1,True,0,england,germany,2,46,Fall,1902
any suggestions,1,True,0,england,germany,2,47,Fall,1902
see i don‚Äôt know what i can realistically get out of that scenario,1,True,0,germany,england,2,48,Fall,1902
well you already have belgium and holland paris is all yours  italy can have marseille and spain and i can take brest and portugal what do you think of that then we all head east to face austria and turkey,1,True,0,england,germany,2,49,Fall,1902
that is if austria doesn‚Äôt stab italy first,1,True,0,england,germany,2,50,Fall,1902
and you don‚Äôt stab me,1,True,0,england,germany,2,51,Fall,1902
you heading east goes right through me tho,1,True,0,germany,england,2,52,Fall,1902
no i plan on going through russia i want to land in scandinavia and move from there,1,True,0,england,germany,2,53,Fall,1902
i need an ally near me russia is obviously out the only other option at this stage is france or you france has been very uncommunicative so i‚Äôd like it to be you,1,True,0,england,germany,2,54,Fall,1902
i feel the same way,1,True,0,germany,england,2,55,Fall,1902
i have one additional term i need control of the north sea if i have the north sea i can move my units  in denmark holland and belgium away to focus on supporting other offences i can‚Äôt risk being knifed in the back and cannot keep three units defending against the north sea to feel safe,1,True,0,germany,england,2,56,Fall,1902
i‚Äôve heard that austria is one of the top ranked players in the world did you know this,1,True,0,germany,england,2,57,Fall,1902
i didn‚Äôt know that,1,True,0,england,germany,2,58,Fall,1902
i can‚Äôt leave the north sea open for two reasons the first is the same concern as yours the second is i‚Äôll need it to convoy troops,1,True,0,england,germany,2,59,Fall,1902
could you convoy through the channel you would have my support and i don‚Äôt mean open i mean mine,1,True,0,germany,england,2,60,Fall,1902
i guess i could convoy via norwegian sea but i still have the same concerns that you do except they‚Äôre my home centers,1,True,0,england,germany,2,61,Fall,1902
1 i don‚Äôt blame you for a second,1,True,0,germany,england,2,62,Fall,1902
you are also in a very strong position with 2 fleets in the north,1,,0,england,germany,2,63,Fall,1902
2 i‚Äôm attracted to this alliance because i do not want austria to win it would be so lame if we all lose to the top guy,1,True,0,germany,england,2,64,Fall,1902
it can work but we just need to keep each other in check,1,True,0,england,germany,2,65,Fall,1902
yeah if one of us gets too weak it becomes tempting england germany alliance are very difficult,1,True,0,germany,england,2,66,Fall,1902
austria is going to get two builds it‚Äôs unlikely peace can hold in the east,1,True,0,germany,england,2,67,Fall,1902
with you in the north sea i feel like i can‚Äôt leave denmark or holland undefended but i understand with me there you will feel the same about edinburough and london,1,True,0,germany,england,2,68,Fall,1902
do you know if italy is going to try and take smyrna,1,True,0,england,germany,2,69,Fall,1902
i don‚Äôt,1,True,0,germany,england,2,70,Fall,1902
you‚Äôre correct while it would be nice to be able to move those units east let‚Äôs try and make it work with you staying there,1,True,0,england,germany,2,71,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm not on board with that i can just have two units sitting around doing nothing just to be your pal no offense,1,True,0,germany,england,2,72,Fall,1902
so we let austria roll,1,True,0,england,germany,2,73,Fall,1902
because it will be a grind between us while austria gains momentum,1,True,0,england,germany,2,74,Fall,1902
yeah but sometimes you have to take those kinds of risks,1,True,0,germany,england,2,75,Fall,1902
what about a demilitarised north sea we agree to leave it open,1,True,0,germany,england,2,76,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm way more amenable to that,1,True,0,england,germany,2,77,Fall,1902
that way i think we both get what we want,1,,0,germany,england,2,78,Fall,1902
which is basically trust but verify,1,True,0,germany,england,2,79,Fall,1902
but starting next season i need to convoy into norway this season,1,True,0,england,germany,2,80,Fall,1902
will you be taking sweden,1,True,0,england,germany,2,81,Fall,1902
kinda depends on what we finalise here,1,True,0,germany,england,2,82,Fall,1902
i mean i can russia knows he‚Äôs done that would just be a final nail in the coffin,1,True,0,germany,england,2,83,Fall,1902
ok i‚Äôll be convoying into norway this season next season i move into norwegian sea or channel depending on frances moves,1,True,0,england,germany,2,84,Fall,1902
do you think italy can be pealed away from austria,1,,0,germany,england,2,85,Fall,1902
that‚Äôs gonna be a question we‚Äôll have to face later i have no idea now,1,True,0,england,germany,2,86,Fall,1902
all italy cares about is france right now no clue what his future plans hold,1,True,0,england,germany,2,87,Fall,1902
makes sense he‚Äôs a good player how long do you see these terms holding out does paris still go to me,1,True,0,germany,england,2,88,Fall,1902
this strategy leaves me little room to build outside of heading east which is my concern,1,True,0,germany,england,2,89,Fall,1902
yes you still get paris,1,True,0,england,germany,2,90,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm not really sure i hope we can can see this to the end,1,True,0,england,germany,2,91,Fall,1902
ok,1,True,0,germany,england,2,92,Fall,1902
for the record,1,True,0,germany,england,2,93,Fall,1902
i talked to austria,1,True,0,germany,england,2,94,Fall,1902
and he was trying to talk me into attacking you,1,True,0,germany,england,2,95,Fall,1902
taking the north sea right now,1,True,0,germany,england,2,96,Fall,1902
basically just knifing you while i ‚Äúhave the upper hand‚Äù,1,True,0,germany,england,2,97,Fall,1902
he‚Äôs talking to me to about going after you,0,True,0,england,germany,2,98,Fall,1902
no shit,1,True,0,germany,england,2,99,Fall,1902
what‚Äôs he saying,1,True,0,germany,england,2,100,Fall,1902
lol,1,True,0,england,germany,2,101,Fall,1902
so that‚Äôs why i feel like we need to make this deal,1,True,0,germany,england,2,102,Fall,1902
but perhaps we can be even more clever,1,True,0,germany,england,2,103,Fall,1902
he‚Äôs saying that i need to work with france to make sure you don‚Äôt get too strong,0,,0,england,germany,2,104,Fall,1902
how can we be more clever,1,,0,england,germany,2,105,Fall,1902
basically we have to agree on a strong alliance first,1,True,0,germany,england,2,106,Fall,1902
before we can start playing 4d chess,1,True,0,germany,england,2,107,Fall,1902
italy is a nice guy but as far as i see he is going to be an austria puppet,1,True,0,germany,england,2,108,Fall,1902
you know i‚Äôm all in on it,1,True,0,england,germany,2,109,Fall,1902
i agree,1,True,0,england,germany,2,110,Fall,1902
hell yeah,1,True,0,germany,england,2,111,Fall,1902
i think a simple move is to string austria along as long as possible without raising suspicions of an anglogerman alliance,1,True,0,germany,england,2,112,Fall,1902
this way we can get as much intel we can,1,True,0,germany,england,2,113,Fall,1902
i think i can say i took sweden instead of the north sea because i wanted another build maybe he‚Äôll think i‚Äôm a noob i don‚Äôt know any better and will only be moderately suspicious,1,True,0,germany,england,2,114,Fall,1902
but how do i know you‚Äôre actually in and not just playing me,1,True,0,germany,england,2,115,Fall,1902
hello i‚Äôm already nervous you‚Äôre like reporting all this to austria haha,1,True,0,germany,england,2,116,Fall,1902
sorry,1,False,0,england,germany,2,117,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm facetiming with my gf and she gets kissed when i click over to discord,1,True,0,england,germany,2,118,Fall,1902
we are 100 on,1,True,0,england,germany,2,119,Fall,1902
hahahah dude i‚Äôm about to ft my gf too,1,True,0,germany,england,2,120,Fall,1902
so you understand,1,True,0,england,germany,2,121,Fall,1902
okay i‚Äôm going to trust you a radical thing to do in this game,1,True,0,germany,england,2,122,Fall,1902
of course bro,1,True,0,germany,england,2,123,Fall,1902
let‚Äôs take down austria i‚Äôm gonna tell italy that we are iffy and have some trouble in case he‚Äôs reporting to austria,1,True,0,england,germany,2,124,Fall,1902
basically just to be clear i see this as a long term alliance to stop austria from my pov it‚Äôs not about me or you winning ourselves but about having someone other than this top ranked player beat all of us,1,True,0,germany,england,2,125,Fall,1902
hell yeah,1,True,0,germany,england,2,126,Fall,1902
100,1,True,0,england,germany,2,127,Fall,1902
also honestly this will be more fun if you‚Äôre working together like total hand in glove with someone,1,True,0,germany,england,2,128,Fall,1902
plus think about the diplomatic advantage of us being able to triangulate intel,1,,0,germany,england,2,129,Fall,1902
good looks with italy,1,True,0,germany,england,2,130,Fall,1902
hey man what‚Äôs going on with your supporting order into bur,1,True,0,germany,england,2,131,Fall,1902
complete oversight i had my orders like that before we came to our agreement between talking to you and italy and austria and my gf last night i forgot to change them up my bad,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,132,Winter,1902
that‚Äôs why there was a useless support of north sea as well,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,133,Winter,1902
i should have moved london to the channel,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,134,Winter,1902
okay no worries at all i‚Äôll take your word for it totally but it kinda put me on alert that‚Äôs all,1,True,2,germany,england,2,135,Winter,1902
and yeah like 45 minutes before the turn ended i still had my dudes invading norway lol so no sweat,1,True,2,germany,england,2,136,Winter,1902
basically no harm done but like if you do fuck me instead of my mission being kill austria it‚Äôs gonna change to you lol,1,True,2,germany,england,2,137,Winter,1902
def don‚Äôt wasn‚Äôt that tho,1,True,2,germany,england,2,138,Winter,1902
want,1,True,2,germany,england,2,139,Winter,1902
absolutely i‚Äôm still team kill austria and maybe italy,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,140,Winter,1902
i‚Äôd love to peak italy away from austria but there‚Äôs only so much we can do,1,True,2,germany,england,2,141,Winter,1902
peal,1,True,2,germany,england,2,142,Winter,1902
i‚Äôm gonna be super busy tomorrow so down to tan through some moves now i would love to pick up warsaw and paris this turn so i can have the strength to blitzkrieg into austria,1,True,2,germany,england,2,143,Winter,1902
gonna need your help with nonaggression in the north sea can you move your fleet to the norwegian sea next turn,1,True,2,germany,england,2,144,Winter,1902
there‚Äôs definitely going to be a target on my back,1,True,2,germany,england,2,145,Winter,1902
any interest in supporting me into paris,1,True,2,germany,england,2,146,Spring,1903
i‚Äôm about to take off for a flight and probably won‚Äôt land before adjudication i‚Äôll support you into laris and move from the north sea but i need builds,1,,-2,england,germany,2,147,Spring,1903
clutch thanks,1,True,2,germany,england,2,148,Spring,1903
i can help where needed,1,True,2,germany,england,2,149,Spring,1903
actually i can‚Äôt support,1,,-2,england,germany,2,150,Spring,1903
i need that to move on brest,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,151,Spring,1903
but i will move from north sea,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,152,Spring,1903
i‚Äôll support you in next season,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,153,Spring,1903
taking off god speed,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,154,Spring,1903
hmm maybe don‚Äôt move north sea might spoke austria and italy,1,True,2,germany,england,2,155,Spring,1903
this is gonna be awesome,1,True,2,germany,england,2,156,Fall,1903
oh shit,1,True,2,germany,england,2,157,Fall,1903
do you think france will retreat to the north sea if you take the channel,1,True,2,germany,england,2,158,Fall,1903
that could fuck up everything,1,True,2,germany,england,2,159,Fall,1903
additionally if and only if you feel comfortable with it i‚Äôm happy to move my fleet into position to help you with the battle of the channel and to try to rout france from slipping into the irish sea or worse the norwegian sea russia is going to lose that fleet next turn i‚Äôm assuming so i literally won‚Äôt have anything to do with my two fleets if prefer to use them to help you in the west and to potentially convoy your units as needed,1,True,2,germany,england,2,160,Fall,1903
i would also talk to turkey about what is going to happen in moscow,1,True,2,germany,england,2,161,Fall,1903
damn i wish we could call people rather than text but hey whatever,1,True,2,germany,england,2,162,Fall,1903
it‚Äôs going to be hard to pull italy away from austria we have to really strategize how we pull the ultimate stab we should gently work on loosening italy from austria but be prepared in case that doesn‚Äôt happen,1,True,2,germany,england,2,163,Fall,1903
also no worries at all if not but if you could support me into paris that would be dope no worries if you can‚Äôt at all,1,True,2,germany,england,2,164,Fall,1903
let me know if you‚Äôre cool with me temporarily putting my fleet in ska in the north sea to block off france france retreating their will screw things up big time i have it set to move there right now but i‚Äôll call it off immediately if you tell me to,1,True,2,germany,england,2,165,Fall,1903
yeah i‚Äôm pretty uncomfortable with you in the north sea,1,,-2,england,germany,2,166,Fall,1903
let me think for a sec,1,,-2,england,germany,2,167,Fall,1903
we can bounce north sea,1,,-2,england,germany,2,168,Fall,1903
i‚Äôm game that serves the same end,1,True,2,germany,england,2,169,Fall,1903
it means i don‚Äôt force channel though,1,,-2,england,germany,2,170,Fall,1903
right that was my thought too,1,True,2,germany,england,2,171,Fall,1903
i guess it just has to be that way,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,172,Fall,1903
can you move ska to bal,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,173,Fall,1903
i mean den,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,174,Fall,1903
ska was gonna bounce the north sea,1,True,2,germany,england,2,175,Fall,1903
yeah i‚Äôm dumb,1,,-2,england,germany,2,176,Fall,1903
did you work out warsaw with austria,1,,-2,england,germany,2,177,Fall,1903
i mean he‚Äôs not protesting me going after it but in all likelihood i won‚Äôt get it till spring,1,True,2,germany,england,2,178,Fall,1903
we kinda need to make a big play in spring 1905 before turkey is totally destroyed,1,True,2,germany,england,2,179,Fall,1903
will he support you in,1,,-2,england,germany,2,180,Fall,1903
turkey is supporting me into moscow in exchange for support in sev,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,181,Fall,1903
why did you move to ska,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,182,Fall,1903
all that does is threaten norway needlessly,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,183,Fall,1903
accidental move,1,False,2,germany,england,2,184,Fall,1903
i mean to go bal but it‚Äôs kinda inconsequential to me i really don‚Äôt have anything for those guys to do,1,False,2,germany,england,2,185,Fall,1903
except threaten me,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,186,Fall,1903
but yeah i don‚Äôt blame you for feeling suspicious,1,True,2,germany,england,2,187,Fall,1903
yeah dude really total oversight i‚Äôm committed to this alliance,1,True,2,germany,england,2,188,Fall,1903
how can you rectify it,1,False,-2,england,germany,2,189,Fall,1903
if you‚Äôre scared i‚Äôm happy to set something you like as good faith but i think i‚Äôve been pretty accurate to my word,1,True,2,germany,england,2,190,Fall,1903
gez man,1,True,2,germany,england,2,191,Fall,1903
whatever you want i literally have nothing to do with these units,1,True,2,germany,england,2,192,Fall,1903
i get it tho i felt the same last turn but like i don‚Äôt want these kinda things to totally throw us off i‚Äôm  banking on you help stop austria and definitely have placed my trust in you,1,True,2,germany,england,2,193,Fall,1903
12 hours days,1,True,2,germany,england,2,194,Fall,1903
i‚Äôm at a conference for work and can‚Äôt really pay too much attention to this rn,1,True,2,germany,england,2,195,Fall,1903
but like in sort,1,True,2,germany,england,2,196,Fall,1903
i‚Äôll do what you want,1,True,2,germany,england,2,197,Fall,1903
but i don‚Äôt like this tone of ‚Äúhow will you rectify‚Äù like i don‚Äôt want any tension here,1,True,2,germany,england,2,198,Fall,1903
ok fair enough i had one of those days too it‚Äôs a suspicious move but as long as we can figure out a way to get you back in denmark we‚Äôre cool,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,199,Fall,1903
i‚Äôm totally game,1,True,2,germany,england,2,200,Fall,1903
and like i said no hard feelings here either i think we‚Äôve both really committed to working together and so we‚Äôre hypersensitive to getting stabbed,1,True,2,germany,england,2,201,Fall,1903
here‚Äôs my orders as they are set right now burpar hold in bel kieruh berpru silwar skaden hold sweden,1,True,2,germany,england,2,202,Fall,1903
honestly it might be best to make a habit out of sharing and confirming our movesets to avoid problems like this that way if there is a stab there are no two ways about it,1,True,2,germany,england,2,203,Fall,1903
another thought  maybe we agree that if we want to break the alliance after austria is subdued we have a one term armistice so we can regroup and prepare once again to reduce risk of stab,1,True,2,germany,england,2,204,Fall,1903

if russia is smart he‚Äôll disband warsaw because it‚Äôs dead no matter what that will be annoying for st pete but we‚Äôll see,1,,-1,england,germany,2,207,Winter,1903
austria is nervous of you he‚Äôs asking me to not support you into warsaw i‚Äôm playing very coy happy to support you in but if you think we can use this for some duplicity why it try i could tell him i‚Äôll help him out to keep him on my side for now he sees that you will be ‚Äúpointlessly moving east‚Äù and you are a ‚Äúpoor player who doesn‚Äôt deserve warsaw‚Äù clearly some threat there,1,,-1,england,germany,2,208,Winter,1903
hahahah now i really want him dead,1,True,1,germany,england,2,209,Winter,1903
like why a dick does he think that we want his respect because he‚Äôs some highly ranked dude bs as long as he loses i‚Äôm happy,1,True,1,germany,england,2,210,Winter,1903

austria is telling me things you apparently said about me,1,True,1,germany,england,2,224,Spring,1904
trying to provoke me to attack you,1,True,1,germany,england,2,225,Spring,1904
i haven‚Äôt said a word to him,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,226,Spring,1904
keeping him in the dark,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,227,Spring,1904

ok now he‚Äôs trying to convince me that the only place for expansion is through you are you not planning on moving on him i‚Äôm surprised you didn‚Äôt move into munich,1,False,-1,england,germany,2,229,Spring,1904
i‚Äôm moving on him in the spring after i get my two new builds i don‚Äôt want to arouse too much suspicion before the blitzkrieg,1,True,1,germany,england,2,230,Fall,1904
so the plan is army in munich and army in berlin will you support pic into brest,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,231,Fall,1904
yes i‚Äôve already set my orders to do so,1,True,1,germany,england,2,232,Fall,1904
and yes army in mun and ber,1,True,1,germany,england,2,233,Fall,1904
still wanna share orders,1,,-1,england,germany,2,234,Fall,1904
yeah for sure especially if we‚Äôre going to turn on austria soon we should be coordinating clearly,1,True,1,germany,england,2,235,Fall,1904
have you been talking to italy or turkey,1,True,1,germany,england,2,236,Fall,1904

i was supporting armenia to sev,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,244,Fall,1904
nice i think we should protect the north seas because a rouge french fleet will be a big distraction from the austria front,1,True,1,germany,england,2,245,Fall,1904
updated my orders i‚Äôm now supporting you in moscow,1,True,1,germany,england,2,246,Fall,1904
italy is telling me that you and austria will team against me in warsaw i think this is austria trying to bait me into acting against you or him,1,True,1,germany,england,2,247,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm going to bounce france out of the north sea baring protest from you i will remove my fleet from the north sea once it is not needed to protect from france,1,True,1,germany,england,2,248,Fall,1904

i need some strategy help,1,,-1,england,germany,2,252,Fall,1904
i needed to convince austria not to take moscow in told him i wouldn‚Äôt support turkey into sev if he didn‚Äôt take moscow and then we could talk about moving against you the truth is i still plan on supporting turkey however i don‚Äôt have much of a plan after that we need more armies up north,1,,-1,england,germany,2,253,Fall,1904
i just realized that for that to work warsaw needs to hit ukraine,1,,-1,england,germany,2,254,Fall,1904
is that possible,1,,-1,england,germany,2,255,Fall,1904
geez so many moving parts here,1,,-1,england,germany,2,256,Fall,1904
if i don‚Äôt hear from you 5 minutes before adjudication i‚Äôll just hold moscow and deal with turkey and sev next year,1,,-1,england,germany,2,257,Fall,1904
hey just got out of a meeting,1,True,1,germany,england,2,258,Fall,1904
glad to hear from you,1,,-1,england,germany,2,259,Fall,1904
my fear is that by hitting ukraine i provoke austria and become the aggressor that makes it unlikely we can convince italy to stay neutral at this point i am almost hoping austria attacks me in some way so i can claim retaliation and blitzkrieg,1,True,1,germany,england,2,260,Fall,1904
just read my message from austria he is thinking about taking moscow,1,True,1,germany,england,2,261,Fall,1904
he said ‚Äúbecause i am not hearing from england‚Äù this was 905 am est so i assumed you have hammered it out since then,1,True,1,germany,england,2,262,Fall,1904
assume,1,True,1,germany,england,2,263,Fall,1904
unless he stabs yes,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,264,Fall,1904
sweet if he does stab then we have an excuse to invade,1,True,1,germany,england,2,265,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm not going to try and convince you to move against austria if you don‚Äôt want to i do think however that if we can knock him out of sev we are on a much better strategic position i‚Äôll plan on holding moscow unless you say otherwise,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,266,Fall,1904
what can i do to knock him out of sev on this turn,1,True,1,germany,england,2,267,Fall,1904
i totally agree there is nothing i rather do than deny him another build,1,True,1,germany,england,2,268,Fall,1904
but i don‚Äôt see how i can possibly stop him this turn i had the same conversation with turkey,1,True,1,germany,england,2,269,Fall,1904
you hit ukraine i support armenia into sev black supports armenia,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,270,Fall,1904
damn this is a tough call,1,True,1,germany,england,2,271,Fall,1904
well you let me know what you want to do and i‚Äôll plan around it it‚Äôs all up to you,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,272,Fall,1904
maybe it‚Äôs time to just go ahead and make the first strike i alert him to my intentions but deny him a build which is far more important,1,True,1,germany,england,2,273,Fall,1904
still the trade off is now he will be able to move against me in spring 1905 and that might be a big advantage,1,True,1,germany,england,2,274,Fall,1904
but your builds will protect against that no don‚Äôt forget that by doing this turkey is still a contender,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,275,Fall,1904
so with this move his army in sev is forced to disband,1,True,1,germany,england,2,276,Fall,1904
right,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,277,Fall,1904
so do i hold or support,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,278,Fall,1904
if i hit austria what does our spring 1905 strategy look like,1,True,1,germany,england,2,279,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm playing around with the sandbox,1,True,1,germany,england,2,280,Fall,1904
our odds are better if italy stays out of it if we go all out on austria we need you and turkey to be strong it‚Äôs going to be intense in no mans land and everything will come down to who‚Äôs line breaks first,1,True,1,germany,england,2,281,Fall,1904
we‚Äôll have austria squished,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,282,Fall,1904
either i build armies and funnel through scandinavia to help you or build fleets and take on italy,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,283,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm nervous but i think it‚Äôs time to take the plunge this is minus one for austria and plus one for our ally,1,True,1,germany,england,2,284,Fall,1904

if you think we‚Äôll have a better opportunity later we can do that i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs gonna happen next but it feels like this is a good spot,1,True,-1,england,germany,2,289,Fall,1904
i think you are right rationally my concern is twofold 1 we will most likely force a hostile italy i‚Äôm sure that would have happened any way but we destroy any possibility  2 we give austria a heads up he will defending the neutral ground,1,True,1,germany,england,2,290,Fall,1904
yeah actually,1,True,1,germany,england,2,291,Fall,1904
we can‚Äôt do it this turn i‚Äôm sorry once i get the jump on him in the spring i can force him to disband plus give you more time to bring units over,1,True,1,germany,england,2,292,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm going to play it conservatively here and not stab,1,,1,germany,england,2,293,Fall,1904

we avoided prematurely springing ww3 by the skin of our teeth,1,True,3,germany,england,2,298,Winter,1904
we should get thinking about what the next move is we‚Äôre lucky that we have the build phase now so we have 36 hours to brainstorm the best move and gather more intel    i would love to work out a scenario where italy remains neutral but assuming that won‚Äôt happen i think you‚Äôll have to be prepared to keep him busy in the west cleaning up the ruins of france,1,True,3,germany,england,2,299,Winter,1904
perhaps i can convoy your army in london to norway and you can begin to sweep him in,1,True,3,germany,england,2,300,Winter,1904
i was thinking the same thing reconvoying to norway i need to find a couple builds brest is a lock and i‚Äôll have to make sure italy is still on board with giving me portugal i‚Äôd like to see more of my fleets pushing into the med and more of your armies pushing east i don‚Äôt have time to think about precise moves but just general strategy,1,,-3,england,germany,2,301,Winter,1904
yes i agree i don‚Äôt want to do it before we‚Äôre ready but i don‚Äôt want to wait until austria has killed turkey,1,True,3,germany,england,2,302,Winter,1904

can you see anywhere for me to expand that isn‚Äôt austria i assume he‚Äôs going to try to pressure me into attacking you,1,True,3,germany,england,2,304,Winter,1904
that‚Äôs my impetus for attacking asap the longer i wait the stronger austria grows while i stagnate,1,True,3,germany,england,2,305,Winter,1904
i‚Äôm in the same boat my man austria is the only way for you to expand other than through me i have to bust through france and italy this is a tough alliance but i‚Äôm committed to making it work,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,306,Winter,1904
oh yeah attacking each other is not an option but i think moving on austria asap is,1,True,3,germany,england,2,307,Winter,1904
sorry hope that was clear,1,True,3,germany,england,2,308,Winter,1904

here‚Äôs what i‚Äôm thinking,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,311,Spring,1905
from austria ‚Äúdid you ask germany to move into the north sea if not i‚Äôm all in with you he‚Äôs the largest on the map now with free access to norway and edinburgh let‚Äôs go after him‚Äù,1,,-3,england,germany,2,312,Spring,1905
any ideas on how to spin,1,,-3,england,germany,2,313,Spring,1905
hmm let me think about it this could be gold tho,1,True,3,germany,england,2,314,Spring,1905
if we can somehow spin a narrative that austria is going after me and breaking out alliance we may win over italy,1,True,3,germany,england,2,315,Spring,1905
what are you thinking,1,True,3,germany,england,2,316,Spring,1905
i think we can force sev now with turkey so long as he‚Äôs not a donkey,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,317,Spring,1905
yeah let‚Äôs discuss with him and put together a foolproof plan,1,True,3,germany,england,2,318,Spring,1905
i‚Äôm kinda busy this evening so i hope you guys can put together a good strategy,1,True,3,germany,england,2,319,Spring,1905
im talking to him now,1,,-3,england,germany,2,320,Spring,1905
plan on hitting ukraine,1,,-3,england,germany,2,321,Spring,1905
turkey is starting to back down,1,,-3,england,germany,2,322,Spring,1905
what do you think if i take warsaw from you with austiras help to gain some trust from him,1,False,-3,england,germany,2,323,Spring,1905
just thinking out loud here,1,,-3,england,germany,2,324,Spring,1905
um i think that‚Äôs a horrible idea,1,True,3,germany,england,2,325,Spring,1905
i have a material advantage over austria now why blow it,1,True,3,germany,england,2,326,Spring,1905
ok fair,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,327,Spring,1905
turkey is back on board,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,328,Spring,1905

yo can we do this in the fall i want to take gal so i can take vienna in the fall,1,,3,germany,england,2,330,Spring,1905
if i don‚Äôt take gal i risk losing warsaw,1,,3,germany,england,2,331,Spring,1905
austria is going to take warsaw from me if we don‚Äôt plan carefully here i think you should support warsaw as i move my unit into gal then the following turn i will attack the ukraine and open the path for turkey to recover,1,,3,germany,england,2,332,Spring,1905
can you get on board with that full disclosure i feel kinda shakey since you suggested supporting austria into warsaw,1,,3,germany,england,2,333,Spring,1905

oh shit dude my bad on norway i didn‚Äôt look closely enough at your orders happy to convoy your armies but definitely specifically ask me to do it and make sure i confirm or i might miss it,1,False,3,germany,england,2,352,Spring,1905
i‚Äôm glad austria decided to hit me as well i think italy will stay neutral perhaps even lean towards our side,1,True,3,germany,england,2,353,Spring,1905
glad that i at least got him to mess up your convoy lol,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,354,Spring,1905
that was from austira,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,355,Spring,1905
i mean he did succeed there,1,,3,germany,england,2,356,Spring,1905
at least he‚Äôs openly at war with us now,1,,3,germany,england,2,357,Spring,1905
sorry we have to be very explicit with our coordination,1,,3,germany,england,2,358,Spring,1905
man austria sucks we gotta wreck him,1,,3,germany,england,2,359,Spring,1905
hes implying that you purposefully didnt convoy,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,360,Spring,1905
why in god‚Äôs name would i do that,1,True,3,germany,england,2,361,Spring,1905
what went wrong here is that we sent each other our move set but didn‚Äôt look closely enough,1,False,3,germany,england,2,362,Spring,1905
also if you need me to convoy i‚Äôm happy to do it but you should specifically ask for it,1,True,3,germany,england,2,363,Spring,1905
austria is right tho dude  i was so freaked out last night that he used me real name i was off my game,1,True,3,germany,england,2,364,Spring,1905
like that still creeps me out tbh,1,True,3,germany,england,2,365,Spring,1905
i just set me orders to convoy you this turn assuming things are still good here,1,True,3,germany,england,2,366,Fall,1905
ok,1,False,-3,england,germany,2,367,Fall,1905
how does he know your name,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,368,Fall,1905
dude i have no idea,1,True,3,germany,england,2,369,Fall,1905
he just like used it randomly in the convo and i have no idea who he is,1,True,3,germany,england,2,370,Fall,1905
are you part of a diplomacy teams group  because if youve played a lot of gunboat games through that app real name is attached to dip name,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,371,Fall,1905
perhaps that‚Äôs it but still how would he know that i‚Äôm germany in this game,1,True,3,germany,england,2,372,Fall,1905
either way it was a wack gambit that really bugged me out,1,True,3,germany,england,2,373,Fall,1905
like he thought using my irl name would get me to trust him,1,True,3,germany,england,2,374,Fall,1905
but are you and i good,1,True,3,germany,england,2,375,Fall,1905
yes  as long as after the convoy you move out of n sea,1,False,-3,england,germany,2,376,Fall,1905
like i sent you my orders last night exactly as they adjudicated so it‚Äôs not like i was hiding something,1,,3,germany,england,2,377,Fall,1905
okay word,1,,3,germany,england,2,378,Fall,1905
italy is asking how he can take portgual and i reminded him that portugal was supposed to be mine  this might be where things turn between me and him,1,,-3,england,germany,2,379,Fall,1905
but you cannot move into the north sea either tho,1,True,3,germany,england,2,380,Fall,1905
no neither of us are supposed to be there,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,381,Fall,1905
yes exactly good glad we‚Äôre on the same page,1,True,3,germany,england,2,382,Fall,1905
it made sense to block france and i appreciate you trusting me to park there temporarily,1,True,3,germany,england,2,383,Fall,1905
austria is ajax on discord  i just put that together by his profile pic  i dont know who ajax is irl,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,384,Fall,1905

‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt have trust before you thought we had trust that is the foundational mirage of diplomacy‚Äù,1,True,3,germany,england,2,388,Fall,1905
wtf,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,389,Fall,1905
i just found that stuff offputting,1,True,3,germany,england,2,390,Fall,1905
like weird way to double down on already making me feel weird,1,True,3,germany,england,2,391,Fall,1905
austria‚Äôs only path to survival here is to convince you or italy to attack me,1,True,3,germany,england,2,392,Fall,1905
are we waiting on retreats still,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,393,Fall,1905
ya i think so,1,True,3,germany,england,2,394,Fall,1905
this turn exceeded my expectations,1,True,3,germany,england,2,395,Fall,1905
turkey retook sev and i snagged vie,1,True,3,germany,england,2,396,Fall,1905

sev can‚Äôt fall,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,421,Fall,1906
taking ukraine allows me to open up another line of attack on austria and support and protect turkey,1,True,3,germany,england,2,422,Fall,1906
ok we‚Äôll we should do it in the spring so that if he ends up taking sev we have an opportunity to take it back,1,True,-3,england,germany,2,423,Fall,1906

the lines are going to get entrenched soon,1,,-3,england,germany,2,434,Fall,1906
we‚Äôll have to use some diplomacy skills to get italy on our side,1,,-3,england,germany,2,435,Fall,1906

like i‚Äôve always said my primary goal is beating austria hahaha,1,True,2,germany,england,2,447,Spring,1907

you have nothing to fear in him anyways,1,True,-2,england,germany,2,450,Spring,1907
it‚Äôs not looking good but if he teams with austria he can really slow me down,1,True,2,germany,england,2,451,Spring,1907
he could slow me down with austria at least let me get a foothold in tyr and ukraine and pick up one more austrian sc before turning on italy,1,True,2,germany,england,2,452,Spring,1907
i really just want one enemy to focus on,1,True,2,germany,england,2,453,Spring,1907

no i havent either,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,7,Spring,1901
only person i haven‚Äôt talked to so i don‚Äôt have anything for you i shared a lot of small talk with austria  seems like a nice guy but we won‚Äôt have much shop to talk for the first couple turns,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,8,Spring,1901
yeah i think youll be fine with austria initially,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,9,Spring,1901
have you talked to france much,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,10,Spring,1901
i inquired about italy a little bit but not so much about other plans,0,True,0,turkey,germany,2,11,Spring,1901
how‚Äôs it going turkey,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,12,Fall,1901
it does seem like russia has a deal with austria i was expecting a war  gal at least for some control on rumania,1,,0,turkey,germany,2,13,Fall,1901
what do you think about austria and italy though,1,,0,turkey,germany,2,14,Fall,1901
they seem like nice guys very chatty,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,15,Fall,1901
they seem like nice guys very chatty,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,16,Fall,1901
right i agree russia seems to be going after me,1,False,0,germany,turkey,2,17,Fall,1901
why did the army in pru halt,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,18,Winter,1901
also its clear that austria is going to build 2 units in tri and vie i think you should be cautious now that rusia may withdraw some troops to sev,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,19,Winter,1901
he thought i was going to defend and decided not to anyway,0,,0,germany,turkey,2,20,Spring,1902
possibly i‚Äôm more focused on france and england at the moment,1,,0,germany,turkey,2,21,Spring,1902
okay good luck with that i think russia will move back for now so thatll hopefully be helpful int the short term,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,22,Spring,1902
looks like russia is finished any plans for the future im not sure how long i can hold out here,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,23,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm still deciding what to do in scandinavia,1,False,0,germany,turkey,2,24,Fall,1902
well if austria grabs warsaw russia will probably disband that fleet,1,,0,turkey,germany,2,25,Fall,1902
so just take sweden,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,26,Fall,1902
yeah or you f den s f ska  swe,1,,0,turkey,germany,2,27,Fall,1902
yeah i wouldn‚Äôt mind keeping russia alive on life support,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,28,Fall,1902
or the same for norway perhaps that england scares you more,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,29,Fall,1902
exactly,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,30,Fall,1902
just note that stp can suport f nth  nwy,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,31,Fall,1902
thanks for the reminder,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,32,Fall,1902
omg,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,33,Fall,1902
üòÉ,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,34,Fall,1902
i could bait england to doing that then snipe the north sea lol,1,,0,germany,turkey,2,35,Fall,1902
so unless russia cuts support,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,36,Fall,1902
but perhaps he is vengeful and willing to help im not sure,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,37,Fall,1902
well he could even just convoy to norway and support that,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,38,Fall,1902
if you disrupt the convoy then clearly you are not attacking norway,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,39,Fall,1902
yeah,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,40,Fall,1902
if he is distracted with f nth though it is likely france can move into the channel,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,41,Fall,1902
is that so bad,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,42,Fall,1902
man austria is gonna win this isn‚Äôt he,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,43,Fall,1902
its not bad for you since france seems to want use that to invade england perhaps,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,44,Fall,1902
exactly,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,45,Fall,1902
but he made a big mistake with moves in spring,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,46,Fall,1902
austria,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,47,Fall,1902
or france,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,48,Fall,1902
france i think the a spa mar got stopped,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,49,Fall,1902
and that cascaded to portugal,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,50,Fall,1902
if he had moved a spagas and a porspa he could easily a gas s a spa  mar now,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,51,Fall,1902
yup ,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,52,Fall,1902
well except for your dude there,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,53,Fall,1902
italy wants my support into france,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,54,Fall,1902
anyhow we should try to sort something with italy if we can in case austria gets too strong,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,55,Fall,1902
those two are tight,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,56,Fall,1902
not entirely he did not move f nap  ion,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,57,Fall,1902
which wouldve been very bad for me since he could then convoy to syr,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,58,Fall,1902
im trying to win him over and i think he realizes too that if austria gets the whole east that doesnt bode well,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,59,Fall,1902
he claimed to be the 1 diplomacy player online to me too,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,60,Fall,1902
idk if thats true but i wouldnt underestimate him,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,61,Fall,1902
austria,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,62,Fall,1902
yep,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,63,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm not surprised admin told me that someone in here is the top player,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,64,Fall,1902
what if we all just ganged up even if i lose knowing i helped beat the best player in the world would be dope lol,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,65,Fall,1902
i mean ill believe it he got all of germany russia italy on his hand for the first few years p,1,False,0,turkey,germany,2,66,Fall,1902
yeah i basically had the same idea üòÉ well except for the losing part,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,67,Fall,1902
mwhhaha,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,68,Fall,1902
dang,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,69,Fall,1902
like once you sort things out with franceengland youll be frree to move east i can probably survive a few turns but anyway you should not expect the peac in the east to last especially since austria will get 1 or 2 builds in winter,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,70,Fall,1902
i agree,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,71,Fall,1902
do you have any ideas on how to free up some resources,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,72,Fall,1902
my resources,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,73,Fall,1902
a deal with england where i get the north sea,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,74,Fall,1902
ok but hed want a way to get his troops across into france at least so he needs the channel,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,75,Fall,1902
i dont he will be satisfied to twiddle his thumbs in pic,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,76,Fall,1902
think,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,77,Fall,1902
perhaps a situation where both of you dont occupy nth is ok,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,78,Fall,1902
then there is a buffer zone both ways,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,79,Fall,1902
actually its probably fast to ally with france but its up to you,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,80,Fall,1902
yeah that was my original plan but he‚Äôs unresponsive,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,81,Fall,1902
my other option is to just gun for england it risks an austria win but could allow me rapid growth especially if i take norway and then the north sea next turn,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,82,Fall,1902
yeah though im inclined to think he will move his fleet to norway since its fall but in effect he will be giving up the channel allowing france to move his troops,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,83,Fall,1902
either way england is weakened,1,True,0,turkey,germany,2,84,Fall,1902
exactly i still get one build sucks that i can‚Äôt focus on austria but his terms were not sufficient,1,True,0,germany,turkey,2,85,Fall,1902
good luck then ill try to not die,1,,0,turkey,germany,2,86,Fall,1902
okay you‚Äôre idea actually revived talks,1,,0,germany,turkey,2,87,Fall,1902
an open north sea armistice,1,,0,germany,turkey,2,88,Fall,1902
hey you still online,1,,0,germany,turkey,2,89,Fall,1902
im back,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,90,Winter,1902
id like to make some plans with regards to austria if you are able to help out,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,91,Winter,1902
totally in,1,True,2,germany,turkey,2,92,Winter,1902
cool,1,,-2,turkey,germany,2,93,Spring,1903
if you can make a move toward warsaw to begin with that would be beneficial to both of us i think,1,,-2,turkey,germany,2,94,Spring,1903
as soon as austria has to take 1 or two armies off to protect the west i think i can push in a little bit,1,,-2,turkey,germany,2,95,Spring,1903
yes i‚Äôm attacking warsaw this turn and will take it by next turn at the latest austria is going to support italy into smyrna or at least that‚Äôs what he told me,1,True,2,germany,turkey,2,96,Fall,1903
i want to take paris and warsaw next turn once i have those two extra builds russia is largely taken by england and france is put to bed my plan is to move on austria i don‚Äôt want italy to turn against us but if he does i was england to be strong enough to help hold him off,1,True,2,germany,turkey,2,97,Fall,1903
i would have a conversation with england about what will happen with moscow he is a friend and i trust him,1,False,2,germany,turkey,2,98,Fall,1903
good luck on everything man the longer you can hold out the more time england and i have to build,1,True,2,germany,turkey,2,99,Fall,1903
im not sure if this is a good plan maybe you can cut a gal s rum such that i can a sev  rum with support from bla,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,100,Fall,1903
this turn,1,True,2,germany,turkey,2,101,Fall,1903
yeah im not sure if you have anything else you want to do with a sil ,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,102,Fall,1903
or maybe keep up appearances,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,103,Fall,1903
gonna give warsaw a shot,1,True,2,germany,turkey,2,104,Fall,1903
exactly my plan is to let me and england get as strong as possible while austria thinks we‚Äôre his pals,1,False,2,germany,turkey,2,105,Fall,1903
if either me or england attack moscow the attack on warsaw will fail,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,106,Fall,1903
if i dont get  1 command center this turn i will need to disband 1 unit and austria gets plus 1 im quite scared of caving in with just 4 units,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,107,Fall,1903
i‚Äôm scared too tbh i feel like you‚Äôre churchill here and if you lose that unit it could be the beginning of the end,1,True,2,germany,turkey,2,108,Fall,1903
ive made a few bets and its allowed me to survive so far but some time the coin will land on the other side,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,109,Fall,1903
i‚Äôm hoping you can keep him busy until spring 1905,1,,2,germany,turkey,2,110,Fall,1903
that may be wishful thinking,1,,2,germany,turkey,2,111,Fall,1903
but i don‚Äôt feel prepared for a full assault yet,1,,2,germany,turkey,2,112,Fall,1903
still if your just hanging on once we start hitting him from the north and east you might be able to reclaim builds quickly,1,,2,germany,turkey,2,113,Fall,1903
i think the best path forward is to wait and see what happens this turn and if things get too hairy we gotta pull the trigger,1,True,2,germany,turkey,2,114,Fall,1903
like if this turn i bet wrong on whats gonna attack what ill probably lose another center,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,115,Fall,1903
2 instead of 1 or just one,1,True,2,germany,turkey,2,116,Fall,1903
we may be able to work out some intel,1,False,2,germany,turkey,2,117,Fall,1903
im not sure austria would feel compelled to give you accurate intel on the moves in the southeast,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,118,Fall,1903
right but we may be able to get something even if he lies we can potentially make deductions from his lies do you guys talk at all,1,True,2,germany,turkey,2,119,Fall,1903
barely for the opposite reason me giving away stuff,0,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,120,Fall,1903
also england has never responded to me,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,121,Fall,1903
ive also been amazed at how deaf italy has been to my chat about him having nothing to gain from austria winning basically all of turkey,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,122,Fall,1903
yes why is italy so strongly joined at the hip with austria it seems unlikely that we will be able to pry him away unfortunately,1,True,2,germany,turkey,2,123,Fall,1903
on multiple occasions has he been vaguely agreeable with my arguments to then try to stab me anyhow,1,,-2,turkey,germany,2,124,Fall,1903
also like if your intel on the smy attack is correct that changes a lot of things for me in options,1,,-2,turkey,germany,2,125,Fall,1903
like from the outset that seems a relatively risky choice,1,,-2,turkey,germany,2,126,Fall,1903
well at least theres a way to force a stalemate from this position but i still lose 1 dude and austria gains one,1,,-2,turkey,germany,2,127,Fall,1903
italy supposedly is upset with austria well see how it goes,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,2,128,Fall,1903
really why do you think it‚Äôs a ploy if we can enlist italy then there is no reason not to move on austria immediately,1,True,3,germany,turkey,2,129,Winter,1903
hes claimed to want to move against austria in various ways before to then try to stab me anyway it had been only plays for me to lower my guard i wouldnt trust him unless he makes the first move,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,130,Winter,1903
agreed,1,True,3,germany,turkey,2,131,Winter,1903
so this time i tried going into various strategies in why moving against austria isnt as hard as he thinks it is but hes acting not convinced anyway i think there may be a path where we convince him to move together against austria but its not clear how to trust italy after all that hes done before and how closely allied hes been to austria,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,132,Winter,1903
i agree i would wait for some secondary evidence from england or me before trusting him to turn on austria,1,False,3,germany,turkey,2,133,Winter,1903
it is unfortunate but i do not have winning moves remaining,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,134,Spring,1904
this is unfortunate if that‚Äôs true,1,True,3,germany,turkey,2,135,Spring,1904
i mean it‚Äôs depends on when we can turn on austria,1,True,3,germany,turkey,2,136,Spring,1904
yes thats true however if they play it right as things stand then there is no way for me to push forward without me losing something basically without that 5th army the status quo is again slightly in their favor probably i will lose a unit every year ish if not faster by the time i only have a few left,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,137,Spring,1904
perhaps together with england i can hold the status quo but well see how that goes,1,,-3,turkey,germany,2,138,Spring,1904
could you attack ukr with war i suspect it will support sev so it can hold against my supported attack,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,139,Fall,1904
no i already agreed to support moscow with that unit  and he is supporting you into sev i don‚Äôt want to turn on austria until the spring,1,True,3,germany,turkey,2,140,Fall,1904
hm thats another course of action he has huh but hes not greedy so im not sure hed do that,1,False,-3,turkey,germany,2,141,Fall,1904
england told me he was gonna support you into sev,1,True,3,germany,turkey,2,142,Fall,1904
i believe him but its not enough if austria plays defensively and supports sev from ukr and rom,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,143,Fall,1904
then if i do go on the offensive its very likely i lose something in my mainland,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,144,Fall,1904
so gambling on austria being greedy is the wrong move imo,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,145,Fall,1904
unless i can guarantee that i capture sev,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,146,Fall,1904
hmm it‚Äôs your call i would love to prevent austria from getting another build,1,True,3,germany,turkey,2,147,Fall,1904
right is that possible,1,True,3,germany,turkey,2,148,Fall,1904
only if you cut his support support unfortunately,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,149,Fall,1904
and do what,1,,3,germany,turkey,2,150,Fall,1904
but if you attack ukr with warsaw youd also cut austrias support on a possible att on mosocow,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,151,Fall,1904
so basically its two birds with one stone,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,152,Fall,1904
i can get into sev and you prevent a possible attack on moscow,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,153,Fall,1904
i made a commitment to england already so you have to convince him,1,True,3,germany,turkey,2,154,Fall,1904
ill try and message him,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,155,Fall,1904
look its very likely that a gal  war to cut your support if he makes an aggressive move,1,,-3,turkey,germany,2,156,Fall,1904
then the only thing saving moscow is if i attack sev,1,,-3,turkey,germany,2,157,Fall,1904
see httpswwwbackstabbrcomsandbox63408948091289601904fall,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,158,Fall,1904
if i dont attack sev here moscow would fall,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,159,Fall,1904
hmmm,1,True,3,germany,turkey,2,160,Fall,1904
i don‚Äôt see what i can do to shift the equation,1,True,3,germany,turkey,2,161,Fall,1904
actually youre right,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,2,162,Fall,1904
i may hit ukraine to allow you to retake sev,1,True,3,germany,turkey,2,163,Fall,1904
sure lets give it a try,1,True,-6,turkey,germany,2,164,Winter,1904
so are you going to move on ukr in spring,1,True,-6,turkey,germany,2,165,Winter,1904
no me and england we thinking about jumping the gun in a last ditch effort to save sev,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,166,Spring,1905
but this turn i think if i have the balls to do it i‚Äôm going to just dive into austria,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,167,Spring,1905
and lets the chips fall where they may,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,168,Spring,1905
great im still coming up with their likely game plan id like to not lose 2 centers in turkey by winter if i can prevent it,1,True,-6,turkey,germany,2,169,Spring,1905
what is your plan surrounding ukr and gal,1,True,-6,turkey,germany,2,170,Spring,1905
no idea i literally haven‚Äôt thought this thru,1,False,6,germany,turkey,2,171,Spring,1905
i‚Äôm hoping you and england can come up with a good strategy here,1,False,6,germany,turkey,2,172,Spring,1905
i will get support from england to attack sev if you do a war ukr that will succeed and one of austrias armies there will be disbanded,1,,-6,turkey,germany,2,173,Spring,1905
that‚Äôs great news,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,174,Spring,1905
so youre ready to help,1,True,-6,turkey,germany,2,175,Spring,1905
yes let me set my orders,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,176,Spring,1905
i will help you retake sev but i cannot hit ukraine until the fall i have to sure up my hold in warsaw and my path into vienna i hope that is acceptable,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,177,Spring,1905
yo,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,178,Spring,1905
ack,1,True,-6,turkey,germany,2,179,Spring,1905
did you request england to not support my attack,1,False,-6,turkey,germany,2,180,Fall,1905
i asked him to support warsaw with the understanding that we will both support you into sev this turn,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,181,Fall,1905
i couldn‚Äôt help you in the spring because i risked losing warsaw which would set the whole war on austria behind,1,False,6,germany,turkey,2,182,Fall,1905
i wouldve been happy to attack rum or similar in this turn which would make it much harder for austria to hold warsaw or vienna at the same time even if you had lost warsaw in spring theres no way austria couldve held warsaw with you getting some support from england attack of 3 strenght,1,True,-6,turkey,germany,2,183,Fall,1905
that could be right idk but let‚Äôs focus on helping you take sev this turn,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,184,Fall,1905
hey turkey  one of my big goals is to make sure you get another build in 1906 i think most likely this will be doable in rum,1,False,6,germany,turkey,2,185,Fall,1905
i have to ask you something tho,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,186,Fall,1905
sure what is it,1,True,-6,turkey,germany,2,187,Fall,1905
just keep me posted if you hear any wind that people are going to gang up on me now that i have 10 units and they all have 7 i‚Äôm a bit worried,1,True,8,germany,turkey,2,188,Winter,1905
i‚Äôm thinking king we may be able to have you take rum this year,1,True,8,germany,turkey,2,189,Winter,1905
yeah im also considering bul but i need to defend ank as well,1,True,-8,turkey,germany,2,190,Spring,1906
when did you want to move on rum,1,True,-8,turkey,germany,2,191,Spring,1906
maybe fall,1,False,8,germany,turkey,2,192,Spring,1906
what are the plans in fall,1,True,-8,turkey,germany,2,193,Fall,1906
can you support my unit in war into ukraine i will use him to support you into rom,1,True,7,germany,turkey,2,194,Spring,1907
congrats on the big retake,1,True,7,germany,turkey,2,195,Spring,1907
i feel like i turned on austria just in time to save you haha,1,True,7,germany,turkey,2,196,Spring,1907
hi sorry for the tardyness ive just had a really busy weekend üôÇ,1,True,-7,turkey,germany,2,197,Spring,1907
yeah thanks slowly getting back into the game,1,True,-7,turkey,germany,2,198,Spring,1907
no worries would you feel comfortable supporting me into rom then in the spring i‚Äôll move to budapest and you can take rom,1,True,7,germany,turkey,2,199,Fall,1907
i think it makes slightly more sense for me to take it this turn because you won‚Äôt have the physical spaces to build two new units,1,False,7,germany,turkey,2,200,Fall,1907
while im not entirely opposed to this proposition i dont have time to fully consider it today nor tomorrow i will just stay as i am for now,1,True,-7,turkey,germany,2,201,Fall,1907
can you support me into rom,1,True,7,germany,turkey,2,202,Fall,1907
or are you working with austria,1,True,7,germany,turkey,2,203,Fall,1907
im not working with austria im just not doing anything,1,False,-7,turkey,germany,2,204,Fall,1907
down to support you into rom,1,,6,germany,turkey,2,205,Spring,1908
i‚Äôm going to hit rom unless you want it,1,,6,germany,turkey,2,206,Spring,1908
what‚Äôs good man  hoping to chat before adjudication,1,,6,germany,turkey,2,207,Spring,1908

i‚Äôm going to push into bud in the fall with your support from rum and my support from vienna,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,223,Spring,1908
but it will be easier once you‚Äôre in rum,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,224,Spring,1908

y,1,True,6,germany,turkey,2,282,Fall,1909
we should bounce in bur this turn,1,False,0,france,germany,2,0,Spring,1901
hi france sorry for the delay  still getting the hang of this app why do you think we should bounce in bur,1,True,0,germany,france,2,1,Spring,1901
to start id like us to have a good relationship so im starting by telling you what im going to do which is move an army to burgundy ideally to bounce this allows me to protect in case you were planning on doing something to begin with second bouncing helps you out because germanys first move with the munich army is either to move to burgundy or the ruhr if you dont move to bur then im there and you have to move the ruhr army back to protect mun anyway i think we both have other issues than creating a relatively pointless stalemate here when there are better targets if we work together,1,True,0,france,germany,2,2,Spring,1901
interesting i will have to think it over what does it look like three years down the road if we‚Äôre working together,1,False,0,germany,france,2,3,Spring,1901
england destroyed and divided you in the north sweeping up russia with support ive swept down into italy,0,False,0,france,germany,2,4,Spring,1901
okay  this works for me i was going into rohr will adjust my order and bounce if we work together against england offers a lot of advantages for both of us especially in the early game,1,True,0,germany,france,2,5,Spring,1901
i‚Äôve set my order to mun  burg,1,True,0,germany,france,2,6,Spring,1901
i‚Äôd say russia is a bit of an issue for you but the player can‚Äôt be very good because moving the fleet to finland was literally useless and turkey is about to wreck his southern half,1,True,0,france,germany,2,7,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm not going to move against you and england is going to be an issue for both of us since they‚Äôll have 5 builds in 1902,1,True,0,france,germany,2,8,Fall,1901
agreed russia also is not very communicative,1,True,0,germany,france,2,9,Fall,1901
what‚Äôs your strategy regarding england,1,True,0,germany,france,2,10,Fall,1901
try to survive for now i guess was hoping russia wouldnt fall flat on their face in scandinavia ill consolidate and try and support you against an english attack in belgium after winter,1,True,0,france,germany,2,11,Fall,1901
russia tells me that we will hold in pru  not sure to believe him but i think it‚Äôs a little early to start screwing people,1,True,0,germany,france,2,12,Fall,1901
do you mind if i move into ruh to support a potential future attack on bel,1,True,0,germany,france,2,13,Fall,1901
yeah that should be fine,1,,0,france,germany,2,14,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm going to move mun to ber instead i don‚Äôt trust russia right now,1,,0,germany,france,2,15,Fall,1901
what‚Äôs your strategy with going after england will you take the channel shortly,1,,0,germany,france,2,16,Fall,1901

thoughts,1,True,1,austria,england,2,53,Spring,1904
interesting proposition my biggest concern is that i‚Äôve left myself open to germany in the north grabbing warsaw would ensure that i lose norway and he has a clear path to my island,1,True,-1,england,austria,2,54,Fall,1904
germany trusts you after that support into paris  now is the time to move and take advantage of that  i can support you into warsaw if you need,1,True,1,austria,england,2,55,Fall,1904
right now im just planning to defend sev i have no plans to open up additional fronts against you i have enough enemies as is,1,True,1,austria,england,2,56,Fall,1904

well actions will speak here let‚Äôs see how things shake out this year,1,True,-1,england,austria,2,58,Fall,1904
i need to be sure that youre not supporting turkey against me here or ill just take moscow  theres too much on the line for us to just wait this out,1,True,1,austria,england,2,59,Fall,1904
it‚Äôs hard to build trust in this game quickly i understand the urgency though,1,True,-1,england,austria,2,60,Fall,1904
thanks,1,True,1,austria,england,2,61,Fall,1904
i would really appreciate affirmation about your not helping turkey back in,1,True,1,austria,england,2,62,Fall,1904
i can‚Äôt flip on germany until we have a more established relationship if we want to build that we need to take small leaps of faith i will not support turkey please do not take moscow if that goes we can start planning more seriously against germany,0,True,-1,england,austria,2,63,Fall,1904
that works for me  thanks for checking in,1,True,1,austria,england,2,64,Fall,1904
thank you,1,True,2,austria,england,2,65,Winter,1904
did you ask germany to take the north sea,1,True,2,austria,england,2,66,Winter,1904
hey if germany invaded you without your permission im all in with you,1,False,2,austria,england,2,67,Winter,1904

can we talk about germany for a sec,1,True,2,austria,england,2,69,Spring,1905
yes im sorry ive been ignoring you,1,True,-2,england,austria,2,70,Spring,1905
hahaha i get worried sometimes,1,True,2,austria,england,2,71,Spring,1905
ive been trying to talk to him but things seem to be breaking down,1,True,-2,england,austria,2,72,Spring,1905
what do you have in mind,1,True,-2,england,austria,2,73,Spring,1905
how so,1,True,2,austria,england,2,74,Spring,1905
the dude needs to be taken out for any of us to have a chance  he has the most scs on the board and potential to take more from you whcih i dont want to see,1,True,2,austria,england,2,75,Spring,1905
neither do i but im not sure what we can coordinate together,1,True,-2,england,austria,2,76,Spring,1905
lets talk about warsaw,1,True,2,austria,england,2,77,Spring,1905
what you thinking,1,True,-2,england,austria,2,78,Spring,1905
one of us has to move into it by the end of the year germany is building to move against me turkey is still a pain in the butt and italy is getting testy  i need your help to crack this dude and i cant be running damage control for the board on my own,1,True,2,austria,england,2,79,Spring,1905

we really shouldnt wait  ive watched him amass power and move into every sector of the board without resistance,1,True,2,austria,england,2,81,Spring,1905
what do you want to wait for,1,True,2,austria,england,2,82,Spring,1905
just curious,1,True,2,austria,england,2,83,Spring,1905
i want to see how he moves before i full on stab him,1,True,-2,england,austria,2,84,Spring,1905
lets imagine if he moves into edinburgh and towards norwayat that point its too late to respond,1,True,2,austria,england,2,85,Spring,1905
berlin will be in prussia by that time holding warsaw against any of our attacks and threatening your single unit covering both moscow and st petersburg,1,True,2,austria,england,2,86,Spring,1905
thats a two center pickup at that point and no one can stop him  this move could determine the game  i dont want to see us sleeping on the next three movesets,1,True,2,austria,england,2,87,Spring,1905
thoughts  i know this is a lot to process but ive seen a lot of diplomacy games and ive had some go south on its participants very quickly,1,True,2,austria,england,2,88,Spring,1905
and i really want to finalize my moveset before midnight,1,True,2,austria,england,2,89,Spring,1905

i need to sleep soon,1,,2,austria,england,2,100,Spring,1905
you ask for a pause,1,,2,austria,england,2,101,Spring,1905
trying to decide if its worth staying up for,1,,2,austria,england,2,102,Spring,1905
any final thoughts,1,,2,austria,england,2,103,Spring,1905
i submitted,1,True,-2,england,austria,2,104,Spring,1905
what should i expect,1,True,2,austria,england,2,105,Spring,1905
you want support into warsaw,1,True,2,austria,england,2,106,Spring,1905
i‚Äôm supporting you,0,False,-2,england,austria,2,107,Spring,1905

yeah i said that you lied on the last message lol,1,True,2,austria,england,2,110,Spring,1905
lol,1,True,-2,england,austria,2,111,Spring,1905
not a bad turn for us i guess,1,True,2,austria,england,2,112,Spring,1905
could have gone a lot worse,1,True,2,austria,england,2,113,Spring,1905
glad that i at least got him to mess up your convoy lol,1,False,2,austria,england,2,114,Spring,1905
small wins,1,True,2,austria,england,2,115,Spring,1905
what‚Äôs the plan now,1,True,0,england,austria,2,116,Fall,1906
you seem pretty well entrenched,1,True,0,austria,england,2,117,Fall,1906
that‚Äôs a fair observation,1,True,0,england,austria,2,118,Fall,1906
is there any point in talking we know what the other wants and those wants are at odds  its going to be a ns stalemate line for the rest of the game unless italy or turkey screws up,1,True,0,austria,england,2,119,Fall,1906
what do you think i want,1,True,0,england,austria,2,120,Fall,1906
if you didnt want to take advantage of g earlier you missed your chance  the fronts will just solidify from now on,1,True,0,austria,england,2,121,Fall,1906
so what do you think i want then,1,True,0,england,austria,2,122,Fall,1906
hopefully you want to draw this out at this point  unless italy fucks up thats what should be happening,1,True,0,austria,england,2,123,Fall,1906
a kinda sad end to what was a good start,1,True,0,austria,england,2,124,Fall,1906
interesting not sure that‚Äôs what i want,1,True,0,england,austria,2,125,Fall,1906
why dont you tell me then,1,True,0,austria,england,2,126,Fall,1906
well of course as anyone i‚Äôd like to solo but i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs in the cards i‚Äôd like to see things shake up once the battle lines are drawn not sure if we‚Äôre there yet though,1,True,0,england,austria,2,127,Fall,1906
that mostly comes from germany in the east,1,True,0,austria,england,2,128,Fall,1906
as far as tyr and marseilles go,1,True,0,austria,england,2,129,Fall,1906

lol,1,True,2,england,austria,2,133,Spring,1907
hey turkey how are you doing looking forward to working with you this game,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,0,Spring,1901
you there would love to talk strategy at some point,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,1,Spring,1901
hey austria yeah im around,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,2,Spring,1901
good to hear from you hows your night,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,3,Spring,1901
im kind of getting the grips on this game,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,4,Spring,1901
no worries are you friend of admin,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,5,Spring,1901
yep get dragged into a lotta things must say this is kind of out there,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,6,Spring,1901
anyway russia is kind of scary they start with 4 units,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,7,Spring,1901
you play diplomacy before,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,8,Spring,1901
yeah they are  id love to take him out asap honestly,1,False,0,austria,turkey,2,9,Spring,1901
im not sure i can do that much but im happy to help,0,True,0,turkey,austria,2,10,Spring,1901
if you trust me i can coach us both through advantageously,1,False,0,austria,turkey,2,11,Spring,1901
you dont know who i am but i was the 1 player on the diplomacy app conspiracy and i run the largest only diplomacy tournament in the world so i can coach us both through to a pretty good result,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,12,Spring,1901
ah thats cool yeah im afraid im gonna get stuck in a snag somewhere,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,13,Spring,1901
in general i was hoping to at least take the black sea and kind of capture the supply center in bulgaria,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,14,Spring,1901
im not so sure about what to do beyond that,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,15,Spring,1901
those are both good starts  i suggest sending that second unit to armenia,1,False,0,austria,turkey,2,16,Spring,1901
it will make the attack on russia far more effective in the future,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,17,Spring,1901
like setting up a move sequence in chess,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,18,Spring,1901
i read that sending the smy to constantinople was good,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,19,Spring,1901
yeah thats a typical move too,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,20,Spring,1901
the arm sequence indicates a hard commit against russia which is why its not quite as often used but im hard commiting against russia so i would love for you to do the same,1,False,0,austria,turkey,2,21,Spring,1901
im happy to support you if i can get sevastopol,0,True,0,turkey,austria,2,22,Spring,1901
thats the hope,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,23,Spring,1901
how would the army to armenia play out i suppose the fleet in sevastopol either goes to black sea or rumania probably black sea do you plan to go to rumania first,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,24,Spring,1901
i wasnt planning to go to rum first should i,1,False,0,austria,turkey,2,25,Spring,1901
alright will you be able to provide support to attack sevastopol,0,True,0,turkey,austria,2,26,Fall,1901
can i do it in the next spring im not adjacent to sev here,1,False,0,austria,turkey,2,27,Fall,1901
i could go to rum for some more support to assault sevastopol,0,True,0,turkey,austria,2,28,Fall,1901
you could  i suggest it,1,,0,austria,turkey,2,29,Fall,1901
that went pretty well,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,30,Winter,1901
lol amazing,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,31,Winter,1901
good work,1,,0,austria,turkey,2,32,Winter,1901
glad to see russia down a peg here,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,33,Winter,1901
nothing whats the plan here unfortunate for the two of us that russia left that fleet in the black sea ,0,False,0,austria,turkey,2,34,Spring,1902
yeah im not sure what his play is russia seems very inconsistent,1,False,0,turkey,austria,2,35,Spring,1902
i think ill need a few turns before i could move north to attack russia though what is a good plan from here,0,False,0,turkey,austria,2,36,Spring,1902
looks like youre pretty committed north already the fleet builds sold it,1,,0,austria,turkey,2,37,Spring,1902
youre in a good spot  you should take the black sea here that will give you a ton of leverage in the future,0,,0,austria,turkey,2,38,Spring,1902
so are we just coordinating anymore you might as well just tell me you want to attack me,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,39,Spring,1902
hi im actually away from home so i havent been paying too close attention yet,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,40,Spring,1902
yeah ill take care of that fleet in bla then with 1 support it should be easy to move on to mos,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,41,Spring,1902
looks like we were always at war with eurasia after all,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,42,Fall,1902
seems as if  whats the plan,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,43,Fall,1902
poor russia,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,44,Fall,1902
i feel bad but i ended up going to sleep before i got a response from you so i figured you were out to attack me,0,False,0,austria,turkey,2,45,Fall,1902
very poor russia  the worst possible start,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,46,Fall,1902
you squeezed him too hard and now hes dead üò¶,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,47,Fall,1902
i didnt squeeze him haha,1,False,0,austria,turkey,2,48,Fall,1902
but yeah we had a good mutual effort there,1,False,0,austria,turkey,2,49,Fall,1902
mutual as in he got his stuff destroyed while he got walked over huh,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,50,Fall,1902
i mean hes partially to blame of course,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,51,Fall,1902
anyway i dont think im doing too badly for my first gae,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,52,Fall,1902
i havent attacked you so far either nor have i had the opportunity to,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,53,Fall,1902
besides claiming centers that are close to me,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,54,Fall,1902
youre not doing badly,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,55,Fall,1902
just need to keep that momentum going,1,True,0,austria,turkey,2,56,Fall,1902
eh im good with what i havehad,1,True,0,turkey,austria,2,57,Fall,1902
an attack of strength 3 4 for when you really really really really want that region üò≠,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,2,58,Fall,1903
yeah,1,True,1,austria,turkey,2,59,Fall,1903
italy is such a pain in my ass,0,True,1,austria,turkey,2,60,Fall,1903
i must say i agree,1,True,-3,turkey,austria,2,61,Winter,1903
you online,1,True,3,austria,turkey,2,62,Fall,1904
yep,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,63,Winter,1904
its going poorly for me but im a rational player so if you wanna suggest something go ahead,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,64,Winter,1904
im thinking its tough because id rather keep it clean than overtly lie to you im not that type of player honestly youre in a tough spot,1,False,5,austria,turkey,2,65,Winter,1904
sure am,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,66,Winter,1904
you request the pause,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,67,Spring,1905
so believe it or not i may actually have to work with you if i dont want e or g to win,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,68,Fall,1905
i believe you because i can see that happening too,1,,-5,turkey,austria,2,69,Fall,1905
so plan out a fair strategy  wouldnt be surprised if you were mad but im willing to put some of that shit behind for the good of the game and the players on the losing end of it,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,70,Fall,1905
alright but heres the thing 23 of turkey is occupied by you and italy so the payment would come out of your own pocket,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,71,Fall,1905
like im willing to look beyond there and consider maybe russia or italy,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,72,Fall,1905
im willing to sacrifice a little but not much  im the main line of defense against germany rn,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,73,Fall,1905
at least youre semi reasonable about it  many arent,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,74,Fall,1905
i also dont want germany to win and i can see that youre being pressured,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,75,Fall,1905
if you were to fall to germany completely that would be bad for me too,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,76,Fall,1905
right,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,77,Fall,1905
my guess is theyre looking to draw it out at this point unless someone has a 1909 stab,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,78,Fall,1905
englad is getting some reinforcements to stp now,1,,-5,turkey,austria,2,79,Fall,1905
yeah i see  we need to move this turn,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,80,Fall,1905
honestly i should have reached out last turn but i thought i had a good guess left in me,1,False,5,austria,turkey,2,81,Fall,1905
i think if we can come to a nonagression accross the turkey straits that would be beneficial for both of us,1,,-5,turkey,austria,2,82,Fall,1905
you can use the armies stationed there now for your defense while i rebuild and attempt to go north,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,83,Fall,1905
thats fine,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,84,Fall,1905
if you are okay with that then i will take con build an army in ank and then take smy,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,85,Spring,1906
you dont need con and amy right now  this only works if we give up what we have to  i can give you con but your units wont have anywhere to go after that esp if we cant break you out of sev here,1,False,5,austria,turkey,2,86,Spring,1906
is this about moscow i dont have a way to hold onto that yet,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,87,Spring,1906
yeah but we have to move fast esp as that english reinforcement is coming soon,1,False,5,austria,turkey,2,88,Spring,1906
as they lock down we need to move fast and keep them guessing,1,False,5,austria,turkey,2,89,Spring,1906
if i would be able to take moscow with you support then in fall i would be surrounded by three angry armies,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,90,Spring,1906
is there a step two to this plan,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,91,Spring,1906
frankly im not sure we get far anyway but we dont get anywhere if moscow is supported by stp next turn,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,92,Spring,1906
i can see what youre saying but i am not afforded the luxury of a gamble at this point in the game,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,93,Spring,1906
youre not but you wont later either  you can still hold moscow with your fleet plus my army and worst comes to worst your army would be loose behind their front  the alternative is we continue to attack you and we all lost out  italy me you,1,False,5,austria,turkey,2,94,Spring,1906
i dont want to play that game,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,95,Spring,1906
i think the only way i can hold moscow is if you move a rum  sev while i go to moscow then next turn we can hold it,1,,-5,turkey,austria,2,96,Spring,1906
for you to hold rum then youd retreat a con  bul simultaneously,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,97,Spring,1906
of course my fleet cannot support my army in moscow,1,True,-5,turkey,austria,2,98,Spring,1906
why not genuinely curous,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,99,Spring,1906
oh never,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,100,Spring,1906
i misread your statement,1,True,5,austria,turkey,2,101,Spring,1906

you ask for the pause good work on holding off the atlantic so far youve been in a tough spot,1,True,6,austria,france,2,20,Spring,1905
hello russia have you worked out what you‚Äôre doing with turkey and austria yet i‚Äôm thinking of going anti germany but want to see how we align in the north first,0,,-1,england,russia,2,0,Spring,1901
i sent turkey a message but still waiting on a reply i wanted to go antigermany too if you want to split the population centers but if i don‚Äôt hear back from turkey i may have to fortify my south flank and enter the balkan‚Äôs even though i don‚Äôt want to,1,,1,russia,england,2,1,Spring,1901
i moving to pressuregermany but i could use assistance on your end willing to share any gains that could result,1,True,1,russia,england,2,2,Spring,1901
yikes you have some turkish trouble i‚Äôll plan on moving into helgoland bight,1,,-1,england,russia,2,3,Fall,1901
yea that‚Äôs always annoying playing as russia trying to get ah to help out but i have to move one of my troops back west away from pressuring germany oh well,1,True,1,russia,england,2,4,Fall,1901
that‚Äôs a shame let‚Äôs reassess after you handle your problems in the east,1,,-1,england,russia,2,5,Fall,1901
hey man let me know if you wanna support my fleet moving to sweden would pressure germany and keep me aive with a new supply center in my fight in the sky th with turkey i‚Äôm gonna need all the help i can get there but have ah help to keep me alive down there,1,True,-2,russia,england,2,6,Spring,1902
yes turkey has been a real thorn in your side i‚Äôd like to see some pressure on germany to ease off my unit in belgium if i support you into sweden will you support me into denmark,1,True,2,england,russia,2,7,Spring,1902
definitely,1,,-2,russia,england,2,8,Spring,1902
hi russia it seems we are pitted against some dangerous opponents this time,1,,-1,turkey,russia,2,0,Spring,1901
i do plan to f ank bla if you wish you may wish to f sev  bla as well,1,,-1,turkey,russia,2,1,Spring,1901
hi russia i think we should come to some mutual understanding here or things will turn out bad for the both of us,1,False,2,turkey,russia,2,2,Winter,1901
look  i know i took sev but i will not be able to take moscov and its honestly a waste of time for the both of us id rather focus on austria  italy,1,False,2,turkey,russia,2,3,Winter,1901
if you decommision the fleet in bla i will attempt to move out of sev,1,,2,turkey,russia,2,4,Winter,1901
and go to rumania,1,,2,turkey,russia,2,5,Winter,1901
i was going to decommission the army in prussia you can just move the army to romania and i‚Äôll return the fleet to sev i‚Äôm willing to help you switch your focus to ah and italy and even help you eventually but we need to build the trust before i decommission the fleet in black sea i think,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,2,6,Winter,1901
honestly the smarter move would have been for us to work together from the beginning but there‚Äôs a lot of innate distrust built in to the game between russia and turkey haha,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,2,7,Winter,1901
turkey and russia are great allies the rough part is the fleet in bla if we can get past that things could much better for both of us,1,,2,turkey,russia,2,8,Winter,1901
as far as i can see the fleet in bla does not serve you a strategic purpose since i cannot afford to move more units north without giving up my flank to austria,1,,2,turkey,russia,2,9,Winter,1901
and of course i cannot take moscow with just 1 army,1,,2,turkey,russia,2,10,Winter,1901
i do expect my sev army to get bounced at least in spring though but with the fleet in bla i can f bla s a sev  rum,1,True,2,turkey,russia,2,11,Winter,1901
ok that makes sense the black sea sucks,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,2,12,Winter,1901
feel free to a war  mos just in case however i would appreciate having an alliance in the future do you think theres a possibilty for you attack budapest i could support you from rum,1,,2,turkey,russia,2,13,Winter,1901
then in turn i can get serbia,1,,2,turkey,russia,2,14,Winter,1901
i am sad to see you changed your mind,1,,2,turkey,russia,2,15,Spring,1902
doesn‚Äôt really matter anymore i‚Äôm done,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,2,16,Fall,1902
wished it couldve turned out differently i honestly was willing to work with you last year,1,True,2,turkey,russia,2,17,Fall,1902
yea honestly i screwed up from the beginning we should have teamed up from the beginning was my first t8me as russia and i failed spectacularly haha,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,2,18,Fall,1902
i think yeah 1901 went extremely poorly for you but i think i had a decent plan for your recover at least not sure if couldve won but at least restored to 4 cp and then push into austria,1,True,2,turkey,russia,2,19,Fall,1902
i basically ignored you and pushed east to germany right away terrible strategy as russia,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,2,20,Fall,1902
i mean you couldve grabbed berlin but decied to hold in pru that confused me greatly at the same time germany and england were conspiring against you with northern openings,1,True,2,turkey,russia,2,21,Fall,1902
england was talking to me about going after germanyi know now that was bs anyway i shouldn‚Äôt have gone after germany right away anyway,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,2,22,Fall,1902
yeah retrospect is easy  im expecting a gal war at least im not going to move a sev  rum so perhaps you can block austria from getting too far ahead,1,True,2,turkey,russia,2,23,Fall,1902
unless you wish to exit the game quickly then a mos  ukr would be appreciated üòÉ,1,True,2,turkey,russia,2,24,Fall,1902
open,1,,-1,france,russia,2,0,Spring,1901
hey russia just keeping lines ope,1,,-1,france,russia,2,1,Spring,1901
austria and italy are allying fyi,1,,-1,france,russia,2,2,Spring,1901
ok thanks i told italy t9 go after ah haha they kind of have to as the 2 weakest starting countries really or 1 screws the other i think i‚Äôm safe early on but turkey might have some problems,1,True,1,russia,france,2,3,Spring,1901
hi england ive been kinda occupied with russia  italy so far but it seems things may be becoming relevant to us it seems likely to me that a war will move to mos to support taking back sev,1,True,0,turkey,england,2,0,Spring,1902
hi england nice capture of stp there i think were trying to figure something out against the austria  italy alliance,1,,0,turkey,england,2,1,Winter,1902
if you can move the army in nwy over would you want to split moscow and  warsaw i get moscow you warsaw,1,,0,turkey,england,2,2,Winter,1902
hey england can we come to a deal about moscow,1,True,0,turkey,england,2,3,Fall,1903
good question a bounce there would be silly what do have in mind,1,True,0,england,turkey,2,4,Fall,1903
im okay with you taking moscov for now but would really like some support in holding sev,1,True,0,turkey,england,2,5,Fall,1903
that sounds like a good deal to me,1,True,0,england,turkey,2,6,Fall,1903
support me in,1,True,0,england,turkey,2,7,Fall,1903
sure but theres a good chance of a rum  sev so dont count on it,1,True,0,turkey,england,2,8,Fall,1903
let‚Äôs see what happens,1,True,0,england,turkey,2,9,Fall,1903
it would probably be best if you move a mos  sev and bump with austrias army there,1,True,-2,turkey,england,2,10,Spring,1904
unless you need to support germany on warsaw,1,True,-2,turkey,england,2,11,Spring,1904
i should have talked to you in time,1,True,2,england,turkey,2,12,Spring,1904
i was supporting you in,1,True,2,england,turkey,2,13,Spring,1904
want me to support you into sev,1,True,2,england,turkey,2,14,Fall,1904
yes please,1,True,-2,turkey,england,2,15,Fall,1904
this is bit uncomfortable though because its likely ill lose something in the south because of it,1,True,-2,turkey,england,2,16,Fall,1904
are you still around,1,True,-2,turkey,england,2,17,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm supporting you in,1,False,2,england,turkey,2,18,Fall,1904
can you please confirm that you will be moving armenia to sev supported by black sea i need to knock austria out of there so he doesn‚Äôt break into the north,1,True,2,england,turkey,2,19,Fall,1904
this only has a point if germany helps out too otherwise he could have a defense strength of 3,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,20,Winter,1904
i had it all set up but didn‚Äôt hear back from you so we didn‚Äôt go ahead with it,0,True,3,england,turkey,2,21,Winter,1904
supporting is always better than holding üòÉ except for diplomatic reasons,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,22,Winter,1904
so lets give it a try this time ok,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,23,Winter,1904
i think germany is also willing to help,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,24,Winter,1904
so are you ready to force sev now,1,True,3,england,turkey,2,25,Spring,1905
are you still on,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,26,Spring,1905
yes,1,True,3,england,turkey,2,27,Spring,1905
germany is on board,1,True,3,england,turkey,2,28,Spring,1905
im trying to figure out whats gonna happen to turkey while im away,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,29,Spring,1905
you are turkey,1,True,3,england,turkey,2,30,Spring,1905
what do you mean,1,True,3,england,turkey,2,31,Spring,1905
are you ready,1,True,3,england,turkey,2,32,Spring,1905
im talking about the four units ready to invade my homeland,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,33,Spring,1905
well im interested in seeing you survive as long as possible,1,True,3,england,turkey,2,34,Spring,1905
like its a gamble either way,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,35,Spring,1905
if i go to sev i will lose 2 terrotories in turkey,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,36,Spring,1905
sev can be forced if i suport and germany taps ukraine,1,,3,england,turkey,2,37,Spring,1905
so would you rather cover smyrna,1,True,3,england,turkey,2,38,Spring,1905
im considering going to sev in fall so that i trade 1 territory for 1,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,39,Spring,1905
do we believe italy and austria to be big buddies still,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,40,Spring,1905
theyre very buddy buddy,1,True,3,england,turkey,2,41,Spring,1905
ok then i go for sev now,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,42,Spring,1905
you will support a arm  sev,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,43,Spring,1905
yes,1,True,3,england,turkey,2,44,Spring,1905
talk to germany,1,True,3,england,turkey,2,45,Spring,1905
let‚Äôs try it again you have to talk to germany,1,False,3,england,turkey,2,46,Fall,1905
look its in your interest to get austria out of there asap too because he could send you packing at any time with a supported attack from ukraine,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,47,Fall,1905
plus you wouldnt want germany to win against austria too easily either,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,48,Fall,1905
but it looks like germany now approves this attack,1,True,-3,turkey,england,2,49,Fall,1905
great supporting you in,1,True,3,england,turkey,2,50,Fall,1905
alright so whats your general plan here if germany stomps austria we need to be prepared first thing he will probably move his fleets into edi,1,True,-5,turkey,england,2,51,Spring,1906
i‚Äôve been trying to think about the stab i‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs the right time now,1,,5,england,turkey,2,52,Spring,1906
i think austria can crumble really quickly after that we need to come up with some plan like im happy to try to push into the balkans that should tie down a few troops but im probably still outnumbered,1,True,-4,turkey,england,2,53,Spring,1908
what do you suggest,1,True,4,england,turkey,2,54,Spring,1908
when germany pushes into austria but before winter when g gets to build more troops his northern flank is quite empty specificallly you may be able to take warsaw,1,True,-4,turkey,england,2,55,Spring,1908
and denmark,1,True,-4,turkey,england,2,56,Spring,1908
and how are you going to help this cause,1,True,4,england,turkey,2,57,Fall,1908
i agree that he cant get too big,1,True,4,england,turkey,2,58,Fall,1908
so were gonna go and work on austria who has gotten really angry over things but besides that that means me and germany will get a few more troops so either you need to make your move before that happens or have a plan for afterwards,1,True,-4,turkey,england,2,59,Fall,1908
lets move now,1,True,2,england,turkey,2,60,Spring,1909
hi whats the plan,1,True,-2,turkey,england,2,61,Spring,1909
not sure you need to move into sev,1,True,2,england,turkey,2,62,Spring,1909
i can do that yeah,1,True,-2,turkey,england,2,63,Spring,1909
but im not sure how to help with that further,1,True,-2,turkey,england,2,64,Spring,1909
i‚Äôm supporting rum to ukr,1,True,2,england,turkey,2,65,Fall,1909

sounds good,0,True,0,france,england,2,1,Spring,1901
that went well we can keep the dmz in the channel it looks like its working well for both of us and germany might have some problems coming up,1,True,0,france,england,2,2,Fall,1901

any chance you‚Äôd support me into spain,1,,6,england,france,2,9,Fall,1906
i can offer keeping you in the game so you make the draw,0,,6,england,france,2,10,Fall,1906
hi france im a little bit nervous about an austrianitalian alliance would you mind mutually sharing information on their intentions,1,True,0,turkey,france,2,0,Spring,1901
sure although all austria has done is complain about their country so far lol,1,True,0,france,turkey,2,1,Spring,1901
austria seems very knowledgeable so i would take whatever is said with a grain of salt,1,False,0,turkey,france,2,2,Spring,1901
austria and italy seem to have made a peacefire for the start of the game at least,1,,0,turkey,france,2,3,Spring,1901
have you talked to england or germany,1,False,0,turkey,france,2,4,Spring,1901
yeah fairlystandard stuff given that we all pretty much have to attack each other at some point,1,True,0,france,turkey,2,5,Spring,1901
i think i may be able to come to an agreement with italy to focus on austria for the moment would you be willing ceasefire with italy and leave pie empty this would leave you able to move north,1,,0,turkey,france,2,6,Winter,1901
did italy contact you,1,,0,turkey,france,2,7,Winter,1901
if they did not theyre likely still allied with austria and will attack both you and me,1,,0,turkey,france,2,8,Winter,1901
he contacted me,0,True,0,france,turkey,2,9,Spring,1902
toassure me that moving to piedmont isn‚Äôt an act of war which seems laughable but is manageable,0,True,0,france,turkey,2,10,Spring,1902
russia isn‚Äôt a threat at all to you though so that‚Äôs good,1,True,0,france,turkey,2,11,Spring,1902
im pretty sure austria  italy are going to do a lepanto to smy or syria,1,,0,turkey,france,2,12,Spring,1902
italy very badly didnt want me to build a fleet in smy,1,,0,turkey,france,2,13,Spring,1902
you don‚Äôt think austria is stabbing italy one move and he‚Äôs done,1,True,0,france,turkey,2,14,Spring,1902
if austria does then he wont be able to finish me off,1,,0,turkey,france,2,15,Spring,1902
so i think thats why he will wait until hes got the balkans and is ready to stab italy,1,,0,turkey,france,2,16,Spring,1902
look like italy may be refocusing west,1,True,0,turkey,france,2,17,Fall,1902
thats my read yeah,1,,0,france,turkey,2,18,Fall,1902
nope still tried to stab me,1,True,1,turkey,france,2,19,Winter,1902

have you made a decision in the west if you do decide you‚Äôre attacking france please let me know and i have a proposal to share with you,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,18,Fall,1901
it‚Äôs the funniest thing o queen in the north i‚Äôve been chatting with folk not a great deal else to do as italy at this point and one common theme keeps coming up russia offering them an alliance he‚Äôs offered one to me he‚Äôs offered one to turkey and to austria he‚Äôs offered one to england and i presume he‚Äôs offered one to you if i had to play the odds i‚Äôd guess he‚Äôs offered one to france as well but the president and i aren‚Äôt really on those friendly terms   can you confirm your part of this and what he‚Äôs trying to persuade you to in an alliance and if so what should we do about this it can be useful having a completely unscrupulous archtraitor around if we know who that is and don‚Äôt let them get so powerful that their opportunism backfired on us,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,19,Fall,1901
yes i have found the same to be true about russia but he hasnt responded to anything aside from the initial alliance offer so i am unsure of his plans,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,20,Fall,1901
so one of my friends online tells me i shouldnt out myself genderwise in the game that people will use it against me have you found that to be true or any particular bias from other players,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,21,Winter,1901
oh interesting i could see that being the case i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs caused problems for me or not honestly i find it interestingamusing to see how or if people react similar to my experience as a female engineer i notice that some people act surprised or change behavior which can potentially be annoying but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs put a target on my back necessarily have you noticed anything,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,22,Winter,1901
i wouldnt have thought so before today just like you say a bit of surprise sometimes a flash of interest from the especially thirsty and then we just move on as normal if its disadvantaged me ive never noticed it and i said as much to my friend at the time but then i found myself on the receiving end of   new message message ok lol ill check in with you in a couple days redacted dated fall 1901 do you think the sender is telling the truth,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,23,Winter,1901
im not precious and my thick skin is firmly back in place but other than offending me im not really sure what he was trying to achieve annoying me confusing me,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,24,Winter,1901
 wow yikes that‚Äôs really disappointing extra frustrating because if you respond at all you could solidify an enemy so it kind of ties your hands,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,25,Winter,1901
he did give me a few days i guess i figure ill give him a few more hours of icy silence and then move on,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,26,Winter,1901
anything new coming up diplomatically in the north the diplomatic channels have all gone quiet to italy but i think thats mostly people being busy over the weekend  im not terribly worried,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,27,Spring,1902
quiet here too üòÉ,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,28,Spring,1902
im strongly considering moving west against france a combination of france in spain south coast marseilles and a few disturbing rumours ive heard down the grapevine matched with having no idea what on earth is going on east of me   any chance you and england are considering a similar move,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,29,Spring,1902
it seems like england and i are both more focused on countries to our east at the moment i still cannot tell who russia is working with,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,30,Spring,1902
neither can we really okay then i still need to be nervous about what france is up to and whether it‚Äôs me,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,31,Spring,1902
i think you may be right if you still have  proposal for an attack against france let me know,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,32,Fall,1902
oh yes france just waltzed across the dmz line he agreed to so it looks like my nerves were spot on that leaves me much more keen to fight him  and ideally profit by it  than on plunging into the uncertainty east of me   we would welcome your support and given that france has exposed himself to your border i feel it would be decisive as well as lucrative,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,33,Fall,1902
so is that a yes friend queen there are rumors of a western triple but i think if we strike west okay mostly you could resolve the situation there while things are still resolving in the east,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,34,Fall,1902
queen sorry for the delay  i say yes but probably cant help much for another season or two i dont want to overcommit you should have unencumbered access to france this season though,1,False,1,germany,italy,3,35,Fall,1902
barring the entire french military lined up at my border of course ill see what i can do at least hes not getting any deeper into italy,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,36,Fall,1902
my friend why france still isn‚Äôt going to make any progress unless you open the door for him by attacking your two natural allies from munich and bohemia of course   still hoping this is part of a clever ruse on your part or that you‚Äôre headed for russia somehow   central alliance,1,True,1,italy,germany,3,37,Winter,1902
my fellow queen i can assure you my primary focus is russia i‚Äôm trying to work with austria against him and then hopefully we don‚Äôt have to worry as much about the east,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,38,Winter,1902
that is a relief to hear my fellow queen i‚Äôm hoping to begin pushing back against france in the new year and the army in tyrolia is fairly key to getting that process begun,1,,1,italy,germany,3,39,Winter,1902
england and i will be happy to help you as we can if you can work on swinging austria towards turkey,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,40,Spring,1903
england should be communicating as such too,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,41,Spring,1903
austria will help me kill turkey when im in a position to act against turkey myself im encouraging him to work with turkey in the interim to keep russia in check but until i can safely move away from france  safely not just with a season before he turns on me again  we cant afford an eastern war,1,True,1,italy,germany,3,42,Spring,1903
ok that makes sense let‚Äôs keep each other posted on the austriaturkeyrussia situation,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,43,Spring,1903
absolutely and if i can help you two silence mini napoleon i will,1,True,1,italy,germany,3,44,Spring,1903
hi fellow queen hope you had a nice weekend üòÉ,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,45,Spring,1904
do you have plans this season have you been able to coordinate with austria england and i are wondering what you‚Äôre thinking so we can all work together on figuring out what to do refrance,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,46,Spring,1904
austria seems more concerned with russiawarsaw at the moment not sure what you two have communicated about,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,47,Spring,1904
hi fellow queen yes it was good i had a wonderful and rare chance to spend a couple of days with my so so i appreciated the slow update time and wasnt as much online as usual  this season im mostly expecting to be fighting france im glad to see him rushing back to defend himself against you two but id be a poor friend if i left you to fight him on your own after youd come in to save me in the first place im hoping i can get some pressure on marseilles and im seeing if i can get around him into the mao maybe  what are your plans any way we can coordinate usefully  austria is mostly looking at the east although he did say he was glad to see we had england occupied with france so thats nice,1,,0,italy,germany,3,48,Spring,1904
what did you do with yours,1,,0,italy,germany,3,49,Spring,1904
hi sounds like a nice weekend mine was good too i went to a bachelorette party,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,50,Spring,1904
i am trying to set myself up to team up with austria against russia but not spread myself too thin eitheri am trying to decide if i should attempt to bounce with france again in bur but if he moves away from you into gas instead it leaves me surrounded,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,51,Spring,1904
i think the deciding factor is what and when we do about england hes potentially a very strong ally for either or both of us but only if hes prepared to fight against france and then northern russia only otherwise he makes it very hard for you and i to cooperate against an eastern enemy without keeping an eye to our west dont you think im hoping to move into france this turn but im unsure if ill be able to clear marseilles until fall,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,52,Spring,1904
sorry for the delayed response been busy with school stuff,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,53,Fall,1904
i hear that ive been sick and just trying to catch up on school things today hope the bachelorette party went well ive not actually been on one of those what sorts of things did you do,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,54,Fall,1904
at the moment i‚Äôve been able to cooperate well with england and he seems willing to help us out against france and russia so hopefully it will stay well balanced a little longer he‚Äôs apparently been busy as well so i‚Äôm not sure his plans yet at this point i don‚Äôt think either of us can count on france as an ally haha so i think it‚Äôs best to keep england on our good side for now,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,55,Fall,1904
oh no hope you feel better soon the party was fun we went out for dinner etc and stayed at a house in the mountains,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,56,Fall,1904
i agree and i think we can safely consider france as doomed im not saying england isnt sincere in that goal as well but im trying to look at next years problems or the year after that when france is down and were looking at what to do about turkey  or england as the case may be   probably if i sat on portugalspainmao i could quite comfortably work with england but that puts him into the position of going through you or northern russia since you havent tried to play me yet or youre doing so well i havent noticed yet lol i know who ill pick if im forced to  thanks yes im better now just headachey that sounds amazing and i love the overnight together with friends it sounds like so much fun and a chance to catch up with her tribe before she marries into a new one 3,1,,0,italy,germany,3,57,Fall,1904
yes i agree  i‚Äôm worried about england turning on me before france is sufficiently weakened i think the two of them are still on decent terms hard to tell with only these one on one conversations,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,58,Fall,1904
which is probably why its set up this way  can you tell me what happened with holland i asked england and he changed the subject was that agreed,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,59,Fall,1904
haha true,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,60,Fall,1904
honestly your guess is as good as mine hahah it was not agreed that he‚Äôd take it but it was agreed that he‚Äôd give it back,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,61,Fall,1904
it managed to spook me i still see him at 7 units though i know hes settled down a little 2 armies and 4 fleets still makes him the most powerful person on the board   which makes the division of france important i guess  do you care what i build with my french builds when i do,1,,0,italy,germany,3,62,Fall,1904
anyways i don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve tried to play me either so i will have your back when the time comes,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,63,Fall,1904
england asked me if id been organising a proxy war against him then seemed surprised when i had to ask him what that was üòÇ,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,64,Fall,1904
apparently france is telling england i told him that i was nervous of englands builds which is true and that i was trying to manipulate him which is not,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,65,Fall,1904
i don‚Äôt have a strong preference i will probably build armies next time i‚Äôm able to in order to work in central europe so maybe by building fleet we will balance out,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,66,Fall,1904
interestingyeah i can‚Äôt really tell what his long game is i get the sense he was worried about making too many enemies from the getgo which is why he pulled back a bit,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,67,Fall,1904
i know you have no particular reason to believe me but i dont lie in this game i tried back when i played face to face and felt guilty as well as being incredibly bad at it so its easier to play an open game and just try to be mindful of what i say to whom so yes when i saw france pouring in from the west i was very open about how nervous england made me about the same time i was screaming to you for help lol   england has been very very keen for me to take on turkey which id like to and may mean hell be attacking russia then when hes sure turkey will be distracted from sharing in the centers so hopefully thats what hes up to and not looking at our centers more locally,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,68,Fall,1904
but  if and when we fight england were going to need the fleets to do that so without particularly planning to fight him now ill be watching the ship counts all around between youandi vs him,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,69,Fall,1904
yes i agree and too hard to keep track of what i‚Äôve said to everyone üòÇ,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,70,Fall,1904
see truth is so much easier üòÇ,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,71,Fall,1904
face to face i would actually blush and start giggling if i was trying to lie to someone and they showed any doubt so yeah poker isnt my game i guess,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,72,Fall,1904
a few seasons ago england was worried about attacking russia while turkey was still strong i think for him and i both turkey makes us nervous since we have less of a read on him unfortunately i haven‚Äôt heard much from england recently so i am in the dark at this point i hope it‚Äôs legitimate life stuff getting in the way and not him ignoring me,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,73,Fall,1904
have you heard from him much since the weekend,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,74,Fall,1904
we had a looooooong chat yesterday when i could open my eyes over a dozen messages that was when i was accused of the proxy war and had to ask what he was talking about i didnt feel especially coherent but reading back the messages look better than i felt   hes very busy though i know so probably if hes not talking to you it means hes sure of you,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,75,Fall,1904
ok that lines up then,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,76,Fall,1904
lines up,1,,0,italy,germany,3,77,Fall,1904
with what hes told me and when he messaged me last,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,78,Fall,1904
oh  when did he tell you what wed been talking about  like i said open book here in italy,1,,0,italy,germany,3,79,Fall,1904
not much just that he told me he was busy and couldnt discuss i wasntt sure if it was a clever excuse to stonewall me or not haha,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,80,Fall,1904
ohhh haha,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,81,Fall,1904
he basically just said i could give him a moveset for this season because hes too busy to discuss anything,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,82,Fall,1904
its probably the 11 thing then,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,83,Fall,1904
soooo if you have any input im all ears,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,84,Fall,1904
maybe encourage him to try for mao and then descend on brest next season i dont know really i want to see him get into northern france but id prefer to see you do it,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,85,Fall,1904
if i cut support from bur he could take pic,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,86,Fall,1904
that could work im concerned about what mao would do but hell be mainly trying to fight england off i guess,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,87,Fall,1904
never mind he apparently already entered them i think hes generally holding in the west trying to push east,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,88,Fall,1904
hes being a little vague is he i guess it could be nerves but i wish i knew what he was doing   im trying to hold marseilles and push into spain for the record,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,89,Fall,1904
yeah the only specific was that hes holding in bel and he agreed to let me have swe and get another army built for working east im not sure if he wants to keep fleets  in the west or notguess we will find out soon enough üò¨,1,True,0,germany,italy,3,90,Fall,1904
indeed grabbing some food but ill be around after adjudication to look at the map and chat will you be here,1,True,0,italy,germany,3,91,Fall,1904
interesting looks as though one or both of you have made up with france again,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,92,Winter,1904
congratulations on making it to 7 though that was a beautifully timed move,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,93,Winter,1904
sorry i missed you ended up going to bed and thank you,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,94,Winter,1904
im not sure about the france situation i personally didnt talk to france at all this season maybe england still trusts france enough to leave him alone,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,95,Winter,1904
seems like england forgot to enter his moves,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,96,Spring,1905
my queen of the north how committed are you to your attack on austria at this point as you probably noticed austria and i had just begun our attack on turkey and now he is determined to double back and face you which i imagine means a new deal with turkey and the reconstruction of at block   unless  if you are committed to destroying him maybe its time we worked more directly together you and i,1,False,-1,italy,germany,3,97,Winter,1905
my fellow queen i didn‚Äôt want to attack austria but i even more so didn‚Äôt want to go after you or prod the english beast yet so i had the one choice of supply center to stay competitive this winter and austria had made it too easy  perhaps i should have waited longerbut it was bound to happen at some point i suppose i would be open to working with you to destroy and divide up austria and turkey let me know what you are thinking,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,98,Winter,1905
that seems like our best channel to make some significant progress in the game at this point as italy im generally reluctant to fight austria if its avoidable but im in the same position as you now i cant go west or i couldnt at that point and now all my units are in the wrong area and i cant fight turkey without support   now appears to the the point where we can resolve our local situation nicely ideally id prefer to appear to be moving to stop you in the spring and then declare my true allegiances in fall if that works for you maybe i could move to tyrolia to bounce you out only to end up there instead giving me more angles against trieste in the fall   the more france manages to stall or tie up england the better for us at this point i think there will come a time when we need to fight him to get to our twoway and if we can get a significant number advantage before england catches on then thats all to the better   i dont know what do you think   is it time for us to reach for that advantage,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,99,Winter,1905
yes that all generally makes sense to me i‚Äôm about to head out for the day but i‚Äôll take a closer look at the map and your suggestions later today and get back to you so we can coordinate for next season i think we can make this work,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,100,Winter,1905
in the meantime have a nice labor day,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,101,Winter,1905
you too,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,102,Winter,1905
ok just looked at the board closer and i cant think of any better ideas so lets go with your plan and we can feel out how well austria manages to coordinate with turkey and decide from there how to proceed austria said turkey is mad at him so im not sure how strong they will be together although i assume they will be forced to ally out of necessity,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,103,Spring,1906
oops i maybe misread earlier not sure if your intent was for us to bounce in tyr earlier but result was the same üôÇ are you still planning on using that unit for tri,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,104,Fall,1906
no it worked üôÇ my intent was to tell austria i was moving to tyr so that id bounce you if you moved there true but i didnt actually want you to go there im happy with where we both ended up and im definitely looking at tri provided i can preserve ven in the doing,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,105,Fall,1906
are you about to lose vie ill try to empty tyr this season id prefer you not move there if possible boh would be better,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,106,Fall,1906
perfect,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,107,Fall,1906
and  yeah i‚Äôm assuming i‚Äôll have to retreat from vie i‚Äôll stay out of tyr,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,108,Fall,1906
congrats on tri i‚Äôm going to retreat into boh,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,109,Fall,1906
thanks austria is understandably annoyed with me i‚Äôm not sure it will help to explain why but i‚Äôm going to try it anyway ,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,110,Fall,1906
well done with war no build loss then,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,111,Fall,1906
haha yeah austria started sending me generic threatening messages too he made a comment that ‚Äúboth of you betrayed me‚Äù but i‚Äôm not sure if he was referring to me and you or me and turkey,1,True,1,germany,italy,3,112,Fall,1906
he‚Äôs accusing me of eating pasta now be still my beating heart,1,True,-1,italy,germany,3,113,Fall,1906
wow what a low blow üòÇ,0,True,1,germany,italy,3,114,Fall,1906
hey there how was your weekend  im looking ahead to this year probably cleaning up austria and what comes next how do you want us to handle england im presuming the two of you wont have much trouble with france if and when you want it but im not sure you have the fleet power to take his home centers unless you surprise him or build up immensely,1,True,1,italy,germany,3,115,Spring,1907
hey hope you had a good weekend üôÇ yeah i expect austria and france will be gone soon honestly i haven‚Äôt really decided what to do about england,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,116,Spring,1907
i need more fleets but i also needed armies to take on austria which is why i‚Äôve basically just build those so far,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,117,Spring,1907
i‚Äôve been keeping clear of vienna as ‚Äúyour rightful territory‚Äù are you ready to reclaim that this fall or want to leave that for a later turn,1,True,1,italy,germany,3,118,Spring,1907
i appreciate it yeah it would be nice to reclaim this fall but i‚Äôm still unsure about how safe mun is without support from boh,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,119,Spring,1907
oops never mind about boh i can support with sil now,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,120,Spring,1907
are you able to support me into vie this season also for when you‚Äôre deciding on moves sounds like austria‚Äôs primary focus is tri although he mentioned potentially trying to get back bud,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,121,Fall,1907
it depends what austria does currently the only unit i can use to support vie is in bud which you warn me will have any support cut right now i have bud helping against serbia but if we feel that vie is more important that can change,1,True,1,italy,germany,3,122,Fall,1907
ok that makes sense i‚Äôm fine with you keeping bud helping serbia this season,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,123,Fall,1907
ahhh i misunderstood i thought you were cutting vie oh well ,1,True,1,italy,germany,3,124,Fall,1907
oh no sorry if i wasn‚Äôt clear ,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,125,Fall,1907
we live and we learn   no you were clear i just misunderstood it made sense when i went back to check,1,True,1,italy,germany,3,126,Fall,1907
what do you think of our shared king of england ,1,True,1,italy,germany,3,127,Fall,1907
so far he‚Äôs always followed through on his word,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,128,Fall,1907
he mentioned wanting a three way tie between you me and him,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,129,Fall,1907
what about you,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,130,Fall,1907
same we haven‚Äôt made many deals but so far he‚Äôs played ball i‚Äôm happy to go with the threeway plan i don‚Äôt have any allies this side of the board who seem able to stick with a plan for a year at a time so i‚Äôd prefer to work with you two,1,True,1,italy,germany,3,131,Fall,1907
sounds good i‚Äôm happy with that plan too,1,True,-1,germany,italy,3,132,Fall,1907
hey there could you please support bud  vie in spring and then i‚Äôll vacate it to you for fall i‚Äôm trying to squish the last austrian units so mun  tyr would be amazing too but i‚Äôll work around that if i need to,1,False,2,italy,germany,3,133,Spring,1908
i was thinking of moving bohvie was there a reason for you to get there first,1,True,-2,germany,italy,3,134,Spring,1908
only that i suspect turkey is going to cut my support  i‚Äôm happy to support you in there but i‚Äôm not confident i won‚Äôt get cut,1,True,2,italy,germany,3,135,Spring,1908
while if we squash them i‚Äôll get out and you won‚Äôt be sabotaging me in the fall love,1,True,2,italy,germany,3,136,Spring,1908
move,1,True,2,italy,germany,3,137,Spring,1908
very happy to follow your lead though,1,True,2,italy,germany,3,138,Spring,1908
ok i just played around with a few sandboxesi think best bet is for me to go for vie this season i can use gal for support and move muntyr to force austria to disband then you can focus on getting tri andor fighting turkey i def trust you to vacate vie but it seems like there is a chance you and turkey would bounce in bud in the fall and then we‚Äôd get stuck what do you think,1,True,-2,germany,italy,3,139,Spring,1908
turkey said he‚Äôs going for greece this season but i don‚Äôt really trust that,1,True,-2,germany,italy,3,140,Spring,1908
i‚Äôm happy with that as long as we force the disband so we can end this thing üòÉ,1,True,2,italy,germany,3,141,Spring,1908
sounds good üôÇ,1,True,-2,germany,italy,3,142,Spring,1908
did you get the same message i did from our noble king gwowohehe358278238675664896,1,True,2,italy,germany,3,143,Fall,1908
haha yes i did,1,True,-2,germany,italy,3,144,Fall,1908
so do i sweep on into turkey i can take them but if you and england are expecting to take a share we should talk about approach routes,1,True,3,italy,germany,3,145,Winter,1908
a while ago england and i talked about turkey he said he‚Äôd use his unit in moscow to help me into turkey although idk exactly how that will all play out i‚Äôll talk to him about it and you can too and keep each other in touch,1,True,-3,germany,italy,3,146,Spring,1909
ok england is going to support me into ukr this season and i think sev eventually,1,True,-3,germany,italy,3,147,Spring,1909
can you please support ukr  sev,1,True,-3,germany,italy,3,148,Fall,1909
i already have üòÉ,1,True,3,italy,germany,3,149,Fall,1909
danke üôÇ,1,True,-3,germany,italy,3,150,Fall,1909
im not especially interested in trying to steal an advantage here how do you feel about using your a sev to deliver the killing blow to ankara and then we settle with a 3way draw in winter 1910   if youd prefer to indulge in a bit of regicide ill be your willing ally but im aware that looks like a risky proposition with my extensive southern estates  your call kaiserin,1,True,5,italy,germany,3,151,Winter,1909
thats just what i was thinking i will move towards ank on land unless you want to set up a convoy in the black sea and we can settle with the 3way draw then,1,True,-5,germany,italy,3,152,Spring,1910
it wouldnt happen fast enough if we only have two more moves ill support you into arm and then into ank and click the box to adjudicate early,1,True,5,italy,germany,3,153,Spring,1910
true i just realized we only have two more seasons i was a bit leery of the fact that ill leave sev open for england to move into but with the time limit i guess its a moot point,1,True,-5,germany,italy,3,154,Spring,1910
just to make sure i understand correctly youre saying to click the box to adjudicate once everyone submits orders in fall 1910,1,True,-5,germany,italy,3,155,Spring,1910
yes please,1,True,5,italy,germany,3,156,Spring,1910
it will just help us get there a little faster,1,True,5,italy,germany,3,157,Spring,1910
you‚Äôre on board with the grand convoy of 1910,1,True,-5,germany,italy,3,158,Spring,1910
england said you were too,1,True,-5,germany,italy,3,159,Spring,1910
yes from nwy to syria while you punch into ankara party in the palace in constantinople,1,True,5,italy,germany,3,160,Spring,1910
sounds good to me,1,True,-5,germany,italy,3,161,Spring,1910
üéâüéâ,1,True,-5,germany,italy,3,162,Spring,1910
sweden to syria then,1,True,5,italy,germany,3,163,Fall,1910
yes its go time,1,True,-5,germany,italy,3,164,Fall,1910
cheers to the final season i‚Äôve entered my build with threeway draw selected,1,True,-4,germany,italy,3,165,Winter,1910
hey neighbour 3 if we put our minds to it we can either work amazingly together this game or flail pointlessly at one another while other powers rise and rise and rise   i‚Äôd really like to work towards option one so let‚Äôs agree not to attack each other between ven  tri at least not this year we have more important things to do,1,False,0,italy,austria,3,0,Spring,1901
that sounds good to me im wary of germany will you watch my back if i watch yours,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,1,Spring,1901
i haven‚Äôt heard anything from germany to suggest they have designs on you but i‚Äôll keep an eye out in comms we all have a stake in keeping tyrolia free have you spoken with russia yet,1,False,0,italy,austria,3,2,Spring,1901
they seem nice enough just wanted to be careful since they havent been speaking as much russia seems nice enough havent really gotten any info from russia,0,True,0,austria,italy,3,3,Spring,1901
russia said something to be about an alliance before the three of us against turkey before we turn our gaze westward did he mention that to you and if so how do you feel about it,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,4,Spring,1901
italy vs turkey is almost classic though it does depend on an agreement like the one we discussed ,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,5,Spring,1901
well turkey just told me that he was in an agreement with russia not sure if that is to try to threaten me or if russia is just playing everyone,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,6,Spring,1901
hummm maybe you and i should both query russia on this and compare notes,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,7,Spring,1901
juggernaut would be no fun at all,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,8,Spring,1901
russia talked about previous experience and using that to suggest going for turkey id believe that but i would also believe he playing both sides to try to turkey then hoping to jump myself in the aftermath,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,9,Spring,1901
or he could even be lying to turkey for a s01 advantage though that could be a little concerning i doubt i‚Äôm in the winning draw this game but i‚Äôd prefer a little more success than being someone‚Äôs grabbag of points   it‚Äôs early yet but how do you feel about an italian greece,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,10,Spring,1901
itd be nice if russia would at least let us know a bit how do you pose the question without making russia suspicious,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,11,Spring,1901
i subtly said ‚Äúi heard this what‚Äôs going on‚Äù,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,12,Spring,1901
i didn‚Äôt say who told me mind you 3,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,13,Spring,1901
okay ill hold off and ask later so it isnt too obvious its us talking,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,14,Spring,1901
oh i hadn‚Äôt thought of that good idea,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,15,Spring,1901
fairly conventional openings all around really unless you‚Äôre concerned by a gal i see either you or turkey could deny greece to the other but if you move in you lose serbia as a build  what if you support me into greece instead from naples and i can then either support you into bulgaria next year or attack southern turkey by sea as you prefer,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,16,Fall,1901
im not immediately concerned by russias move but it doesnt exactly seem in line with how he seemed to be aligning with us it could also just be a soft open to not put turkey on edge ill support your move into greece and by then im assuming well see how russia intends to play,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,17,Fall,1901
works for me i don‚Äôt lie as a rule in these games largely because i suck at it and it makes me uncomfortable so believe me when i say russia‚Äôs comms to me have all been pointed at fighting turkey   i‚Äôve asked him again what‚Äôs going on keep you posted,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,18,Fall,1901
it seems the fight turkey has a positive effect for all three of us so i think that would be the simplest action would also make since to lie to one person as opposed to two,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,19,Fall,1901
im also planning on moving my fleet into the adr just a heads up,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,20,Fall,1901
he tells me he forgot to change his initial orders to galicia which may be true and that the fight vs turkey is still on which i do believe   your logic supports this as well so i‚Äôm going to take my life in my hands and empty venice this season heading south,1,,0,italy,austria,3,21,Fall,1901
thanks for the heads up but why,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,22,Fall,1901
good point realized i could support serbia from land,1,False,0,austria,italy,3,23,Fall,1901
f trieste moving to albania then i‚Äôd ideally like to see a dmz in the adriatic if you agree,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,24,Fall,1901
yeah that works fine for me,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,25,Fall,1901
serbia isn‚Äôt really under threat at this point worst comes to the worst and bulgaria attacks and cuts your support but if you build a bud this year you should be good to advance into bul in 1902 with italian support,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,26,Fall,1901
speaking which need me to get out of the way of your f alb or is it staying on your coast for now,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,27,Fall,1901
ill probably stay coastal until we push out turkey then figure out from there,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,28,Fall,1901
that works fine with me,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,29,Fall,1901
so about that support into greece looks like russia lied to both of us as well,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,30,Winter,1901
id believe it though they said that they made a mistake moving into gal and were going to move into rum i think that the plan to take out turkey is still happening,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,31,Winter,1901
you want me to support you into greece,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,32,Winter,1901
well not any more since im in there fortunately i  didnt need the support you promised me last season ,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,33,Winter,1901
honestly the way russia has been playing id rather they make the big pushes into turkey with our support i feel like that gives us the best opportunity to not get double crossed by russia with the aid of turkey,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,34,Winter,1901
do you need my support for that or am i good to focus on keeping france out of the mediterranean i had been planning on doing a second fleet and convoying into syria but im a little warier of russia than i was last season,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,35,Winter,1901
i think im fine so far just wanted to let you know my thoughts on russia  i get the feeling that they will follow through until turkey is done but that point not sure what theyre next move is,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,36,Winter,1901
or how much that may be impacted by england in norway now you would not believe the press i got from him earlier today,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,37,Winter,1901
from russia threat from england may benefit us and allow us to get more territory from turkey when the dust settles,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,38,Winter,1901
from england its not really relevant to our discussion but im still a little angry about it   calming though dont worry about an emotional loose cannon to your south west ,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,39,Winter,1901
always good to hear,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,40,Winter,1901
russia said their orders didnt take kind of suspicious giving everything previous i think theyre trying to let either turkey or i make the first aggression then decide who to support from there,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,41,Winter,1901
i think you‚Äôre right,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,42,Spring,1902
maybe he keeps making interface errors but i think he‚Äôs being cagey and trying to keep his options open until you two commit,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,43,Spring,1902
so does that mean we do want to commit to turkey or do you think we should try to seek common ground and you two hit russia while i do something else i guess,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,44,Spring,1902
i think im just going to hold until i have a clearer idea of whats going on russia said in the beginning they have experienced multiple games so i doubt they managed to make a mistake twice in a row,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,45,Spring,1902
alright then we have time to consider our moves over the next 2 days but i need to brainstorm to what i can do against turkey if youre not able to move in my support   can you make any suggestions i dont see a classic lepanto working against two turkish fleets facing west,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,46,Spring,1902
i can support your army from gre into bul with my fleet in alb if you want to move into turkey id like to my russia side armies where they are in case russia tries something funny any thoughts,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,47,Spring,1902
otherwise i want to try to get a better understanding of russia and turkeys plans while my units hold,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,48,Spring,1902
okay yes please support my army greece to bulgaria with anything you can i understand wanting to keep a firm border with russia what are your plans for army trieste,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,49,Spring,1902
was going to let it sit but i can move it to ser if that makes you more comfortable dont want to move to bud and make russia think im antagonizing,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,50,Spring,1902
dont you already have an army in ser though   if you dont want to do anything in particular with them you could always bounce yourself in vienna from trieste and budapest personally id be happier seeing your army not next to my open home center but i get that russia is a bigger more enigmatic neighbour that youd prefer to avoid provoking,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,51,Spring,1902
still new to this really i have my fleet and arm supporting you in gre moving into bul thought i could also move my other army into ser,1,False,0,austria,italy,3,52,Spring,1902
since we have two days to make decisions have you considered allying with turkey and moving onto russia purely speculative but we could try to get england to push from the top and turkey and i push from the south then you and i watch germany and france to make sure they dont take advantage of england,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,53,Spring,1902
i‚Äôve considered it i think i even suggested it it puts a lot of weight on russia probably enough that even he gets smooshed fast the problem from my standpoint is that it doesn‚Äôt give me a lot to do with my two strong allies fighting north although i suppose i could take tunis and then move west against france   i‚Äôll want a firm agreement and an open border if we do that though because if i‚Äôm going to break into france i need to take virtually every  unit i have,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,54,Spring,1902
bed now but i‚Äôll be up in a few and will look out for your thoughts  good night,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,55,Spring,1902
i really am nervous about your units in albania and serbia im not sure where id prefer your fleet to be unless you want me to kill it so you can rebuild as an army but i know that between that and your build in trieste i keep getting more suspicious than you deserve,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,56,Spring,1902
part of that is probably frances fleet in spain south coast as well,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,57,Spring,1902
id personally prefer my units unkilled have both of those units currently set to support you into bulgaria,1,False,0,austria,italy,3,58,Spring,1902
realistically the only real worry i have now is russia id like to clear up something to my west that keeps me from getting sandwiched so im not really trying to fight with either you or germany,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,59,Spring,1902
are you sure theres a time honoured tradition of friendly kills helping with unit conversion and it would give you an extra army instead of a fleet thats mostly trapped     no youre right i guess this tension is getting to everyone im not prepared to go to bulgaria this season so please dont worry about supporting me with either unit in one of my attacks of paranoia earlier after you didnt support me into greece  dont worry im over it i agreed to turkeys request to support him into serbia from greece this season  a decision i now regret,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,60,Spring,1902
would you prefer i tell him im not doing it or that i go through with it and you block the supported attack i wish id drawn another power or that the alliances were more clear or that we had any idea what was going on in russias head   im used to f2f play in school  this is very different and much murkier and im still worried about france maybe a cautious expansion to tunis this year is more my speed,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,61,Spring,1902
this is my first experience with this game so im not sure how to proceed really all i know is that russia seems to be trying to play everyone,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,62,Spring,1902
oh goodness we are doomed then im not much better ive played a couple of games with very mixed results i agree that russia seems to be trying get everyone onside though   do you have a mentor or a friend whos played before im considering asking one of my diplo friends for advice but im not sure if that would be against the spirit of the study,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,63,Spring,1902
i asked the admin hes happy for us to ask more experienced friends for tips 3,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,64,Spring,1902
to explain context i was very spooked by your building a new army right next to my undefended home centre in trieste vienna is at least safely 1 centre away but in trieste means i cant leave venice open no matter how much i trust you   given im moving to venice this season can we please move back away again rather than staring at each other over the border,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,65,Spring,1902
if youre not sure then its better we dont do anything too bold im going to tell turkey i dont feel comfortable supporting him in attacking you i dont and that we should all stop and look at russia for a bit,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,66,Spring,1902
okay to clarify then i have my arm in tri moving to vie and alb and ser supporting gre into bul,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,67,Spring,1902
if youre not attacking then i will just have my units hold or support,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,68,Spring,1902
im not attacking if things settle a bit and i have some assurance about what france and russia are doing and with the relief of trieste opening up maybe we can explore this in fall to give him limited time to respond,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,69,Spring,1902
i am moving a rom  ven this season but mostly because im concerned with what france is doing if he goes somewhere other than pied ill move back south or arrange a fake fight over trieste if you like   if we arrange a bounce it could be interesting to see who tries to take advantage of our apparent squabble 3,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,70,Spring,1902
that would be interesting to see what happens if it appears were fight ill have my ser and alb hold then,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,71,Spring,1902
i‚Äôm glad i moved west imagine the damage france could have done if he‚Äôd broken through venice and popped up on your other border let me know if you need any help from my boys in greece who will otherwise eat souvlaki and catch up on their classical education 3,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,72,Fall,1902
yeah i guess france is trying to get hostile and must have some sort of nonaggression with germany and england england asked if i got the memo on russia do you know what theyre talking about,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,73,Fall,1902
i believe russia has been offering people a lot of deals  nothing we hadnt already suspected though,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,74,Fall,1902
im curious what the memo was and who was sending it did england say anything to you,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,75,Fall,1902
he told me that russia was trying to organise a northern alliance with him and germany but i wasnt certain how far i believed it it didnt seem to make much sense with the moves we were seeing you know,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,76,Fall,1902
had heard that russia told me they was supporting me into bul again but i dont think i want to make moves i think if we can at least get germany on our side turkey germany and myself can take out russia,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,77,Fall,1902
well germany should want a strong austria right though i admit id prefer germany help me with france,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,78,Fall,1902
its up to you im fine slowly taking russia out and moving my army in vie down to support  you in ven if youre comfortable with that,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,79,Fall,1902
id welcome your support from tyrolia that should help us to push back on piedmont if he doesnt change direction now he knows hes not going to surprise me,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,80,Fall,1902
alright im going to talk to turkey to see if theyre interested in make the push also im waiting to get a response from england one what they meant about the memo about russia if they make a push from the north we can probably take out russia in a few seasons,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,81,Fall,1902
any word and are you still able to support my a ven to pie this turn england is up to 7 now which makes me a little worried about his ultimate intentions as he may be a more polished version of our russian neighbour but with the centers to run for a lead if we aren‚Äôt careful,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,82,Spring,1903
yeah im about to leave vie exposed to russia and move my fleet from alb into tyr are you talking with turkey maybe support either them or me from greece while we attack russia in bul,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,83,Spring,1903
i spoke to him this morning he suggested i support him into bul as part of your joint push against russia and a small part of it i can actually reach to support so i agreed to do so is that a problem   if you‚Äôd prefer i do something else please let me know i consider you my closest ally,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,84,Spring,1903
no that works perfectly for me thats what he just told me his plans were so i think we can trust him until russia is no longer a threat,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,85,Spring,1903
also i have tyr supporting ven into pie,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,86,Spring,1903
then i will order venpie and use my fleets to counter him in tys and in africa once in piedmont my army should be able to hold the connection with marseilles and it becomes a fleet battle again  where i have him 32  maybe i can persuade him to go away and worry about england growing at his back,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,87,Spring,1903
yeah england is certainly getting some momentum,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,88,Spring,1903
possibly in the interests of boardbalance we should offer a treaty to russia after we clear the immediate area while he‚Äôs still strong enough to threaten english scandinavia,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,89,Spring,1903
we could all i know is either russia or turkey is going to end up out of here based on our actions russia told me turkeys moves didnt do anything to them and that theyd still work with me so im guessing they know that our decisions make or break them,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,90,Spring,1903
are you alright with me moving tyr to vie to prevent russia from trying to take it,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,91,Fall,1903
i‚Äôm fine with that my french front is stable now thanks to your well timed assistance england and germany are hoping you and i will help them deal with turkey‚Äôs expansion after france is driven back but privately i think we need to be careful how large england gets in the meantime  what do you need from my a greece this season do you need me bringing units back east or am i clear to keep chasing france,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,92,Fall,1903
i agree about the eastern front i think greece is fine to move back to help your push,1,False,-1,austria,italy,3,93,Fall,1903
ill see what i can do when i get a fleet into the right waters id like to have that army over west but not at the cost of losing two units for a year getting it there,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,94,Fall,1903
what are your plans this season are you ready to push up into galicia and points russian or are you still eyeing turkey  i cant get greece out of there yet but hopefully if i can get a french build i can build something that will let me move it away although we are going to need to look at turkey eventually i know,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,95,Spring,1904
looking to push for russia if we split on turkey early it will only end with all of us getting overrun once russia is done we can figure out how to move from there it seems like england is fighting france and germany now so no one is going to get too much for free,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,96,Spring,1904
i agree theres no sense in a war with turkey at this point we just need to keep an eye on his builds and where theyre positioned im probably tied up in the west at the moment anyway so theres a limit to how far i could help but i think maybe i should leave a greece where it is rather than trying to come up with an excuse to move it back there when were ready  how was your weekend,1,True,0,italy,austria,3,97,Spring,1904
yeah im always open to a little support no matter what,1,True,0,austria,italy,3,98,Spring,1904
congratulations on your build üôÇ how are things in austria   with russia descending in flames where would you like us to look next   im still tightly embroiled in france but im pretty sure i could get free of them if you needed me elsewhere,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,99,Winter,1904
id like to to go after either england or france next but obviously i cant help too much without moving through either you or england once russia is completely gone we could move on turkey i told germany the only way i see any of us surviving is by working together and that the first person to betray the other two would probably just last a little longer so im fine trusting the center and moving my armies east and south once russia is gone,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,100,Winter,1904
russia is down to 1 center id say unless youre strongly committed to not fighting turkey before russia is dead we may do better to move now and offer the last russian center to germany as part of a deal to keep them off our back when we move  the question is what we expect eg to do while were moving on t i dont have an answer to that right now but swapping straight back to triple has to be a temptation,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,101,Winter,1904
what do you say  do you want me to move east now or stay in the west with france  i agree a triple central powers benefits us all here,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,102,Spring,1905
depends what youre comfortable with we can probably take out turkey fairly quickly after russia if we put our mind to it that would certainly make me feel safer not having any threats to my east but it also looks like youre making good progress in the west,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,103,Spring,1905
im concerned about what the other people will be doing while we do that youre not wrong though i could hack my way slowly through france but that frees england to work his magic on germany after russia falls   alternatively if we move on turkey now an angry france will probably turn back on england or at least i hope so   oh if it comes up england asked me if youre doing what i tell you or doing what turkey tells you   i said you were listening to me which is strictly true even if it doesnt mean youre like my puppet or anything just so you dont get the wrong idea if you hear it in press üòÇ,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,104,Spring,1905
change of plans im building fleets and sailing for england,1,False,-1,austria,italy,3,105,Spring,1905
lol dont underestimate him though i think hes very good at influencing people on the other side of the board to do what he wants and if hes underestimating you then thats his mistake  and not one im going to make  he challenged me that i was running a proxy war  with france and he then had to explain what he was talking about before i could respond i think maybe hes doing something similar trying to keep the rest of the map in a state of tension while he carefully expands,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,106,Spring,1905
yeah id believe that at least he was nice enough to explain things as he sees it  if were going to move on turkey what would you think the best course of action is i think you moving your fleet in ion to pressure smy and con would allow me to move and take either bul or sev and then your support could help us take ank with either the fleet or your army in gre,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,107,Spring,1905
maybe i could support you into bul in the spring if you have serbia covered   meanwhile i move my fleet up to menace smy and con where you suggest and then you can support my a gre convoying into con  or attacking smy if that seems more vulnerable  once were past con and have him out of position he should be easy enough to pull down before the west gets out of control how many fleets do you think i should bring east  how many should i leave guarding the med,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,108,Spring,1905
that seems like a reasonable plan im trying to get germany onboard with taking out england in stp so we dont have them meddling in the east i think at this point russia is basically a nonfactor unless we really get outmaneuvered once i get some sort of confirmation from germany ill have rum move into bul and gal into ukr with bud moving into rum should i start moving my fleet down into alb do you think,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,109,Spring,1905
i was going to say i‚Äôd prefer it stay put but actually how do you feel about the adriatic that way i can leave my a at venice and then maybe you can convoy me into albania in fall it obscures what we‚Äôre up to a little longer and gets more italians in to turkey,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,110,Spring,1905

i misread you previous message as a choice between my attacking with support or convoying hopefully my reading error doesnt set us back too much,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,122,Winter,1905
also looks like germany is allying with england so im going to have to move my units back to address that threat,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,123,Winter,1905

now thats just rude,1,True,-1,austria,italy,3,132,Fall,1906
you‚Äôre not wrong and i am sorry about that for the record i was wholly committed to our attack on turkey so that‚Äôs the reason i was moving over germany‚Äôs stab and your necessary pull back to deal with it meant i had to stop and think and talk with everyone and here we are,1,True,1,italy,austria,3,133,Fall,1906

ive been on both the giving and receiving ends of multiple games in which austria italy and russia decided that their games would be much simpler if there wasnt a turkey around and it always was i propose that we start the game off by coordinating a removal of turkey before moving on to other priorities,1,True,1,russia,italy,3,0,Spring,1901
seems well reasoned coordinated direct and decisive just what i like to see out of a prospective partner for the future when im an enthusiastic rather than dangerous player sure why not im in  if i hear from austria that he is as well that would remove a lot of pressure off my immediate borders and have me looking to a future decorated in winter and green what do you think  oh and hi there,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,1,Spring,1901
sounds excellent to me italyrussia is a very strong longterm alliance,1,True,1,russia,italy,3,2,Spring,1901
so ive heard ive played exactly one game as italy since i discovered diplomacy online still ongoing and our wintergreen is presently well on the way to a threeway draw with france if mostly because i cant persuade the tsar that a twoway would be more interesting,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,3,Spring,1901
so tell me how do you find terraforming mars im a bit of a highkey space fanatic and one of my friends has been on me to try it forever but i dont find i have a lot of time for gaming worth a look or something thats fun but not for long,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,4,Spring,1901
ive played about three dozen games at this point i think and every time theres something new or interesting that happens heartily recommended,1,True,1,russia,italy,3,5,Spring,1901
ohhh i must try it then i dabble in kerbal when the mood suits and im definitely into intrasystem expansion so it may be a great way to while away sleepless nights,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,6,Spring,1901
no news from austria yet but its a global game and a lower chance of nmrs than usual ill worry if i havent heard from him in 12 hours some discussion with turkey he seems keen for me to attack austria and for him to expand to bulgaria and greece which is fairly classic play i guess,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,7,Spring,1901
yeah no one is really doing anything out of the ordinary as far as i can tell,1,True,1,russia,italy,3,8,Spring,1901
agreed i was briefly concerned about the risks of an anglogerman alliance but nothing coming out of either power suggests that was any more than my paranoia at work,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,9,Spring,1901
if we don‚Äôt hear anything from austria should we consider a reverse on your original plan russia italy turkey vs austria  and then russia and italy vs turkey when the time comes the west will be so relieved they aren‚Äôt looking at a juggernaut i‚Äôll be over the southern stalemate lines before they can stop us,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,10,Spring,1901
im fine with that no matter what im planning on you and me eventually crushing someone between us be it austria or turkey,1,True,1,russia,italy,3,11,Spring,1901
heh insomniacs unite in the spirit of full disclosure and full diplomatic flexibility you can generally reach me within 2 hours at most day or night i don‚Äôt sleep that well  but happily that‚Äôs a benefit in the global game what is it 2 there,1,,-1,italy,russia,3,12,Spring,1901
just about im not good at sleep schedules,1,True,1,russia,italy,3,13,Spring,1901
and looking forward to it,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,14,Spring,1901
hey there a little bird whispered in my ear that turkey thinks he has an agreement with you since austria has finally popped up which alliance is real,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,15,Spring,1901
hello opening moves look largely in keeping with your suggestion against turkey though galicia could mean austria is the focus what is the plan alliance partner,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,16,Fall,1901
im sticking with the antiturkey plan  the galicia move was an initial move that i forgot to update,1,False,1,russia,italy,3,17,Fall,1901
gotcha you may want to reassure austria of that too i know i‚Äôd be alarmed if i was the archduke looking up to see the tsar‚Äôs imperial guard on approach   maybe use galicia to seize rumania to prove a point and allay turkey‚Äôs suspicions with your apparent attack on austria this season,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,18,Fall,1901
exactly what im planning to do,1,True,1,russia,italy,3,19,Fall,1901
great sorry im still new to this so when something neat occurs to me i feel the need to share my brilliant and original realisation xd,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,20,Fall,1901
its all good,1,True,1,russia,italy,3,21,Fall,1901
you gonna take a shot at greece,1,True,1,russia,italy,3,22,Fall,1901
do you think i should i‚Äôm strongly considering it but there‚Äôs a little voice that says not to risk the bounce and stick with the build i know i have,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,23,Fall,1901
well i told the turk im supporting him into rumania when im actually supporting the austrian into bulgaria and myself into rumania so if you go to greece you get the build and you cut off the turkish retreat so hes stuck at 3 and were all in place to crunch him down,1,True,1,russia,italy,3,24,Fall,1901
okay that sounds like a reasonable call i guess even if i bounce it denies him the retreat option although if i‚Äôm stuck on 3 while you‚Äôre all collecting 12 builds i worry i‚Äôll spend the game trying to become useful again,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,25,Fall,1901
you have my word that if youre left buildless ill give you priority in getting austrian dots youll have my support in,1,True,1,russia,italy,3,26,Fall,1901
alright my friend i‚Äôll do it,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,27,Fall,1901

both turkey and austria are concerned about your movements and are asking me if i trust you,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,32,Spring,1902

uh oh it looks like france is committed then and i find it unlikely he‚Äôd leave himself wide open to england and germany if he didn‚Äôt expect them to take his side  how are things on your side,1,True,-1,italy,russia,3,38,Fall,1902

good morning my sultan how are things we have a number of common interests the balkans austria the med russia and im looking forward to discussing them with you please accept this gift of fine italian chianti,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,0,Spring,1901
buongiorno i hope we can honestly discuss these interests as well are you planning to open agressively,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,1,Spring,1901
buongiorno  theres only so aggressive i can be sultan i havent even mentioned the idea of a lepanto to austria and im principally focused on getting a build in tunis or greece this year where are you looking at things,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,2,Spring,1901
well i would strongly encourage you to visit tunis in return id be happy to offer you support if sometime in the future you decide the map has too much austria on it,1,False,0,turkey,italy,3,3,Spring,1901
well tunis is pretty much guaranteed for me and it will be there in 1902 if i find juicier fruit in 1901 are you suggesting i try my luck in trieste instead and that youll be happy to support me the war against austria that will likely immediately follow   one of my friends is in another game where his i and a friendly t are advancing well against a chaotic russiaaustria alliance,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,4,Spring,1901
you had me at against austria yes i think that the two of us working together against austriarussia would be a good plan and later when we trust each other better im sure we could coordinate in the mediterranean to help you expand westward  while i expand north,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,5,Spring,1901
some cautious discussions with austria this spring and i‚Äôve committed not to try for trieste this year so it looks as though it will be a single build winter for you as well or have you been able to negotiate safe passage to greece,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,6,Fall,1901
im working on itif i get a promise from austria ill let you know,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,7,Fall,1901
welp it appears that neither austria nor russia are speaking to me this suggests they might be working together in case thats useful information,1,False,0,turkey,italy,3,8,Fall,1901
that is interesting im still getting press from both though nothing that suggests a solid alliance between the two nerves uncertainties and some remarks heard  directly or indirectly  from russia that make me wonder what his long game is here,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,9,Fall,1901
last turn russia offered conflicting promises to me and austria both or so ive heard once i found that out i never heard from either of them again so its not too many dots to connect to think they may have some kind of arrangement i would guess maybe they plan to split the map roughly horizontally and take me out first,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,10,Fall,1901
it could be so it looks like theyre not coordinating well if thats their plan though i was aligned with them last turn but a few promises didnt quite flower to fruition and right now im more concerned with what france is doing in southern spain,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,11,Winter,1901
apparently russia just makes empty promises to everyone so i hear from northern players anyway so i think its best if russia is just ignored or treated with extreme suspicion   you mean youre worried about france seizing the mediterranean,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,12,Winter,1901
that was what i meant yes since i ended up leaving tunis for the new year seeing the bounce on munich allayed that concern nicely though and i‚Äôve exchanged a few notes with france since that convince me i‚Äôm able to look to my east for a little longer at least,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,13,Spring,1902
and yes russia does seem more than a little promise happy  does that make him a commitment phobe do you think or is he counting on some of us to say no so he‚Äôs not stuck in contradictory commitments,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,14,Spring,1902
probably the latter  so does focusing on the east mean that theres anything i might be able to help you with,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,15,Spring,1902
that‚Äôs a good question   classicly i suppose i should be focusing on a lepanto approach and i‚Äôm certainly uncomfortable with your fleets in con and smy it‚Äôs also the bill of goods russia‚Äôs been trying to sell austria and i   on the other hand that depends on us being able to trust what russia is up to and frankly i‚Äôm not certain of him at all i was committed to supporting a ser into bul this year in exchange for his support into greece but if we go back to the order log we can both see that didn‚Äôt happen  what do you have in mind my immediate objectives are taking tunis keeping my coastal waters italian and finding a friendshipalliance i can trust to take me to the late game hopefully a 2way draw,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,16,Spring,1902
ah what a relief to finally hear what sounds like honesty  those fleets were mainly meant to defend against a lepanto and fate willing maybe seize the black sea that i naively ceded when i was young and trusting point is theyre not a threat to you especially since youre the only neighbor of mine willing to talk to me they might even be useful for you in a few turns if im still around  i assume you want do dedicate your nap fleet to snagging tunis and does the coastal waters thing mean youre concerned about the adriatic if not then what i hoped was that you might be willing to support bulser while stabbing albania from the sea this could set us up to start pushing back on austria from the south and id support you into serbia if i thought thatd be worth anything but given that bul is surrounded by enemies i just doubt the support would go through,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,17,Spring,1902
id like that and i agree its a huge relief to cut through the nervous diplomatic doublespeak   i think its perfectly understandable for turkey to want to defend against a lepanto especially when italy is sounding cautious and doesnt really have many other options to expand ive just built a second fleet but then i think i need that to escape my boot whichever way im going   i am concerned about the adriatic but not sure im moving into it this year i agree with your analysis of bul youre going to get hit although it might be hard to bring up a new unit into bul to replace your army there are you hoping to feed f con to the east coast you might need an aegean fleet to force your way up which should probably be yours unless  youre willing to extend me that much trust this early  were assuming a supported attack on serbia will get you in yes austria does have a lot of units around there cut at albania or no  bianca de medici,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,18,Spring,1902
i agree with you that its not likely to work given all the units austria has around but its the best i could come up with i was planning to move a fleet to the aegean for support next season as you suggest   do you know anything about what austria and russia are planning,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,19,Spring,1902
also im open to any counter offers if you have them,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,20,Spring,1902
reliably no  generally speaking i think they‚Äôre trying to defeat you but how they‚Äôre planning on doing it i‚Äôm not clear they both lied to me last turn  and as far as i can tell to each other   i don‚Äôt have a better offer really except that if we make any progress against austria i would expect russia to start courting us instead,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,21,Spring,1902
that sounds onbrand for russia it‚Äôll fall on deaf turkish ears though so can i count on your support,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,22,Spring,1902
yes let‚Äôs do this thing my friend  b de m,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,23,Spring,1902
im getting nervous about austria in serbia and albania and i dont want to lose greece im also sorry getting nervous about your two fleets facing west what with my more experienced friend telling me that italy and turkey always fight   thats not true is it,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,24,Spring,1902
im still not going to attack you but i think i cant attack austria either here sorry i need to sit tight and wait for russia and france to commit themselves maybe france will butt out of the med with his northern worries but maybe he wont too and in italy we need freedom of the seas,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,25,Spring,1902
i understand your hesitation to attack austria but if you dont trust them then its better to resist sooner rather than later when they become more powerful at my expense  your experienced friend is wrong theres no reason turkey and italy have to fight even if it does happen somewhat often in this instance youre the last person on the board id want to fight with,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,26,Spring,1902
well im glad we didnt agree to stab austria actually since it looks like austria has flipped on russia  id still like to help you out any way i can but it looks like you might be focusing on the west for a bit just know that as far as i can tell neither austria nor i have intentions with greece right now,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,27,Fall,1902
austria did start to talk to me again and said as much,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,28,Fall,1902
thank you i‚Äôm much happier with my suspicions drawn to a worthy target and i‚Äôm glad we didn‚Äôt start fighting austria in the balkans while france ran up my back do you have a plan for getting back control of the black sea you certainly don‚Äôt have to look out for me any more we have a frenchman to scold ,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,29,Fall,1902
don‚Äôt you worry about the black sea this ol‚Äô sultan has a few tricks up her sleeve üòâ,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,30,Fall,1902
i look forward to seeing what you do next your fleets are certainly ready,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,31,Fall,1902
sending to italy and austria  france germany and england‚Äôs behavior combined with some things england has said to me smell of a triple alliance between those three do you agree or have any additional evidence if so i want to make sure southeast europe is prepared to push back against such a threat,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,32,Fall,1902
a few things i‚Äôve heard sound triplish and the current french position certainly looks like they‚Äôve made some sort of deal doesn‚Äôt it they aren‚Äôt going to sneak by me though so it really depends what eg do,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,33,Fall,1902
so i know this is last minute but i just got austria to support me from ser into rum i was wondering if youd be willing to bumpborrow bul this turn i highly doubt austria would try and swipe it from you,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,34,Fall,1902
i just dont want russia to have it,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,35,Fall,1902
too last minute sorry i was asleep i‚Äôll go see what happened in the update,1,True,1,italy,turkey,3,36,Winter,1902
it looks like youll be able to push back on france a bit this year i think you and austria should work together to move you into piedmontwhat do you think,1,True,-1,turkey,italy,3,37,Spring,1903
i was also wondering whether your greece army might be willing to support conbul ec,1,True,-1,turkey,italy,3,38,Spring,1903
good morning my friendly sultan still a bit asleep here but agree with both your points happy to support you into bul ec this season and very much hoping austria will support me in driving france back out of my immediate area how have you been nearing the end of a very long week here and looking forward to spending more time looking over the map,1,True,1,italy,turkey,3,39,Spring,1903
well im so glad youll be taking some time to get back to whats important   ive been notsobusy and looking at the map kind of a lotthanks for the support and ill gently try to convince austria in your favor as well,1,True,-1,turkey,italy,3,40,Spring,1903
hahahaha well it‚Äôs diplomacy and so and not having to spend all day up to my ears in campus things but yes important to focus on what‚Äôs important  i appreciate your support,1,True,1,italy,turkey,3,41,Spring,1903
id sure hate to be france right now great job claiming mare nostrum üôÇ,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,42,Spring,1904
thanks how are things in the east still have russia well contained or do you need anything from greece or the rest of me  we‚Äôre at your service here while not wanting to drive in where we aren‚Äôt needed,1,True,0,italy,turkey,3,43,Spring,1904
don‚Äôt need anything just trying to give credit where it‚Äôs due,1,True,0,turkey,italy,3,44,Spring,1904
congratulations on your build how are things in the east with russia dying from all sides do you have any immediate plans for where we go next from here  i imagine france would be open to a deal that had me moving away again,1,True,1,italy,turkey,3,45,Winter,1904
sorry i didnt respond to thisi hope that move to the ionian is not signalling that youre ready to turn on me,1,True,-1,turkey,italy,3,46,Spring,1905
i moved there so i could convoy greece out since he‚Äôs not doing any good there any more did you have another use for him,1,True,1,italy,turkey,3,47,Spring,1905
congrats on smooshing russia so effectively,1,True,1,italy,turkey,3,48,Spring,1905
ah thank you but the smooshing was so effective that now england and germany are swooping in like buzzards   and thats a relief about greece does this mean no truce with france and youll keep expanding that way,1,True,-1,turkey,italy,3,49,Spring,1905
i havent agreed a truce with france if england and germany were still attacking france id absolutely be driving on hard why i sent the fleet back for reinforcements but now im torn if i keep hitting france that frees england and germany i guess to push through the last russian centre and come after the three of us from the east rightand pushes france back into their arms how do i avoid that,1,True,1,italy,turkey,3,50,Spring,1905
ah the truth comes out in hindsight i should have realized it was too good to be true,1,True,-1,turkey,italy,3,51,Fall,1905
it was true at the time i said it was but yes negotiations went on,1,True,1,italy,turkey,3,52,Fall,1905
its important to me that you do understand the situation changed there   with both you and austria advising the a greece wasnt needed there my fleet came over for exactly the reason i suggested but then after it arrived i had my french reevaluation and now germany has jumped austria and my ally seems to have lost his conviction about killing you and so  why i am reevaluating again,1,True,2,italy,turkey,3,53,Winter,1905
well at this point the only thing i could offer you as an ally is help in taking dots from austria if thats something youd be more interested in than taking dots from me then we could work together,1,True,-2,turkey,italy,3,54,Winter,1905
on my way to bed let me look at this and come back to you in the morning i think there is a definite chance and if we do this i‚Äôll be perfectly straight with you before we start and likewise if i decide to keep fighting you  this will only work if we surprise him though üòÉ,1,True,2,italy,turkey,3,55,Spring,1906
sorry i ended up being basically offline all day and im involved in a new tournament so busy setting up those games   yes im more interested in taking dots from austria at this point than i am in taking them from you if we schedule a bounce in smyrna in the spring could i count on your support into bulgaria in the fall,1,True,2,italy,turkey,3,56,Spring,1906
hmm long term i‚Äôd sooner have rum and bul for myself while you take the western holdingscould we either agree to some temporary arrangement or could i promise you support into serbia instead,1,True,-2,turkey,italy,3,57,Spring,1906
that makes perfect sense to me i was thinking in terms of what you could support me into but if i can get that build this fall i‚Äôm happy to leave it and let you take it for the following year  and rum too   black sea territories are much easier for you to hold and i need you strong if we‚Äôre going to drive north together,1,True,2,italy,turkey,3,58,Spring,1906
okay glad we‚Äôre on the same page   have you heard anything from austriagermany that might affect how we should proceed austria claims to want to leave ukraine open for me this season though i‚Äôm not sure whether to trust it,1,True,-2,turkey,italy,3,59,Spring,1906
austria is starting to get nerves about all my units heading this way but i‚Äôm reminding him this was part of our plan to kill you currently i‚Äôm offering to help austria defend against germany where he‚Äôs badly out of position,1,True,2,italy,turkey,3,60,Spring,1906
so am i assisting greece into bul this season,1,True,-2,turkey,italy,3,61,Fall,1906
im also wondering if youre going to follow through on your promised assist of austria into vienna i think if were going to stab its better for you not to and to fall back to venice instead,1,True,-2,turkey,italy,3,62,Fall,1906
that‚Äôs up to you friend normally when i stab i prefer to stab hard but if you‚Äôre having concerns and warning austria about our plans then they weren‚Äôt likely to work anyway   how do you want to do this committed stab and pivot north or revert to our prior alliances and see if austria is willing to commit to a direction  any direction  that i can support him to  you know my preference but i don‚Äôt want to push you into something you‚Äôre uncomfortable with,1,True,2,italy,turkey,3,63,Fall,1906
i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve said anything to austria to indicate our collaboration although austria is suspicious anyway all i did this season was ask whether you two were collaborating to which austria said basically ‚Äúi sure hope so but we‚Äôll see‚Äù    i‚Äôm wholly comfortable with going forward with you on a decisive attack on austria,1,True,-2,turkey,italy,3,64,Fall,1906
okay im committed lets do this decisive attack on austria with your supporting me into bulgaria from greece this season and my getting out of the way for you to take bulgaria yourself in the new year well work out how we break rum but if the best solution is me moving into it then well work out a schedule for me to get out of it too  black sea coastal territories are yours  agreed,1,True,2,italy,turkey,3,65,Fall,1906
agreed i‚Äôve placed your support order,1,True,-2,turkey,italy,3,66,Fall,1906
its been a long weekend getting back into the dip mindset do you think you can trust england to keep off your north  if so lets look at getting you rum and bul this year,1,True,4,italy,turkey,3,67,Spring,1907
i think that‚Äôs a good plan are you willing to leave bul this fall,1,True,-4,turkey,italy,3,68,Spring,1907
done taking rumania in the spring,1,True,4,italy,turkey,3,69,Spring,1907
if possible yes,1,True,-4,turkey,italy,3,70,Spring,1907
i‚Äôd also love it if you could move your fleet out of the aegean and into greece or something just to take a little presssure off me,1,True,-4,turkey,italy,3,71,Spring,1907
thats fine im using it to cover greece this season  aegean dmz,1,True,4,italy,turkey,3,72,Spring,1907
agreed üôÇ,1,True,-4,turkey,italy,3,73,Spring,1907
austria has asked me to support them into bul this season since youre giving it up to me anyway and it will be useful to us to have their trust should i do it,1,True,-4,turkey,italy,3,74,Spring,1907
oh dear im sorry it looks like to you didnt get my message let me know if theres some way i can make it up to you,1,False,-4,turkey,italy,3,75,Spring,1907
ouch unfortunately you‚Äôre right i wasn‚Äôt around for your first message at 110 am and so wasn‚Äôt in a position to suggest anything else what does their trust buy us other than forcing a disband of one of our units due to complete the defeat of our mutual enemy this turn,1,True,4,italy,turkey,3,76,Spring,1907
im really sorry i forgot that youre not in a us timezone i didnt realize it would be such an issue because to me it just made sense that youd move into serbia with bulgaria and support from albania so that support couldnt be cut by rum,1,False,-4,turkey,italy,3,77,Spring,1907
and that trust gets us information like for instance i could have told you not to move with albania if it werent for our time difference issue i really am sorry and ill be more aware of it in the future,1,True,-4,turkey,italy,3,78,Spring,1907
ah no i knew you were attacking rumania this turn so i waited in bulgaria to ensure he couldn‚Äôt simply retreat in there and offer you the same problem all over again in fall the move out was due in fall yes into ser so that you could reclaim your rightful black sea borders as scheduled üòÉ,1,True,4,italy,turkey,3,79,Spring,1907
not sure i have the armies to do that now i‚Äôll look at the map when i‚Äôm more awake but may need you to take a more proactive role if that‚Äôs okay,1,True,4,italy,turkey,3,80,Spring,1907
im already on it ill get back to you in a couple hours,1,True,-4,turkey,italy,3,81,Spring,1907
so con to bul ec i can support you there from gre and if you support from rum as well should get you back where you should be,1,True,4,italy,turkey,3,82,Fall,1907
ill do that but just so you know austria told me they were going for greece this turn,1,True,-4,turkey,italy,3,83,Fall,1907
from where,1,True,4,italy,turkey,3,84,Fall,1907
bulgaria,1,True,-4,turkey,italy,3,85,Fall,1907
not a problem then  provided you hit bul with con supported from rum,1,True,4,italy,turkey,3,86,Fall,1907
okay great,1,True,-4,turkey,italy,3,87,Fall,1907
that went more or less according to plan thanks for your support,1,True,3,italy,turkey,3,88,Winter,1907
i want you to know that despite my move to sc instead of ec i plan to honor the dmz of the aegean i was just being overcautious in case you decided not to honor it,1,False,-3,turkey,italy,3,89,Winter,1907
should we look into spring then what are you trying to achieve this year,1,True,3,italy,turkey,3,90,Winter,1907
i was just asking myself that expanding northwards against germanyengland seems logical for me,1,False,-3,turkey,italy,3,91,Winter,1907
what are your goals,1,True,-3,turkey,italy,3,92,Winter,1907
since austria is a little more back in the game than i‚Äôd planned they have to be my focus after that i fully intend to stick with my alliance and drive to the final endgame 3,1,True,3,italy,turkey,3,93,Winter,1907
just not looking at those moves yet,1,True,3,italy,turkey,3,94,Winter,1907
hi there we should talk ive communicated with germany at this point and ive heard from england and keen to hear your strategic thoughts on the overall picture where can we draw a line of dmzs where if anywhere can we work together more proactively its reaching a bit but if i ever have a spare fleet would it be useful as a loaner to your lineup in the north,1,True,0,italy,france,3,0,Spring,1901
hey hey,1,True,0,france,italy,3,1,Spring,1901
to be honest just got done with a day from hell so not really thinking big picture at the moment yet  placeholder orders are more or less just a standard french opening just starting to touch base with all the neighbors,1,True,0,france,italy,3,2,Spring,1901
i read you france and sorry to hear about the apocalypse on earth pretty standard italian opening as well im neither more nervous or less of my neighbours than usual   once you get your press off maybe lie down and listen to your favourite tunes i know that helps me when im blue,1,True,0,italy,france,3,3,Spring,1901
oh im not blue  just worn out  its been a hectic week  i think ill stick close to a standard opening get in position to drop a bunch of fleets,1,True,0,france,italy,3,4,Spring,1901
sounds good off brest please  seeing them appear in marseilles will set off all sorts of alarms in la bella italia  i‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre ‚Äúonly‚Äù very tired what is it you do when you‚Äôre not governing the fates of a nation  engineering student here,1,True,0,italy,france,3,5,Spring,1901
i design software systems for electronic health records,1,True,0,france,italy,3,6,Spring,1901
whats your focus  i was originally an electrical engineering student myself,1,True,0,france,italy,3,7,Spring,1901
aerospace engineering 3 i finish my course at the end of next year and then have to actually find work if i can i enjoy the university but dont want to spend my whole life in academia you know,1,True,0,italy,france,3,8,Spring,1901
no no you probably do not want to do that  üòÉ,1,True,0,france,italy,3,9,Spring,1901
nothing too new this turn good to see youre on good terms with your neighbours  or at least good enough to quickly grab your neutrals this year,1,True,0,italy,france,3,10,Fall,1901
we should probably talk dmzs then yeah i dont have any intention of going into piedmont any time soon and really do either us want to see any naval adventures in the gulf of lyon the western med or north africa,1,True,0,italy,france,3,11,Fall,1901
thats the plan  and yes it would be very nice to keep the western med area free of fleets,1,True,0,france,italy,3,12,Fall,1901
anything i should be worried about there england and germany seem to be coordinating well but at least theyre leaving your borders well alone do we have dmzs in every territory i mentioned or only the western med,1,True,-1,italy,france,3,13,Winter,1901
we do and we should be good i imagine there will be fallout to deal with from the attempt at munich,0,True,1,france,italy,3,14,Winter,1901
touching base anything new from our friends to the west and where is the army in marseilles headed we italians are known for our warm and personal hospitality but prefer t,1,True,-1,italy,france,3,15,Spring,1902
to extend that on a more individual basis than to whole armies at a time,1,True,-1,italy,france,3,16,Spring,1902
ouch that hurt though as you see we did spot you coming are you still intent on trying to force your way past my defense or are you ready to talk ,1,True,-1,italy,france,3,17,Fall,1902
always ready to talk  driving now though  be a couple hours before i can pull up the map,1,True,1,france,italy,3,18,Fall,1902
now that im home we could probably work out a set of moves that keeps me in position to move elsewhere next turn,1,False,1,france,italy,3,19,Fall,1902
keeps me in position and moving elsewhere do feel a little contradictory i have to say still if we can avoid butting heads pointlessly for the next three years im all ears   where else did you have in mind your german and english borders seem a little bare so i trust there are diplomatic ties keeping them safe and secure,1,True,-1,italy,france,3,20,Fall,1902
thats the theory and you missed the time component keeping me in place this turn so i can move the other direction next turn which is harder to do if i advance this turn,1,True,1,france,italy,3,21,Fall,1902
youre not going to advance this turn i appreciate the thought but im already there and have nothing pulling me away in another direction   or was that your point,1,True,-1,italy,france,3,22,Fall,1902
more or less  but we need to make sure i dont advance  i mean you cant effectively cover all of north africa western med tuscany and tyrolia hence the getting on the same page üôÇ,1,True,1,france,italy,3,23,Fall,1902
and thats what i was talking about  keeping me in mao would have made it easier to flip in the spring,1,False,1,france,italy,3,24,Fall,1902
ok that works looks like some chaos between england and germany we can maybe use to disentangle,1,True,0,france,italy,3,25,Spring,1903
i think england is being very clever and is using russias ambitious early play to get an advantage while you and germany are committed but then hes the same player who warned me about an incoming western triple a few seasons ago so   how would you like us to disengage planning on just turning around and going home or something more dynamic,1,True,0,italy,france,3,26,Spring,1903
good question stand by while i get a feel for whats going on with the rest of the board how secure are you feeling with the austrian,1,True,0,france,italy,3,27,Spring,1903
reasonably secure hes in tyrolia because i asked him to come if thats what you mean 3,1,True,0,italy,france,3,28,Spring,1903
it is yes and funny enough my full push on italy order set last turn would have had me ordered there but i was trying not to push too hard  i think im inclined to mostly just straight up go away just putting one unsupported move to tyrrhenian to keep you from fullpressing a followup  does that work for you  that would let you either force your way in and still put one on ionian or force ionian and just use one to keep tyrrhenian empty,1,False,0,france,italy,3,29,Spring,1903
it does in principle yes it‚Äôs after midnight here and i‚Äôm heading to bed but i‚Äôll have a closer look at the map tomorrow today now and give you a fuller response then maybe we can plot out some actual moves then where was the one unsupported move coming from so i can run a sandbox tomorrow over coffee,1,True,0,italy,france,3,30,Spring,1903
that would be lyons i was going to stay something cheeky but its actually pretty obvious which one id want to back up and which is want to hold as a delay,1,False,0,france,italy,3,31,Spring,1903
ugh autocorrect making it look like ive had a stroke,1,True,0,france,italy,3,32,Spring,1903
so not quite what you said you were going to do   i didnt mind disposing of the offending unit in piedmont though so you wont have to have him courtmartialed i half expected a convoy into north africa though i now see you have larger threats to worry about to your north russia coordinating with a powerful england and england and germany descending on your open borders,1,True,0,italy,france,3,33,Fall,1903
eh  i did exactly what i said i was doing  but yes you can clearly see that not only was i already backing away from you im now highly motivated to fully commit to that,1,True,0,france,italy,3,34,Fall,1903
the attack on tyrolia wasnt precisely the same thing of im pulling back as i expected but ill give you the benefit of the doubt i guess im not really sure what you were trying to do there honestly unless you were hoping to menace munich from the south,1,True,0,italy,france,3,35,Fall,1903
sigh alright then spain wont be supporting marseille so you dont need to cut it youd just be helping england by doing so and screw him so if you want you definitely have the option of shifting wmed  naftys  wmed that would let you take marseille and be in position to still take spain in the fall andor contest the midatlantic,1,True,0,france,italy,3,36,Winter,1903
agggh i must have been half asleep i didnt hit the thumb or that was when the bot was down,1,True,0,italy,france,3,37,Winter,1903
let me look at this and work out what were doing,1,True,0,italy,france,3,38,Winter,1903
i was indeed hoping to menace munich  for this turn im also willing to support wmed  mao,1,True,0,france,italy,3,39,Winter,1903
im generally in favour of that idea where is mao going,1,True,0,italy,france,3,40,Winter,1903
i am generally in favour of plan screw him i have a few reasons and in hindsight i can see the strings tied to my shoulders from a few seasons back would i be fair in assuming he set you to fighting me at about the same time he warned me you were coming,1,True,0,italy,france,3,41,Winter,1903
so confirming youd like me to move f wmed  mao in spring and will support me there from spain if i dont cut you that season if i can get marseilles spain and ultimately portugal i would be overjoyed though i confess i dont completely understand why youre helping me do this   i think i need to understand,1,True,0,italy,france,3,42,Winter,1903
yes hes been pulling some strings as to why  with three on my doorstep im going to lose dots all things being equal id rather they go to the person that didnt betray me  as for mao its going to english that may cut a support and youll just bounce mao open it may also walk in behind a moving english fleet and get you into mao hard to say but either is better for you than letting an english fleet in üòÄ,1,True,0,france,italy,3,43,Winter,1903
i agree and well reasoned i‚Äôll keep your secrets although he does have a knack for reading the board and plan closely with you for next year‚Äôs moves,1,True,0,italy,france,3,44,Winter,1903
supports in the box  do with that what ye will,1,True,0,france,italy,3,45,Spring,1904
thank you i‚Äôll see to it that it‚Äôs not wasted,1,True,0,italy,france,3,46,Spring,1904
so were changing back again then   i dont object to someone defending themselves but you could have said something üòÇ i havent lied to you yet and dont intend on starting now,1,True,2,italy,france,3,47,Winter,1904
sonafabitch  did i forget to hit thumbsup on the last message  yeah i did not mean for that to be a surprise to you and im deeply sorry cause you did me a solid and it looks like i reacted by being a dick,0,True,-2,france,italy,3,48,Winter,1904
so the triple is back on i see england has decided he can afford to kill russia now though he hasn‚Äôt asked me to distract turkey recently,1,True,2,italy,france,3,49,Winter,1904
nope hes killed the triple idea for me so what pull would make you happy,1,True,-2,france,italy,3,50,Winter,1904
what is a pull im sorry getting asked a lot about terms i dont recognise in this game,1,True,2,italy,france,3,51,Winter,1904
oh you mean pull off the board,1,True,2,italy,france,3,52,Winter,1904
i dont see any reason youd be inclined to make me too happy if i was still trying to kill you but since im apparently the only one doing that last turn i dont feel any particular obligation to stick with that plan either   if you remove an army id be happy to see that as a sign of good will  i do want to keep my build but get that you wouldnt want to lose a home centre long term  right   simplest answer if i go back east is to sit an army in marseilles while everyone else leaves and lets you focus north   next simplest is a mar moving to spain i guess and letting you reclaim mar uncontested  or we could do something more aggressive but without me in your backyard im sure you could make some progress against england if thats who youre looking at,1,True,2,italy,france,3,53,Winter,1904
you sum it up well army gascony is probably the overall friendliest yet most ambiguous pull it takes pressure off marseille but would let me keep pressing england if you backed off and im happy to leave marseille italian for a while if the issue is off me  dont especially need that as a build spot in the near term,1,True,-2,france,italy,3,54,Winter,1904
we should talk about how we‚Äôre going to disengage so there‚Äôs no confusion and no temptation to warn anyone what we‚Äôve got planned for them ,1,True,2,italy,france,3,55,Spring,1905
i‚Äôm trusting your fleets are headed north and i‚Äôm sending everything other than a mar and f gol this turn east i hope to send f gol east next season as well,1,True,2,italy,france,3,56,Spring,1905
were really on incompatible time schedules  fleets are headed north so is burgundy,1,True,-2,france,italy,3,57,Spring,1905
you may want to cover spain,1,True,-4,france,italy,3,58,Spring,1907
cover or try to take it,1,True,4,italy,france,3,59,Spring,1907
same thing mate its all yours as far as im concerned üòÄ,1,True,-4,france,italy,3,60,Spring,1907
alright will do my best,1,True,4,italy,france,3,61,Spring,1907
hey austria how are things in the east,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,0,Spring,1901
things are good down here we should watch each others backs being from the same stock and all we have to be careful being in the middle of someone elses conflict,1,False,0,austria,germany,3,1,Spring,1901
yes yes i agree,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,2,Spring,1901
i think any conflict between us will only result in one of us losing followed quickly by the other losing  so should we have some sort of nonaggression pact,1,,0,austria,germany,3,3,Spring,1901
yes that would be bad for both of us,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,4,Spring,1901
how are you feeling about italy,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,5,Spring,1901
seems to be working with me on getting some intel im curious about your feelings on russia,1,,0,austria,germany,3,6,Spring,1901
have you heard anything from turkey,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,7,Fall,1901
it seems like russia is aiming for him,0,True,0,germany,austria,3,8,Fall,1901
yeah it would seem that way but turkey told me that russia was not conspiring against him,1,True,0,austria,germany,3,9,Fall,1901
interested in taking out russia,1,True,-1,austria,germany,3,10,Fall,1902
always,1,True,1,germany,austria,3,11,Fall,1902
do you have any plans for the fall i am up for continuing our nonaggression pact this season hopefully we can work together to take out russia in central europe,1,True,1,germany,austria,3,12,Fall,1902
not yet talking to people to see if they may want to make moves on russia,1,True,-1,austria,germany,3,13,Fall,1902
are you cool with me moving into boh im still agreeable to a nonaggression pact just would like to be more useful against russia,1,True,1,germany,austria,3,14,Fall,1902
sure that sounds reasonable,1,,-1,austria,germany,3,15,Fall,1902
moving to tyr to help italy would appreciate you not taking my open vienna,1,True,-1,austria,germany,3,16,Fall,1902
yep can do that have you talked to france about tyr not sure his exact plans but you two should be able to take on italy if you coordinate,1,True,1,germany,austria,3,17,Fall,1902
im trying to help italy at least until russia is gone i figure we have to take out one of the countries on the outside before worrying about other countries in the central,1,True,-1,austria,germany,3,18,Fall,1902
ok sounds good,1,True,1,germany,austria,3,19,Fall,1902
are you working with france to take out england or just in a nonaggression against them,1,True,-1,austria,germany,3,20,Fall,1902
non aggression,1,True,1,germany,austria,3,21,Fall,1902
cool cool cool,1,True,-1,austria,germany,3,22,Fall,1902
can you tell what‚Äôs going on with turkey,1,True,1,germany,austria,3,23,Fall,1902
theyre suspicious of an alliance between you england and france which seems at least part true if theyre ready im going to try to push into russia with them italy is watching my back and i have a nonaggression with you so im going to leave myself pretty vulnerable,1,True,-1,austria,germany,3,24,Fall,1902
ok my main focus right now is russia too if you me and turkey can coordinate against russia we should be able to get him off our backs quickly,1,True,1,germany,austria,3,25,Fall,1902
im going to suggest me supporting turkey into rum and the my moving my army in bud to gal to pressure war,1,True,-1,austria,germany,3,26,Fall,1902
sounds good to me,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,27,Spring,1903
want to move your army into boh to help me in case russia gets feisty trying to make moves to take them out,1,False,0,austria,germany,3,28,Spring,1903
what are your plans with your army in tyr,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,29,Spring,1903
helping italy with piedmont youre probably fine leaving your army where it is actually would you help me if russia tries to move into my territory though,1,,0,austria,germany,3,30,Spring,1903
ok cool yeah if we are able to ward off russia successfully we can figure out a plan to split his supply centers fairly between us,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,31,Spring,1903
are you moving against england,1,True,0,austria,germany,3,32,Winter,1903
trying to,0,True,0,germany,austria,3,33,Winter,1903
cool i moved my unit into vie so i cant build one this winter im hoping to push at russia either gal or war just wanted to let you know when i start moving,1,,0,austria,germany,3,34,Winter,1903
after russia is taken out are you planning on going after england,1,True,0,austria,germany,3,35,Fall,1904
and if so do you want to let me take war and ill help you take stp and make moves into swe,1,False,0,austria,germany,3,36,Fall,1904
the problem is that after russia is out all of us in the west will have to start worrying about turkey,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,37,Fall,1904
have you been able to make any plans with turkey against russia,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,38,Fall,1904
going to support their push into ukr,1,True,0,austria,germany,3,39,Fall,1904
if you support me into war ill help you take stp and can help later deal with england,1,True,0,austria,germany,3,40,Fall,1904
would you be open to supporting me into war and then ill support you into moscowdown into turkey,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,41,Fall,1904
i could be what are your plans with england once russia is gone it seems it would be more beneficial to have stp and take over scandanavia but obviously we would both want war given its location to us,1,True,0,austria,germany,3,42,Fall,1904
just wanted to know what you see your self doing in the next couple turns,1,True,0,austria,germany,3,43,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm trying to work with england as long as possiblei‚Äôm hesitant to make  promises or plans based on stp because i‚Äôm using it at a bargaining chip for the long game,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,44,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm hoping to get france or italy out next,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,45,Fall,1904
and use england to do so,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,46,Fall,1904
are you still focused east or do you plan on moving into italy,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,47,Fall,1904
so be it ill support you into war  id prefer getting rid of france since italy has worked really well with me id suggest knocking out france then going after england,1,True,0,austria,germany,3,48,Fall,1904
well italy is watching my back against turkey so i dont really want to fight them so more focused on the east,1,True,0,austria,germany,3,49,Fall,1904
ok thanks i owe you,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,50,Fall,1904
that makes sense yeah italy has been helpful against france so far hopefully us in the middle can keep working well together,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,51,Fall,1904
i think in the end its either going to be all three of us central countries left or whichever betrays the other two survives the longest before being taken out,1,True,0,austria,germany,3,52,Fall,1904
agree,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,53,Fall,1904
if think you can handle england on the west you could probably book from bal into sweden and then theyre cut off from the east it would make it easier to clean up the eastern stragglers after,1,True,0,austria,germany,3,54,Fall,1904
yes that‚Äôs very tempting,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,55,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm still waiting to hear back from england before making any aggressive moves at this point i need france to be weaker before having england completely after me i don‚Äôt think i could manage both of them haha,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,56,Fall,1904
forgot you still have some border with england,1,True,0,austria,germany,3,57,Fall,1904
yes unfortunately,1,True,0,germany,austria,3,58,Fall,1904
thank you for following through with support,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,59,Spring,1905
russia is basically done i think we need to start being concerned with turkey and try to prevent him from creeping into russias supply centers,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,60,Spring,1905
of course,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,61,Spring,1905
i agree but i think we need to worry about england as well i think the easiest way to split it would be for me to take mos and you stp italy and i surround turkey and then you contain england until france is gone then england is the focus,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,62,Spring,1905
i can move gal into ukr and bud into gal to gather forces to oppose turkey,1,,-2,austria,germany,3,63,Spring,1905
what does england think about you taking swe was that planned or are you taking them on now,1,,-2,austria,germany,3,64,Spring,1905
yes swe was planned,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,65,Spring,1905
okay,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,66,Spring,1905
i have gotten england to agree to stop traveling south of stp in russia who knows how long that will actually last but i think its safe to assume he wont be interfering in russia too much for another season or two,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,67,Spring,1905
basically it seems like england is waiting for you and italy to put a decent dent into turkey before making any huge moves east so youwe have time to nibble out turkey and build up in the meantime,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,68,Spring,1905
well if we start making moves on turkey would you be comfortable moving your army up to take stp it would certainly be a whole lot less stress having england not trying to mess with the east,1,,-2,austria,germany,3,69,Spring,1905
it seems like russia is going to support either england or turkey into moscow this season to leave the game with whoever his preference is at that supply center just wont be me haha  would you feel ok moving an army to uk r to support me into moscow then i can support you into sev or let you have warsaw and between moscow and an army im moving up north this season i can keep england at bay,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,70,Spring,1905
yes i can work with that,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,71,Spring,1905
sorry if it seems like some messages sent out of order i realized id forgotten some bot thumbs,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,72,Spring,1905
just finally talked to turkey haha i think they are moving into ukr this turn so maybe you should at least block them from moving inland that way,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,73,Spring,1905
can you support me into moscow like we talked about before then i can keep england out of our hairfinish off russia,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,74,Fall,1905
youve got my support into moscow,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,75,Fall,1905
awesome thank you,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,76,Fall,1905
thats funny you didnt happen to mention your aggression into vie in your previous messages,1,,-2,austria,germany,3,77,Winter,1905
i‚Äôm very sorry i didn‚Äôt want to üò¶   england has been threatening me and it was the only option i had to stay even with him without inciting his wrath,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,78,Winter,1905
england just asked me if vie was staged so either youre lying or theyre trying to foment anger,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,79,Winter,1905
he is very good at mind games i know there‚Äôs no way to prove it but i‚Äôm not lyinghaven‚Äôt lied to you,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,80,Winter,1905
thats all well and good but how does it stop your aggression towards me i need some sort of recompense or i wont be able to trust you,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,81,Winter,1905
i understand what do you propose,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,82,Spring,1906
you leaving my territory,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,83,Spring,1906
turkey is upset with my betrayal so now i have everyone to contend with,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,84,Spring,1906
have you been conspiring with italy against me because theyre moving all their units west,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,85,Spring,1906
no i havent been conspiring with italy my understanding was that italy was prepared to support you into turkey,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,86,Spring,1906
if you really do want to have this central alliance then i think it should be fair for me to have my territory back you dont have to just give it back i can have my units take it  back in force so it looks like we are fighting although i do think you should start to deal with england considering how large they  are becoming,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,87,Spring,1906
the problem now is that if you use units to regain vie youll just create an aisle for turkey to waltz into central europe do you have any plans in place to stop him seems like you two had some sort of nonaggression agreement last season,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,88,Fall,1906
well i was exactly thrilled with the possibility of a western threat so i let them take ukr to keep them from being too aggressive,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,89,Fall,1906
wasnt,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,90,Fall,1906
also england is about to move up to 8 units if you move up right after russias last army disbands then you can easily take swe and stp then italy and i will be able to deal with turkey,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,91,Fall,1906
ah makes sense yeah england is growing quickly i‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to settle things with france and england on my western border first and then figure out the best way forward from there i think england and turkey will be tied up with each other to our east for a season or two which buys us some time,0,True,2,germany,austria,3,92,Fall,1906
so are you fine with me attacking vie to keep up appearances,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,93,Fall,1906
i mean no not happy about it haha but seems like my only option at the moment,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,94,Fall,1906
i wasnt happy about you taking it to begin with but at least im telling you now,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,95,Fall,1906
haha fair enough,1,True,2,germany,austria,3,96,Fall,1906
you both betrayed me first but dont think youll last much longer when all is said and done,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,97,Fall,1906
betrayer queen would you like to assist me with hurting italy in exchange for my territory they betrayed me harder so i want them to suffer the most,1,True,-2,austria,germany,3,98,Fall,1906
yes i‚Äôm open to us discussing an agreement what do you propose,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,99,Winter,1906
i lose but italy loses territory in the process,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,100,Winter,1906
i want to see the streets run red with their ragu,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,101,Winter,1906
their color is green so it would actually be pesto,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,102,Winter,1906
i want to see the streets run with a liquid theyre known for,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,103,Winter,1906
are you in,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,104,Winter,1906
yes,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,105,Winter,1906
not that it will change my current state of survival but youre not going to betray me as well right,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,106,Winter,1906
i mean again,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,107,Winter,1906
i don‚Äôt want to be too outright in an attack against italy because i will likely need their support in france soon and i need to keep developing a good relationship with turkey before italy retaliates against me,1,False,3,germany,austria,3,108,Winter,1906
but yes i‚Äôm in,1,False,3,germany,austria,3,109,Winter,1906
did you have any specific ideas for this season i think i‚Äôll need boh to support munich and i‚Äôm concerned about losing war,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,110,Spring,1907
destruction of the traitor italy,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,111,Spring,1907
i promise you that if you move boh to tyr i can follow up next season with a push into ven,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,112,Spring,1907
i can‚Äôt move boh this season bc i need it to defend munich against france,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,113,Spring,1907
move boh to tyr im going to try to take tri then i can support you into italy my back is completely open so you dont have to worry about me stabbing you,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,114,Spring,1907
also pretty sure turkey is chumped out and is going to let italy try to roll over me which is obviously super cool for me just a heads up for when im gone,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,115,Spring,1907
like i said i can‚Äôt move boh this season because i can‚Äôt afford to leave munich undefended and i need to move kie back into holland going to try to move my northern units south i guess,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,116,Spring,1907
okay will you at least lie for me and say something about how im going for tyr or something so that i can try to push back on italy a bit,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,117,Spring,1907
sure thing,0,True,3,germany,austria,3,118,Spring,1907
what are you planning on doing with your vie unit this season,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,119,Fall,1907
move for tri id like for you to move into tyr so we can push into italy then you can take vie after,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,120,Fall,1907
or possibly take back bud if you could find it in your heart to not stab me again for a season or two,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,121,Fall,1907
problem is that if i don‚Äôt get another build this winter idk if i can keep pace with italy next year üò¶,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,122,Fall,1907
well if things go accordingly then italy should be losing two builds this season,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,123,Fall,1907
any reason why youre not just taking nwy,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,124,Fall,1907
england and i are balanced and staying out of each other‚Äôs way he‚Äôs respected my home territories thus far bc i haven‚Äôt gone after him norway will be an easy grab for me when the time comes no need to rock that boat quite yet,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,125,Fall,1907
well i guess weve seen that strategy certainly works,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,126,Fall,1907
don‚Äôt want him convincing france to take me on,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,127,Fall,1907
im going to try to convince france to move against italy you should to,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,128,Fall,1907
whats your plan this round,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,129,Fall,1907
mostly defense trying to move farther into central europe,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,130,Fall,1907
so towards me,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,131,Fall,1907
gal it‚Äôll give me more options for next round maybe take bud back from italy or rum,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,132,Fall,1907
okay that was just a very vague statement had me a bit confused maybe move boh tyr then i can either support you into tri or vice versa,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,133,Fall,1907
then you can move down after italy is out,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,134,Fall,1907
also you should really convince france to help out against italy while they can still take advantage of it otherwise italy is going to walk into france and get a bunch more production,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,135,Fall,1907
i can‚Äôt move into tyr this season i need that unit to support mun,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,136,Fall,1907
didnt france just attack england right there,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,137,Fall,1907
yeah but france was working with england just one season before and he won‚Äôt talk to me,0,True,3,germany,austria,3,138,Fall,1907
from the looks of last season it would seem they had a italy betrayal moment,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,139,Fall,1907
who knows,0,True,3,germany,austria,3,140,Fall,1907
this game is rife with backstabbring if only we could have all been friends,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,141,Fall,1907
im obviously fairly heavily committed to my attack on you at the moment but i do consider turkeys shenanigans around bulgaria a breach so before i forgive and forget i thought id offer you a chance to negotiate ,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,142,Fall,1907
are you going to,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,143,Fall,1907
backstabbr you no ive told you italy and turkey my objective the complete destruction of italy,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,144,Fall,1907
at least italy is warned haha,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,145,Fall,1907
im more a frontstabbr type of person,1,True,-3,austria,germany,3,146,Fall,1907
you should buy up that domain name,1,True,3,germany,austria,3,147,Fall,1907
you should really start attacking italy youre just going to get surrounded if you dont start doing something now,1,,-3,austria,germany,3,148,Fall,1907
not trying to tell you how to play but if you dont move into boh soon youre going to lose the opportunity and italy is going to take control,1,,-5,austria,germany,3,149,Winter,1907
would you mind supporting me into bud this next season so i can  make another unit to push at italy,1,,-5,austria,germany,3,150,Winter,1907
so im proposing a northern triple you me and england roll down the rest of the board and then call a threeway draw its a good route because its a pretty stealthy alliance early on it looks like an eg taking on france and russia just acting normally how does that sound to you,1,True,1,russia,germany,3,0,Spring,1901
hey that sounds like a good route im up for it,1,True,-1,germany,russia,3,1,Spring,1901
have you talked to england about it yet,1,True,-1,germany,russia,3,2,Spring,1901
englands on board as far as i can tell,1,True,1,russia,germany,3,3,Spring,1901
awesome i talked to them about being on board too,1,True,-1,germany,russia,3,4,Spring,1901
what are you thinking for your initial moves,1,True,-1,germany,russia,3,5,Spring,1901
so you decided to opt for a western triple instead of a northern i admit i take some fault here because i let my daytoday business get in the way of keeping up with messaging here but you do know that western triples never go well for germany right if you stick with it youre gonna be surrounded by a greedy england who will be able to grind you into dust,1,True,0,russia,germany,3,6,Fall,1902
hi kaiser greetings from her majesty the queen ive been ordered to deliver this message to you in hopes of establishing an alliance  i wanted first to try a western triple with france and wrote to him accordingly however russia has proposed a northern triple seeing as you are my first choice in alliance im good with which ever you would like to try hope to hear from you soon,1,True,0,england,germany,3,0,Spring,1901
hi queen greetings from germany the kaserin actually üòâ ,1,,0,germany,england,3,1,Spring,1901

i havent tried it or seen it,1,True,0,england,germany,3,3,Spring,1901

a very romantic plan i love it and am totally in,1,False,0,england,germany,3,14,Spring,1901
hello my queen would you possibly have any info on france for me,1,True,0,england,germany,3,15,Spring,1901

i want to secure nwy for sure and am hoping that i could get bel,1,True,0,england,germany,3,19,Spring,1901
if france is on board with the western tripple he may be on with me having bel and then after that you my queen and i would have to decide which tripple we want to stay with,1,True,0,england,germany,3,20,Spring,1901

i am planning to move to den and ruh does that sound ok to you,1,True,0,germany,england,3,24,Spring,1901
absolutely my beautiful queen,1,False,0,england,germany,3,25,Spring,1901
as for france not much of a talker so hard to judge honestly,1,,0,england,germany,3,26,Fall,1901
yeah i cant super tell they just said they were opening south which they did,1,True,0,germany,england,3,27,Fall,1901
what are you thinking for fall orders,1,True,0,germany,england,3,28,Fall,1901
russia seems sketchy not sure if they are committed to the triple,1,True,0,germany,england,3,29,Fall,1901
see ive got the same inkling about russia being twofaced with us,1,True,0,england,germany,3,30,Fall,1901
yeah hopefully russia will focus on taking out austria and turkey but who knows,1,True,0,germany,england,3,31,Fall,1901
so apparently russia has offered alliance to basically every nation lol,1,True,0,england,germany,3,32,Fall,1901
i am more than ever by your side my queen,1,True,0,england,germany,3,33,Fall,1901
france is more promising for triple alliance,1,True,0,england,germany,3,34,Fall,1901
i will convoy my army to nwy if you bounce russia in swe and we will be well on our way to eliminating him  nobody likes an alliance whore right,1,True,0,england,germany,3,35,Fall,1901
i agree dont think we can trust russia and it seems like everyone else realizes that too at this point,1,True,0,germany,england,3,36,Fall,1901
yes those moves sound good to me,1,True,0,germany,england,3,37,Fall,1901
what do you think we should do re france he proposed bouncing over munich,1,True,0,germany,england,3,38,Fall,1901
i think thats a clever idea,1,True,0,england,germany,3,39,Fall,1901
keeps the other nations in the dark about our tripple alliance with him,1,True,0,england,germany,3,40,Fall,1901
especially for italy,1,True,0,england,germany,3,41,Fall,1901
sounds good ill let him know,1,True,0,germany,england,3,42,Fall,1901
beautiful moves my queen im in love üòç,1,False,0,england,germany,3,43,Winter,1901
i propose we demilitarize any and all neighboring territories between france you and me i will relay this same message to france and if youre agreed to it relay it to france as well and we have him relay it back to us i wish we could have a 3way chat with him,1,True,0,england,germany,3,44,Winter,1901
i propose we demilitarize any and all neighboring territories between france you and me i will relay this same message to france and if youre agreed to it relay it to france as well and we have him relay it back to us i wish we could have a 3way chat with him,1,True,0,england,germany,3,45,Winter,1901
the demilitarization would basically consist of pic bur bel hol and ruh oh and nth for me as well seeing as it is adjacent hol,1,True,0,england,germany,3,46,Winter,1901
that being said i suggest we wait till fall  to act on it so as to keep our triple alliance under wraps for as long as possible but i do like to operate on complete trust in order to more efficiently and effectively use our units in our respective theatres,1,True,0,england,germany,3,47,Winter,1901
i anticipate very much to hear your response   im gonna finish building this little building and get me some much needed sleep and dream about your reply hehe,1,True,0,england,germany,3,48,Winter,1901
yes that works for me ill relay to france and get back to you let me know what you hear back from france,1,True,0,germany,england,3,49,Winter,1901
ok france got back with me  said hes good with it too,1,True,0,england,germany,3,50,Winter,1901
yes he said the same to me i think we should work towards taking out russia in scandinavia,1,True,0,germany,england,3,51,Spring,1902
i agree my queen sorry ive been very limited on time how would you like to play it up in scandi,1,True,0,england,germany,3,52,Spring,1902
this fall i could support you into sweden while you cut bot support and i take stp,1,True,0,england,germany,3,53,Spring,1902
then well be set to crush him in the mainland i have my orders set for very strong positional gain to be ready for the fall if you bounce swe again and move into bal well bet set for fall also ber is going to nth i dont think i can get online again before resolution so cheers my queen well catch up later,1,True,0,england,germany,3,54,Spring,1902
sounds good to me we will reconvene for fall,1,True,0,germany,england,3,55,Spring,1902
hey kaiserin i figured you would honor our dmz treaty this year what happened,1,True,0,england,germany,3,56,Fall,1902
i am sorry i took it to mean no action in those places and i thought i was already there when we agreed on the zones  please know it was only a misunderstanding üòÉ i still have your back,1,True,0,germany,england,3,57,Fall,1902
did russia confront you about the western triple he‚Äôs on to us,1,True,0,germany,england,3,58,Fall,1902
yes he did lol,1,True,0,england,germany,3,59,Fall,1902
also how do you not know what demilitarization of an area means lol you fairly new at the game or from another planet hehe,1,True,0,england,germany,3,60,Fall,1902
see now you put me in a pickle  thats why i confirmed with you that i was moving out of bel i was expecting hol and ruh to be vacated as well,1,True,0,england,germany,3,61,Fall,1902
although youve given me no reason beyond that for distrust so im staying with you and trusting you my queen   on another note russia is kinda desperate and asking me to head towards france lol even offered me support into sweden,1,True,0,england,germany,3,62,Fall,1902
are you there kaiserin,1,True,0,england,germany,3,63,Fall,1902
gah sorry it really was just an honest brain lapse i was entering moves last minute while occupied in real life thank you for giving me another chance to prove my support,1,True,0,germany,england,3,64,Fall,1902
oh good youre online ,1,True,0,england,germany,3,65,Fall,1902
yes russia seems desperate i think he got everyone against him from the very beginning italy is definitely working to find an alliance against france,1,True,0,germany,england,3,66,Fall,1902
has he made you any offers on sweden,0,True,0,england,germany,3,67,Fall,1902
no specific offers yet but they are definitely trying to scheme something,1,True,0,germany,england,3,68,Fall,1902
i suppose it will be more mediterranean based,1,True,0,germany,england,3,69,Fall,1902
oh no i was referring to russia,1,True,0,england,germany,3,70,Fall,1902
like has he made you an offer on sweden,1,True,0,england,germany,3,71,Fall,1902
ohhh sorry was confused why italy would be taking about swe haha no russia didn‚Äôt offer anything,1,True,0,germany,england,3,72,Fall,1902
he just snarked about me ignoring him and his alliance even though he was silent and uncooperative before,1,True,0,germany,england,3,73,Fall,1902
ok good well could you attack his fleet to cut support so i can get into stp,1,True,0,england,germany,3,74,Fall,1902
yes,1,True,0,germany,england,3,75,Fall,1902
awesome thank you my queen also we need to discuss how were going to split russia turkey will want a piece of him too,1,True,0,england,germany,3,76,Fall,1902
if i may ask where are you from seems so hard to coordinate good time to talk,1,True,0,england,germany,3,77,Fall,1902
sorry i left abruptly earlier had to run out for some appointments can‚Äôt diplomacy and drive üòâ,1,True,0,germany,england,3,78,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm on the east coast,1,True,0,germany,england,3,79,Fall,1902
pa,1,True,0,england,germany,3,80,Fall,1902
yes i agree about figuring a plan to split up russia austria is aiming for russia too so we can probably use him along the way,1,True,0,germany,england,3,81,Fall,1902
currently literally caught in the rain lol i‚Äôm all ears for what you have in mind rerussia i‚Äôll follow up later tonight when i‚Äôm back home,1,True,0,germany,england,3,82,Fall,1902
well i know this gonna sound a bit greedy right away but hear me out if i get stp and you let me have sweden you could have the rest of russia and i believe that to be better because it keeps us with more clear defined borders,1,False,0,england,germany,3,83,Fall,1902
i like to operate on 100 trust and i feel like we got off to a slightly rocky start with the misunderstanding of the dmz,1,True,0,england,germany,3,84,Fall,1902
but im open to your opinions and suggestions to my queen this is a joint effort,1,True,0,england,germany,3,85,Fall,1902
also to make sure we are on the same page this time hol and ruh will be vacated this turn right france and myself already kept our end of the deal i need your confirmation on this so i can vacate nth as well instead of having to cover bel,1,True,0,england,germany,3,86,Fall,1902
yes i will vacate hol and ruh i understand how that made me appear to be flaky but i can assure you that im devoted to this kingqueenship it will be corrected this season,1,True,0,germany,england,3,87,Fall,1902
as for russia i think i can agree with your proposal but first id like to understand a little more how to see france working in all of this france was originally on board with this alliance but has been less vocal so its hard for me to gauge his commitment level,1,True,0,germany,england,3,88,Fall,1902
right and based on the uncertainty we will have to act accordingly with him when the time comes,1,True,0,england,germany,3,89,Fall,1902
and thank you for confirming,1,True,0,england,germany,3,90,Fall,1902
as for right  now he keeps italy busy for us from which we both benefit,1,True,0,england,germany,3,91,Fall,1902
oh hey you never got back with me whether you agree to the proposal on sweden stp for me and the rest of russia for you,1,True,0,england,germany,3,92,Fall,1902
sorry for the delay yes i can agree to that,1,True,0,germany,england,3,93,Fall,1902
no worries my dear and thank you ,1,True,0,england,germany,3,94,Fall,1902
i think after this turn we need to start making wedding plans lol,0,False,0,england,germany,3,95,Fall,1902
we could invite all the nations to attend and bear witness to the consummation of our commitment hahaha,0,False,0,england,germany,3,96,Fall,1902
you moved into hol are you no longer in favor of a dmz france and i upheld our end of the bargain this time around,1,True,0,germany,england,3,97,Fall,1902
yes you did in fact paranoia got the best of me  with everybody getting getting so very suspicious about a western triple ,1,True,3,england,germany,3,98,Winter,1902
where do we go from here,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,99,Spring,1903
youre  willing to salvage this,1,True,3,england,germany,3,100,Spring,1903
potentially  but i‚Äôm worried that you and france are trying to push me out of this triple,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,101,Spring,1903
your silence is troubling,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,102,Spring,1903
i totally understand my apologies i was busy working to put up the last wall on this cabin before  most of the guys here left,1,True,3,england,germany,3,103,Spring,1903
hmm i put myself in a tough spot,1,True,3,england,germany,3,104,Spring,1903
so how would you propose we move forward,1,True,3,england,germany,3,105,Spring,1903
hmmm,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,106,Spring,1903
what do you think if you let me take swe this round and then i promise to allow you a clear pathsupport to take stp as we discussed before that will throw everyone off the western triple suspicions and we can move forward together what do you say,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,107,Spring,1903
hmm to much back tracking imo,1,True,3,england,germany,3,108,Spring,1903
what do you think would be a better option,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,109,Spring,1903
im super busy with work right now throw me another proposal,1,True,3,england,germany,3,110,Spring,1903
you can focus on moving towards stp and i‚Äôll move towards warsaw,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,111,Spring,1903
im up for other suggestions too if anything comes to mind hope work finishes up well,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,112,Spring,1903
thank you yes it came together nicely ,1,True,3,england,germany,3,113,Spring,1903
ugh im truly at a loss as to what to do   i get along with you so very well with yet if i attack russia then turkey will be real  hard to stop will be a long term problem,1,True,3,england,germany,3,114,Spring,1903
the other thing is i have only stp to gain from a war with russia,1,True,3,england,germany,3,115,Spring,1903
also france seeing my moves was real quick to jump on the opportunity he sees for himself and wants munich,1,True,3,england,germany,3,116,Spring,1903
i think really the only option i have other than continuing an invasion on you would be to attack france,1,True,3,england,germany,3,117,Spring,1903
ah i see your points,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,118,Spring,1903
hmmm,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,119,Spring,1903
if you are in fact willing to salvage this thing we have hehe invading france is the only option i see  russia poses no threat now and if france gets attacked then italy is   free to put the brakes on turkey for us,1,,3,england,germany,3,120,Spring,1903
also what on earth is austria doing  thats the other thing looks like turkey has austria in his pocket,1,,3,england,germany,3,121,Spring,1903
well obviously i‚Äôd say to attack france haha  but more than that i think that we work well together and can continue to do so i am on board for a salvage i haven‚Äôt communicated as much with france and he seems to be doing his own thing heading into italy anyways i think that austria is trying to support italy into france i think he wanted to work with turkey against russia but i‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs actually transpiring,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,122,Spring,1903
sorry if you got that multiple times due to me trying to send while bot went down,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,123,Spring,1903
i get that we work really well together but honestly what good is that if its to our detriment,1,True,3,england,germany,3,124,Spring,1903
im saying the 3 of us,1,False,3,england,germany,3,125,Spring,1903
i do know for certain that france is moving to bur i discouraged  the move but he was very set on it said that he doesnt need mar unit against italy anyway,1,True,3,england,germany,3,126,Spring,1903
hmmm good to know i believe that austria is supporting ven into pie but nothing we can do about that at the moment,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,127,Spring,1903
italy did say that they can get austria to cooperate  agaisnt austria so theres  that,1,True,3,england,germany,3,128,Spring,1903
maybe lets you and me tell italy that we are ready to help them out if they can swing austria towards turkey,1,True,3,england,germany,3,129,Spring,1903
yes that sounds good,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,130,Spring,1903
okidoki,1,True,3,england,germany,3,131,Spring,1903
and to ease your heart a bit more this sesson ill  let you in on a lil secret  im moving towards france and away from you i really do want us to work paranoia just got the best of me last season and i know thats not a good thing for a good relationship i will reward in kind,1,True,3,england,germany,3,132,Spring,1903
why thank you üôÇ i do appreciate it,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,133,Spring,1903
ok ive told italy,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,134,Spring,1903
great  and one final thing  thank you thank you  for being such a strong  queen that is a thing of beauty and worth,1,True,3,england,germany,3,135,Spring,1903
ok well im off  to finish the roof have a good night ttyl,1,True,3,england,germany,3,136,Spring,1903
is this my own fault,1,True,3,england,germany,3,137,Fall,1903
what are you referring to,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,138,Fall,1903
frances  moves,1,True,3,england,germany,3,139,Fall,1903
hey are you available to chat real quick,1,True,3,england,germany,3,140,Fall,1903
i wont have time tomorrow,1,True,3,england,germany,3,141,Fall,1903
if you dont have time rn could we at least bounce in holland,1,True,3,england,germany,3,142,Fall,1903
sorry for delay i am traveling this weekend haven‚Äôt had much time online,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,143,Fall,1903
my main priority now is getting another supply center before winter,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,144,Fall,1903
have you cut some deal with russia already for a sc,1,True,3,england,germany,3,145,Fall,1903
i admit i made a hige blunder in an attempt to put the brakes on tirkwy you can have holland back,1,True,3,england,germany,3,146,Fall,1903
ok thank you,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,147,Fall,1903
no i don‚Äôt have any deals yet,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,148,Fall,1903
also i  had a question  did you and france communicate  about bouncing  in bur,1,True,3,england,germany,3,149,Fall,1903
we did a few seasons back but decided against it i was working on a hunch,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,150,Fall,1903
hmmm wonder who warned france,1,True,3,england,germany,3,151,Fall,1903
im trying to hard,1,True,3,england,germany,3,152,Fall,1903
take holland for real and im  gonna slow down and coast along for the ride,1,True,3,england,germany,3,153,Fall,1903
if turkey gets out of his corner so be it,1,True,3,england,germany,3,154,Fall,1903
haha ok sounds good i haven‚Äôt heard from anyone else over the weekend don‚Äôt think much scheming has been going on,1,False,-3,germany,england,3,155,Fall,1903
so france just decides all on his own to  swing up for an attack on me a bit odd i think,1,True,3,england,germany,3,156,Fall,1903
honestly we only had talked about what he was doing with italy and austria,1,True,-3,germany,england,3,157,Fall,1903
i see,1,True,3,england,germany,3,158,Fall,1903
hello my queen how was your weekend,1,,1,england,germany,3,159,Spring,1904
hey it was busy but good how about yourself,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,160,Spring,1904
also thank you for letting me have hol back üòÉ i really appreciate it,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,161,Spring,1904
very worky hehe,1,True,1,england,germany,3,162,Spring,1904
youre very welcome i think thats the least i could do after taking it out of stupid paranoia lol,1,True,1,england,germany,3,163,Spring,1904
haha no need to worry,0,True,-1,germany,england,3,164,Spring,1904
i think that was the last labor pain for the birth of our glorious alliance ,1,True,1,england,germany,3,165,Spring,1904
but im glad you had a good weekend ,1,True,1,england,germany,3,166,Spring,1904
how you want to move forward now,1,True,1,england,germany,3,167,Spring,1904
cheers to that,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,168,Spring,1904
i want to walk with you side by side,1,True,1,england,germany,3,169,Spring,1904
hmmm i haven‚Äôt thought about my next moves yet i can‚Äôt tell who france is trying to work against seems like austria wants to cooperate to get russia knocked out so i‚Äôll probably work with him in central europe a bit,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,170,Spring,1904
ok sure  in the meantime i can deal with frances uncertainty together with italy,1,True,1,england,germany,3,171,Spring,1904
what are you thinking,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,172,Spring,1904
turkey is doing his thing,1,True,1,england,germany,3,173,Spring,1904
oh cool sounds good,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,174,Spring,1904
yeah i was hoping italy could help out with france more seemed like they were still concerned with turkey though last time we talked,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,175,Spring,1904
hmm board wise they look very concerned about france and not so much turkey they even supported turkey to a sc,1,True,1,england,germany,3,176,Spring,1904
that tripped me out when i saw it,1,True,1,england,germany,3,177,Spring,1904
oh you‚Äôre right i guess i‚Äôll touch base with italy again about it,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,178,Spring,1904
yea thatd be good from my perspective italy is way way to committed west,1,True,1,england,germany,3,179,Spring,1904
yeah  i will keep you posted,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,180,Spring,1904
very much appreciated,1,True,1,england,germany,3,181,Spring,1904
sounds like italy is trying to capture marseilles i am considering trying to  bounce there with france again in order to make that happen not sure yet,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,182,Spring,1904
whether you bounce or not marseilles will fall because italy can cut spain support with wes,1,,1,england,germany,3,183,Spring,1904
might be better if you could support belbur,1,,1,england,germany,3,184,Spring,1904
yeah good point,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,185,Spring,1904
the potential problem i see with me supporting belbur is that italy has voiced concern about you and if they see me too obviously on your side it might be hard for me to cooperate with italy,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,186,Spring,1904
lol i felt that coming with the way they were so totally committed west,1,True,1,england,germany,3,187,Spring,1904
in that case we should probably leave france alone to defend against italy,1,True,1,england,germany,3,188,Spring,1904
yeah i think that‚Äôs best this season at least i think we‚Äôll need italy‚Äôs cooperation against turkeyaustria and don‚Äôt want them to turn on us too soon,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,189,Spring,1904
ok sounds good,1,False,1,england,germany,3,190,Spring,1904
so since were not doing anything in france what you say we start pushing our armies east we could hold bel and hol for this turn then in the fall belruh to get ready for a jog through mun in spring and into boh or sil in the following fall,1,True,1,england,germany,3,191,Spring,1904
also fyi i will need nth to be able to convoy pic unit to nwy,1,True,1,england,germany,3,192,Spring,1904
yeah let‚Äôs focus east i‚Äôm not exactly sure what austria is going to do so let‚Äôs take this season to see and go from there,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,193,Spring,1904
cool thanks for the heads up,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,194,Spring,1904
question  are you into what italy is doingm,1,,1,england,germany,3,195,Fall,1904
,1,,1,england,germany,3,196,Fall,1904
idk seems like they are only going after france right now which is just pushing france up against us,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,197,Fall,1904
i haven‚Äôt coordinated with italy much just trying to keep communication open i think italy is open to cooperate with us against france obviously and is trying to keep austria focused on russiaturkey,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,198,Fall,1904
im super busy with work right ill get with you soon as i can,1,True,1,england,germany,3,199,Fall,1904
ok no worries,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,200,Fall,1904
hey just give me a moveset to enter  i dont have time to do any discussing ,1,False,1,england,germany,3,201,Fall,1904
we do need to push east for sure  as much as possible,1,False,1,england,germany,3,202,Fall,1904
ok nvm already put my orders in im holding bel unless you want me to go to ruh to get that unit through mun in spring to help in the east to lock it down before turkey does,1,True,1,england,germany,3,203,Fall,1904
gah sorry i missed this earlier hope life gets less hectic,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,204,Fall,1904
holding bel sounds good to me,1,,-1,germany,england,3,205,Fall,1904
would you be ok with me taking swe so i can get another build this winter just thinking we will need more armies against the east im amenable to another flip flop in the future üôÇ,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,206,Fall,1904
ok will do im very sorry i havent had much time for you,1,True,1,england,germany,3,207,Fall,1904
yea im good with that it is paramount to get armies east,1,True,1,england,germany,3,208,Fall,1904
im working on getting some in from the north,1,True,1,england,germany,3,209,Fall,1904

likewise for you sir,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,212,Fall,1904
do you know where i got that quote from lol,1,True,1,england,germany,3,213,Fall,1904
no haha sorry i am guessing its from a movie,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,214,Fall,1904
yep  the movie of queen esther,1,True,1,england,germany,3,215,Fall,1904
i may just call you my queen esther lol,1,True,1,england,germany,3,216,Fall,1904
unless youre name is prettier than that,1,True,1,england,germany,3,217,Fall,1904
i am sir redacted the first ,1,True,1,england,germany,3,218,Fall,1904
esther is a regal name i like that,0,True,-1,germany,england,3,219,Fall,1904
i havent heard of that move though haha,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,220,Fall,1904
queen esther it is ,1,True,1,england,germany,3,221,Fall,1904
perfect üòÉ,1,True,-1,germany,england,3,222,Fall,1904
hey hope work is less busy today let me know what youre thinking this season im going to push armies east,1,True,1,germany,england,3,223,Spring,1905
well still going hard but i can take a min for you ms queen esther  ,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,224,Spring,1905
ok üôÇ nothing very urgent,1,True,1,germany,england,3,225,Spring,1905
basically my plan is just push east with you,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,226,Spring,1905
just wondering what you think we should do about france in the next few seasons,1,True,1,germany,england,3,227,Spring,1905
idk what do you suggest,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,228,Spring,1905
hes pretty tied up with italy and italy is tied up with him,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,229,Spring,1905
we could take him out or let him keep italy in check but then again we could use italys help against turkey,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,230,Spring,1905
yeah im not sure if its better to cooperate with italy and take out france or just let the two of them fight it out a little longer  i just wanted to check if youd make any agreements recently to france,1,True,1,germany,england,3,231,Spring,1905
i havent talked to him in a season or two,1,True,1,germany,england,3,232,Spring,1905
just that i would ceasefire on our borders so he could focus on italy,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,233,Spring,1905
nothing beyond that,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,234,Spring,1905
im inclined to just cooperate with italy and take him out that would be one less loose end if we do that then we would have italys and austrias help to eliminate turkey,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,235,Spring,1905
also in about one more year it will be time to start insinuating to italy and austria  that we will betray each other after turkey is gone,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,236,Spring,1905
ok good to know,1,True,1,germany,england,3,237,Spring,1905
yes i like both of those plans,1,True,1,germany,england,3,238,Spring,1905
i think itll be fairly easy to take france out at this point and italy seems cooperative and its likely we could each get a supply center if we help,1,True,1,germany,england,3,239,Spring,1905
would you support me into moscow and let me know if you need my support in bur or anywhere,1,True,1,germany,england,3,240,Spring,1905
and thanks again for swe last winter hopefully we can put some of these new armies to good use,1,True,1,germany,england,3,241,Spring,1905
frankly i was expecting to get moscow since i gave you sweden,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,242,Spring,1905
i wouldnt mind sharing france with you though,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,243,Spring,1905
besides i have 2 armies that i need to put to use in the east i could get the far eastern fringe of russia and you would be getting most of austria,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,244,Spring,1905
ooo i dont want to count the chicks before they hatch but imaging an english turkey austria for you turkey for me and we share the balkans or something along those lines,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,245,Spring,1905
about support to bur let me see first if france will reply and accept my offer to help him regain marseilles,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,246,Spring,1905
ok that seems fair i know we had talked about you just having stp when we originally discussed russia the only problem is that austria is really worried about you at the moment and doesnt want to cooperate or make moves against turkey when he sees you rolling down russia,1,True,1,germany,england,3,247,Spring,1905
italy is spooking everybody about me ,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,248,Spring,1905
so what does austria want me to do then stab you instead of going south to help against turkey,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,249,Spring,1905
and yes i hear you about our original discussion although we can both testify that a lot has happened since then lol always hard to project a concrete future you know,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,250,Spring,1905
i think austria just wants everyone else to stay put except him haha,1,True,1,germany,england,3,251,Spring,1905
let me ask you my queen esther are you uncomfortable with me having units all around you,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,252,Spring,1905
i could understand such a feeling which is why im trying to keep as far away from your borders as possible while simultaneously keeping up with your growth,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,253,Spring,1905
half of the kingdom seems to be coming to fruition sooner than expected hahaha,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,254,Spring,1905
hah yes i understand too i suppose im feeling a bit undecided on how to deal with austria at the moment,1,True,1,germany,england,3,255,Spring,1905
tell you what you take moscow then and  ill stay in the background like a lion ready to pounce at the right time you get your leverage on austria with that and in return you help me get paris and bre,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,256,Spring,1905
im moving into pru to insinuate to austria that ill be trying to move into stp and hopefully that will be enough to keep him off my back another season or two,1,True,1,germany,england,3,257,Spring,1905
oops we sent messages at the same time haha,1,True,1,germany,england,3,258,Spring,1905
or i go to moscow this spring and you ask him to move to ukr to support you into moscow in the fall,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,259,Spring,1905
the move to pru works with both plans,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,260,Spring,1905
hmm both good ideas though it seems unlikely that you wouldnt bounce in moscow without my support and if i support you then the whole rue with austria is up,1,True,1,germany,england,3,261,Spring,1905
ruse,1,True,1,germany,england,3,262,Spring,1905
i must admit ive been in bed with russia too üò¨ hehe he told me himself he would help me get moscow to keep turkey from getting it,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,263,Spring,1905
russia was just a concubine tho lol,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,264,Spring,1905
better be haha,1,True,1,germany,england,3,265,Spring,1905
ok then lets go with your second plan,1,True,1,germany,england,3,266,Spring,1905
my dear esther i put it on my kingdom that concubine is all it was lol,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,267,Spring,1905
all right second plan it is then,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,268,Spring,1905
well turkey is very very adamant about moscow being rightfully his,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,269,Spring,1905
he just tried to get my support into moscow too which i declined,1,True,1,germany,england,3,270,Spring,1905
good,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,271,Spring,1905
thank you,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,272,Spring,1905
what did he say to that,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,273,Spring,1905
i think he‚Äôll move into ukr instead so hopefully turkey and austria will at least bounce there,1,True,1,germany,england,3,274,Spring,1905
sweet did you tell him that you want moscow,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,275,Spring,1905
no he guessed that you and i had plans to split up russia but i evaded that part of the convo haha,1,True,1,germany,england,3,276,Spring,1905
thats my queen,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,277,Spring,1905
did you intend to hold everywhere,1,True,1,germany,england,3,278,Spring,1905
ah that sux  i was in a business meeting,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,279,Spring,1905
i absolutely did not intend to do that,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,280,Spring,1905
and france moving on me he explicitly said he was not moving against me this season,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,281,Spring,1905
üò¶,1,True,1,germany,england,3,282,Spring,1905
mind if i get either moscow or sweden i pretty much need a build in lvp to fight france back,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,283,Spring,1905
,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,284,Fall,1905
hey sorry for the delay was kind of checked out for the weekend haha yeah happy to give back swe would you be ok supporting me into moscow,1,True,1,germany,england,3,285,Fall,1905
thought austria was supporting you turkey gave up on getting moscow,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,286,Fall,1905
but yes i can support you,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,287,Fall,1905
yeah i thought so too but he hasn‚Äôt responded all weekendso thank you i‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs just offline i can keep you posted though,1,True,1,germany,england,3,288,Fall,1905
could you please support ruhbel,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,289,Fall,1905

thank you queen esther,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,292,Fall,1905
of course king,1,True,1,germany,england,3,293,Fall,1905
ok austria got back to me and is supporting me into moscow so don‚Äôt worry about it,1,True,1,germany,england,3,294,Fall,1905
in that case should go to moscow as well to show conflict to the other nations,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,295,Fall,1905
yeah good idea,1,True,1,germany,england,3,296,Fall,1905
really is to bad that i missed my moves last season  that wouldve been awesome ammunition to use against them hehe,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,297,Fall,1905
yeah oh welli still think we are in good shape for the time being,1,True,1,germany,england,3,298,Fall,1905
yea youre right the sweden move will also help,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,299,Fall,1905
i will definitely look the the bad guy this season üë∫,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,300,Fall,1905
hahah here he comes,1,True,1,germany,england,3,301,Fall,1905
austria will be excited and happy üòÖ,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,302,Fall,1905
oh boy italy too üòÇ,1,True,1,germany,england,3,303,Fall,1905
true that,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,304,Fall,1905
have you heard anything from france,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,305,Fall,1905
he claims he has no interest in fighting me  im like whats with the belgium disaster  haha,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,306,Fall,1905
he only mentioned that you wanted bur that‚Äôs all though that was last friday,1,True,1,germany,england,3,307,Fall,1905
i see  quite the trickster,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,308,Fall,1905
did you even talk about that with him,1,True,1,germany,england,3,309,Fall,1905
only asked him if hed like for me to go help him get mar back,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,310,Fall,1905
when he declined the offer i said ok,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,311,Fall,1905
ahhhh gotcha,1,True,1,germany,england,3,312,Fall,1905
maybe your lack of action this season will cause him to back offhead back for italy,1,True,1,germany,england,3,313,Fall,1905
last season,1,True,1,germany,england,3,314,Fall,1905
hopefully,1,True,-1,england,germany,3,315,Fall,1905
apologies my queen i had completely discarded the idea that russia might add the support again since he was radio silent,0,True,0,england,germany,3,316,Winter,1905
glad you got vie at least,1,True,0,england,germany,3,317,Winter,1905
that‚Äôs ok i‚Äôll def need your support to moscow now since austria is mad at me üòÇ,1,True,0,germany,england,3,318,Winter,1905
raging mad or just mad haha,1,True,0,england,germany,3,319,Winter,1905
at least passiveaggressive mad haha,1,True,0,germany,england,3,320,Winter,1905
they want to still work with you i imagine,1,True,0,england,germany,3,321,Winter,1905
doesn‚Äôt seem like it ,1,True,0,germany,england,3,322,Winter,1905
at least they locked horns with the turkish now,1,True,0,england,germany,3,323,Winter,1905
ill dedicate my unit in stp to help you in whatever way you need in the east and in turn could you dedicate one unit to help me smash out this french nuisance,1,True,0,england,germany,3,324,Winter,1905
also i did not expect that move into vie so i appreciate my queen being willing to be the bad guy along with me haha,1,True,0,england,germany,3,325,Winter,1905
thank you and yes  vie was a last minute decisionmaybe should have waiting longer to break non aggression with austria but he made it too tempting,1,True,0,germany,england,3,326,Winter,1905
should have waited,1,True,0,germany,england,3,327,Winter,1905
perhaps but i think you will be fine with my unit to help you,1,True,0,england,germany,3,328,Winter,1905
yes i think so too,1,True,0,germany,england,3,329,Winter,1905
hmm just noticed something tho if  i get you into mos that would block my unit off from being able to help think we may have to swap again,1,True,0,england,germany,3,330,Winter,1905
swap where,1,True,0,germany,england,3,331,Winter,1905
just want to make sure i understand what you‚Äôre thinking,1,True,0,germany,england,3,332,Winter,1905
like swap moscow for swe that way i can use my unit in the east to help you,1,False,0,england,germany,3,333,Winter,1905
ok gotcha works for me ill move my fleet back to swe and let you have mos,1,True,0,germany,england,3,334,Spring,1906
cool deal,1,True,0,england,germany,3,335,Spring,1906
france wants me to suggest something for him any ideas,1,True,0,england,germany,3,336,Spring,1906
leave bre behind hahaha,1,True,0,germany,england,3,337,Spring,1906
hmm,1,True,0,germany,england,3,338,Spring,1906
do you want to leave him alone this season or no,1,True,0,germany,england,3,339,Spring,1906
not necessarily but i could to have him go south,1,True,0,england,germany,3,340,Spring,1906
do you think he‚Äôs going to actually do what you suggest,1,True,0,germany,england,3,341,Spring,1906
not really but he might since i have him pinned,1,True,0,england,germany,3,342,Spring,1906
yeah fingers crossed i guess if he goes south it would get you easier access even in a season or two,1,True,0,germany,england,3,343,Spring,1906
what if i openly make plans with him to stab you if he goes south,1,True,0,england,germany,3,344,Spring,1906
that might work i don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs particularly worried about me or not,1,True,0,germany,england,3,345,Spring,1906
ok ill see what happens and keep you posted,1,True,0,england,germany,3,346,Spring,1906
cool thank you,1,True,0,germany,england,3,347,Spring,1906
my regal queen are you online,1,True,0,england,germany,3,348,Spring,1906
yes briefly i have to get in the car to drive home soon what‚Äôs up,1,True,0,germany,england,3,349,Spring,1906
so france will move to ruh and bur,1,True,0,england,germany,3,350,Spring,1906
with 100 trust we can pull off a super cool moveset this year,1,True,0,england,germany,3,351,Spring,1906
ok what are you thinking,1,True,0,germany,england,3,352,Spring,1906
we let france go into ruh in hopes of getting mun and i force into hol with support and you retreat into kiel in the fall i move back out of hol and towards france while you support mun with kiel to deny france,1,True,0,england,germany,3,353,Spring,1906
of course only if you are on board,1,True,0,england,germany,3,354,Spring,1906
i do trust you to follow through with the moves but seems like i still end up losing hol at least for next winter is the goal just to keep france occupied so you can get into france from the other side,1,True,0,germany,england,3,355,Spring,1906
i have to drive now will be back online as soon as i can,1,True,0,germany,england,3,356,Spring,1906
no my queen i  will be leaving hol in the fall,1,True,0,england,germany,3,357,Spring,1906
but i‚Äôll need the kie unit to support mun i think ü§î,1,True,0,germany,england,3,358,Spring,1906
precisely hence the reason of me moving out of hol on my own in the fall,1,True,0,england,germany,3,359,Spring,1906
ah gotcha  ok let‚Äôs go for it i‚Äôm in,1,True,0,germany,england,3,360,Spring,1906
cool deal setting my orders as such,1,True,0,england,germany,3,361,Spring,1906
also could you wait to move into swe until the fall,1,True,0,england,germany,3,362,Spring,1906
yeah guess that‚Äôll make the whole thing look less planned to everyone else you‚Äôre either a genius or an evil genius hah,1,True,0,germany,england,3,363,Spring,1906
lol you choose ,1,True,0,england,germany,3,364,Spring,1906
and yes the idea was to not let the other nations catch on to what were doing,1,False,0,england,germany,3,365,Spring,1906
still all good to go with the plan,1,True,0,germany,england,3,366,Fall,1906
absolutely my queen,1,True,0,england,germany,3,367,Fall,1906
perfect,1,True,0,germany,england,3,368,Fall,1906

actually nvm that russia is defending mos,1,True,0,england,germany,3,371,Fall,1906
oh that‚Äôs good austria is definitely after vie but i can‚Äôt tell if italy will support them there so austria could try to get turkeys support into war or if he‚Äôll use both gal and bud for vie,1,True,0,germany,england,3,372,Fall,1906
i get the impression that austria and turkey have worked together and against each other off and on so it‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs going on,1,True,0,germany,england,3,373,Fall,1906
woooooo high five,1,True,0,germany,england,3,374,Fall,1906

hahah what‚Äôs the idea italy and i were going to coordinate to get me into ank and then you can take bre and wrap things up sounds like we only have two more moves,1,True,0,germany,england,3,421,Spring,1910
this spring turn i would put a fleet in nao and nth while you move nth into nrg and swe into ska my army in nwy goes to swe and in the fall turn it convoys across a body of 9 fleets all the way around the world into syria,1,True,0,england,germany,3,422,Spring,1910
oh wow i guess we could do thatlet me know if italy is on board too we can check with the admin but it seems like the game is ending winter 1910 in which case your army in syria won‚Äôt be doing anything but i guess this might be a once in a lifetime chance haha,1,True,0,germany,england,3,423,Spring,1910

mine is set to 3 way draw as well,1,True,0,england,germany,3,434,Winter,1910
hi germanyit seems our paths are finally crossing  im guessing england has made plans with you for the two of you to take over russia especially if you help england into moscow i cant help but notice that englands territory is starting tosurround yours that doesnt make for a good partnership i on the other hand would pose little threat to you in moscow and could help keep england at bay in the northbaltic  im open to negotiation if you are,1,True,-2,turkey,germany,3,0,Spring,1905
hey turkey nice to finally meet you i‚Äôm definitely open to negotiation the problem at the moment is that it seems like russia is going to support england into moscow so even if i support you you‚Äôd bounce and i can‚Äôt afford to have england after me just for that,1,True,2,germany,turkey,3,1,Spring,1905
i‚Äôm not sure what your relationship with austria has been so far he‚Äôs been cooperative with me however he seemed so single minded about getting rid of russiai can‚Äôt tell what he wants to do next,1,,2,germany,turkey,3,2,Spring,1905
austria and i have been working together solely on taking down russia so im not sure of their long term plans eitherand i havent heard from a since winter  i understand about not supporting me into moscow and i appreciate the tip about russia could i perhaps just get an agreement from you not to block me moving to ukraine,1,,-2,turkey,germany,3,3,Spring,1905
ok that‚Äôs what it seemed like i can agree to that,1,True,2,germany,turkey,3,4,Spring,1905
are you still interested in moscow,1,True,3,germany,turkey,3,5,Fall,1906
oh yes why do you ask,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,3,6,Fall,1906
if theres any chance you could cut support from livonia itd be greatly appreciated,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,3,7,Fall,1906
gah never mind i was thinking about proposing as such but i think i‚Äôll need the units elsewhere let‚Äôs stay in touch though let me know if you‚Äôre ever open to coordinating to control the growth of austria andor england in the east,1,True,3,germany,turkey,3,8,Fall,1906
i am open to both of those i already have plans to curb austria in the balkans so if there‚Äôs anything i can do to help you with the same in the north just met me know,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,3,9,Fall,1906
glad you and italy were able to put a dent into austria,1,True,3,germany,turkey,3,10,Fall,1906
thanks were gonna keep working on it what are your plans for eastern europe these days,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,3,11,Fall,1906
i‚Äôm not sure yet i think i‚Äôll wait to see where austria disbands,1,True,3,germany,turkey,3,12,Fall,1906
any chance youd support me into moscow this year,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,3,13,Spring,1907
barring that i do think its worth collaborating in the future to keep italy and england in check dont you agree,1,True,-3,turkey,germany,3,14,Spring,1907
i can‚Äôt support you into moscow this season but i do agree about coordinating against italy and england it seems like austria is solely focused on slowing down italy at this point i suspect you could get rum this season,1,True,3,germany,turkey,3,15,Spring,1907
so aaaaany chance youre ready to help me stand up to england if nothing else i think itd be a good way for us to build up trust so that we can take on the rising italy threat once austrias dealt with,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,3,16,Winter,1907
i can‚Äôt this turn but i definitely want to work together maybe next season we can have a deal something like if you support me into bud i‚Äôll support you into serbia,0,True,1,germany,turkey,3,17,Spring,1908
i was thinking the same thing  could you reassure me a bit by telling me what you‚Äôre stationed in galicia for and how long you plan to be there,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,3,18,Spring,1908

please rest assured i‚Äôm still committed to our alliance england says you‚Äôre focusing on taking out italy,1,True,0,germany,france,3,15,Fall,1902
yes to both,1,True,0,france,germany,3,16,Fall,1902
question is whether youre going to drop into tyrolia and im not sure which autocorrect version of that was funnier probably tortilla,1,True,0,france,germany,3,17,Fall,1902
i guess there other question is whether it would be worthwhile to bounce in burgundy as both armies have not much better to do right now,1,True,0,france,germany,3,18,Fall,1902
i am going to hold off on tyrolia for now lets bounce in burgundy i like that idea,1,True,0,germany,france,3,19,Fall,1902
actually never mind will be moving elsewhere to get out of hol and ruh,1,True,0,germany,france,3,20,Fall,1902
ok then,1,False,0,france,germany,3,21,Fall,1902

sorry was a last minute hunch that we‚Äôd bounce since we talked about it last season,1,False,-1,germany,france,3,29,Fall,1903
alrighty  this season i was actually trying to move up to threaten belgium and help you deal with the english  supporting me up toward that end would be greatly appreciated,1,True,1,france,germany,3,30,Fall,1903
ah thank you i can do that,1,True,-1,germany,france,3,31,Fall,1903

have you been able to get help from england at all,1,True,3,germany,france,3,41,Spring,1905
not especially beyond backing off a bit  he did offer to walk his army through burgundy which i thought was special,1,True,-3,france,germany,3,42,Spring,1905
hah how generous,1,True,3,germany,france,3,43,Spring,1905
you want to coordinate belhol or are you still trying to remain neutral,0,True,-3,france,germany,3,44,Fall,1906
ugh idk i might have to remain neutral there another season i can‚Äôt afford england coming after me from the north or east and he‚Äôs agreed to stop at moscow for now i‚Äôll let you know if anything changes,0,True,3,germany,france,3,45,Fall,1906
eh fecker tried to get me to plow into you so he could walk into me again  please forgive my transgression thats my exclusive focus now,1,True,-3,france,germany,3,46,Fall,1906
ugh ok you‚Äôre forgiven are you trying to get bel next,1,True,3,germany,france,3,47,Spring,1907
yes very much so primary goal is to deny any english builds though,1,,-3,france,germany,3,48,Spring,1907
ive been on both the giving and receiving ends of multiple games in which austria italy and russia decided that their games would be much simpler if there wasnt a turkey around and it always was i propose that we start the game off by coordinating a removal of turkey before moving on to other priorities,1,True,1,russia,austria,3,0,Spring,1901
i think that would be a great idea how would you propose we split up their territories  afterward and could i count on your support should germany move towards me,1,True,-1,austria,russia,3,1,Spring,1901
yeah id definitely have your back against germany as for the split i get ankara and rumania you get bulgaria and constantinople and italy gets greece and smyrna,1,True,1,russia,austria,3,2,Spring,1901
fantastic id personally prefer rumaniabulgaria and you can have constantinopleankara,1,True,-1,austria,russia,3,3,Spring,1901
that also works,1,True,1,russia,austria,3,4,Spring,1901
ah shit im sorry i meant to update my orders to fix the galicia move but it didnt go through ill be sending galicia to rumania this turn and then turning rumania over to you next turn promise,1,False,1,russia,austria,3,5,Fall,1901
want black sea to support you into bulgaria,1,True,1,russia,austria,3,6,Fall,1901
yes that would be wonderful,1,True,-1,austria,russia,3,7,Fall,1901
fuckin goddammit backstabbr i acknowledge this might ring hollow two seasons in a row but i swear to god i had updated my orders but they just didnt take i guess,1,False,1,russia,austria,3,8,Winter,1901
ive got a support order in for serbul,1,False,1,russia,austria,3,9,Fall,1902
i can help you against turkey still yknow,1,True,1,russia,austria,3,10,Spring,1903
turkey didnt benefit anything from your little stab there and im still in a position to get my forces together to do some good defensive work we can patch this thing up man,1,,1,russia,austria,3,11,Spring,1903
hi,1,,1,russia,austria,3,12,Spring,1903
im still trying here dude,1,,1,russia,austria,3,13,Fall,1903
literally the only person in this game to whom ive actively lied is turkey every other message ive sent has gotten the thumbs up,1,False,1,russia,austria,3,14,Fall,1903
hello archduke just wanted to give a friendly wave and wish you luck in your endeavors  ,1,True,0,england,austria,3,0,Spring,1901
greetings hope the royal family is in good health i wish you the same to you,1,True,0,austria,england,3,1,Spring,1901
thank you kind sir yes we are all in good health  at least for this first season that is haha,1,True,0,england,austria,3,2,Spring,1901
curious if youve gotten the memo about russia,1,True,1,england,austria,3,3,Fall,1902
that they seem to be trying to play everybody,1,True,-1,austria,england,3,4,Fall,1902
yea that one lol,1,True,1,england,austria,3,5,Fall,1902
hello archduke sir  looks like you have a nice cozy relationship with the sultan is that something youd be willing to bring to an end in order to keep the genie from getting out of his corner,1,True,3,england,austria,3,6,Spring,1903
i understand if you would rather not comment on that at this point,1,True,3,england,austria,3,7,Spring,1903
gotta say the tsar has gained my ire more that the sultans,1,True,-3,austria,england,3,8,Fall,1903
i understand,1,True,3,england,austria,3,9,Fall,1903
was vienna staged or is that an ouch,1,False,2,england,austria,3,10,Winter,1905
greetings neighbor was wondering if you would like to come to some agreement about how to preliminarily divide up the balkans,1,,0,turkey,austria,3,0,Spring,1901
hello there i think that would be great how were you thinking of splitting them up,0,True,0,austria,turkey,3,1,Spring,1901
hmm can i take  bul  rum while you take ser  gre,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,2,Spring,1901
id prefer ser and rum out of those four,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,3,Spring,1901
i know that would be your preference but russia has offered to support me into rum anyway so i figured thered be less hard feelings if we could just agree to this split and both potentially get two builds or if russia has made conflicting promises to you then i hope youd let me know and then a id appreciate the intel and b we could split things your way,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,4,Spring,1901
got some bad news for you then russia also told me the same stuff think he might playing both sides to see what he can get,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,5,Spring,1901
i think its unwise to be dishonest early in the game just makes everyone trust you less  would you be willing to pool intelligence and maybe see to it that neither of us gets bamboozled,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,6,Spring,1901
specifically what has russia offered you,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,7,Spring,1901
sorry if i pry too much id still like to work together if youre interested,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,8,Fall,1901
shall i take your silence as a no,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,9,Fall,1901
listen i dont know what russia has promised you but they have been reneging on promises left and right ask england ask italy ask germany i can understand if you dont want to trust anyone including me but as a friendly word of advice dont leave yourself vulnerable to russia because they appear by all accounts to be a ruthless opportunist,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,10,Spring,1902
yeah ive noticed im not keep my units on hold until i know whats going you dont have to worry about me making aggressions just yet,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,11,Spring,1902
i appreciate that im not planning any aggressions toward you this season either and i suppose itd be asking too much to encourage you to take rum or to aid me in doing so,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,12,Spring,1902
id really prefer not antagonizing anyone just yet being the middle i feel like any move i make can get me in a sticky situation,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,13,Fall,1902
i understand the feeling the fact that you kept your word just now goes a long way with me let me know if your mind changes about antagonizing or if theres anything i can do to help you out,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,14,Fall,1902
sending to italy and austria  france germany and england‚Äôs behavior combined with some things england has said to me smell of a triple alliance between those three do you agree or have any additional evidence if so i want to make sure southeast europe is prepared to push back against such a threat,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,15,Fall,1902
i would agree though i think they probably dont like russia,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,16,Fall,1902
i can agree there i just wanted to plant a seed in case this might have to turn into a battle of those three versus us three,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,17,Fall,1902
want to make moves on russia,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,18,Fall,1902
i would id greatly appreciate support into rum if youre willing,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,19,Fall,1902
in return ill offer you bulgaria as a loan,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,20,Fall,1902
got my support,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,21,Fall,1902
glad to hear it üôÇ,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,22,Fall,1902
supporting from ser,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,23,Fall,1902
okay i was gonna ask whether you wanted to move serbul but i can understand if you dont trust italy,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,24,Fall,1902
im fine moving in after we take rum i trust italy pretty well,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,25,Fall,1902
actually could i offer you rum instead of bul i can support you in this turn and if you think viennas safe you can also support from bud,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,26,Spring,1903
thats fine for me i imagine that russia knows whats going to happen and will probably try to take vie so id like to make a move to protect it,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,27,Spring,1903
so youre going to bounce tyr and bud im asking because i was wondering whether youd be able to support italy into piedmont im still trying to make a triple alliance between us three happen,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,28,Spring,1903
to clarify you want me to move into bul with your support then we switch who controls either next phase,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,29,Spring,1903
im moving my fleet into tri to assist im willing to put myself in a dangerous spot for a bit if we can make serious moves on russia if russia moves in then it should expose their west side to you,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,30,Spring,1903
well so depending on if i can get italy to support me into bul id have you move to rum this turn   what do you mean moves in,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,31,Spring,1903
if russia moves their gal army into vie,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,32,Spring,1903
okay yes i agree that wouldnt be a big problem for you because it leaves russia vulnerable to me and because you could pretty easily just take vienna back provided munich isnt an issue,1,False,0,turkey,austria,3,33,Spring,1903
italy confirmed that theyd support me into bul so ill support ser into rum this turn unless i hear otherwise,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,34,Spring,1903
yeah currently in a nonaggression with germany assuming that holds i think we can make a good push against russia im on my phone doing this so i have to constantly tab back and forth between discord and backstabber thats why this is a bit confusing,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,35,Spring,1903
support into rum is greatly appreciated,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,36,Spring,1903
ah yeah thats a pain and happy to do it and i hope you and italy can coordinate as well although i know that means more tabbing for you,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,37,Spring,1903
im surviving i think were coordinated as best as we can for now,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,38,Spring,1903
so if youre not doing a bounce in vienna would bud be free to poke gal,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,39,Spring,1903
yes i suppose i could do that,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,40,Spring,1903
worst case for you would still be that gal moves to vienna i was suggesting it incase russia decides to use gal and ukr to support bul into rum but if you think thats unlikely then its probably not worth the risk,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,41,Spring,1903
may be better to just have bud support serrum for some extra security,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,42,Spring,1903
rum is guaranteed for you this yearwhich will set us up nicely to start surrounding warsawmoscow,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,43,Fall,1903
are you still with me to invade russia i could use your support for sevukr,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,44,Spring,1904
yeah,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,45,Spring,1904
great and i assume you‚Äôll also push into galicia,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,46,Spring,1904
yeah,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,47,Spring,1904
are you hearing anything from germany,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,48,Fall,1904
broadly speaking if you arrange with germany to support them into warsaw ill help you take warsaw for yourself once im able to do so if you want me to,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,49,Fall,1904
just sort of normal truce then deal with england after russia is gone,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,50,Fall,1904
so what do you think is the best course of action for us this season,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,51,Fall,1904
well russia is going to lose either stp or mos so you can try to move into mos hoping they move back or one of can support the other into ukr im trying to get germany to support me into war and told them i would help them take stp once russia was gone and england was the threat,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,52,Fall,1904
thanks for the info i think trying for ukraine again makes more sense if you‚Äôre willing to support me in,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,53,Fall,1904
that works for me ill support with rum,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,54,Fall,1904
would you like support into ukraine the better to take warsaw,1,,0,turkey,austria,3,55,Spring,1905
id still like to collaborate with you and id like to help you however i can provided of course youre okay with me having moscow,1,,0,turkey,austria,3,56,Spring,1905
alright im getting the vibe that you dont want to try and work things out with me,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,57,Fall,1905
i know that i attacked you just a season ago but germany has betrayed me after i helped them being in the middle i see this as me being about to get caught up in a whole mess and id really like to go after the person who made moves into my home territory if you want to attack mos next spring ill support you from the ukr,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,58,Winter,1905
the two of us are not enough to hold it against germanyengland so your offerunlike your betrayal of meis empty,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,3,59,Winter,1905
in my defense the plan to take you out was only delayed not stopped,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,60,Winter,1905
not exactly a betrayal,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,61,Winter,1905
look im sorry i snapped if youd be willing to back off me and return bul id be happy to help you against germany or at the very least not antagonize you while you fight them,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,3,62,Spring,1906
you can have ukr back to start i need to reposition before i can just hand off bul hope you understand,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,63,Spring,1906
okay i‚Äôll take ukraine this turn then thank you,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,3,64,Spring,1906
is italy helping you retake vienna,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,3,65,Fall,1906
either than or giving me an extra serving of betrayal,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,66,Fall,1906
ah thats always the question isnt it im wondering if im under any threat from the two of you in constantinoplelast i spoke with italy italys units had come over here on the promise of you two destroying me it kiiinda looks like thats still the case,0,True,-1,turkey,austria,3,67,Fall,1906
well italy has told me that as well but then again germany also told me we had a nonaggression and here we are i believe this turn well see if italy is going for you or me im taking back vienna from germany and thats my plan for now,1,False,1,austria,turkey,3,68,Fall,1906
i really wish i could believe that was all you were planning,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,3,69,Fall,1906
until i have stability thats all im doing,1,False,1,austria,turkey,3,70,Fall,1906
looks like i got betrayed big time im thinking of going after italy primarily because they were my first ally and their betrayal hurts the most once im back at my comp ill have a better idea of how im proceeding,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,71,Fall,1906
if you decide to not work with italy i can push them back then you can freely take my territory self preservation is out the door i just dont want italy or germany to gain anything from their betrayal,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,72,Fall,1906
i think its a little premature for you to entirely throw out self preservation ill think it over,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,3,73,Fall,1906
the walls are closing in im not going out without payback,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,74,Fall,1906
any thoughts on the matter,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,75,Fall,1906
whatever im proceeding as if youre with m,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,76,Fall,1906
disbanding gal ill support you full into bul the from there on out we can push italy out of my territory until my inevitable demise,1,,1,austria,turkey,3,77,Fall,1906
hey sorry for the delay in getting back to you‚Äîitaly has promised me bul but i appreciate your support in case they are lying,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,3,78,Fall,1906
well they betrayed me so your betrayal is just around the corner,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,79,Fall,1906
i want to see the streets run red with their ragu and break their spaghetti bones,1,,1,austria,turkey,3,80,Fall,1906
i think that seems likely  and revenge sure brings out your poetic side  you know that‚Äôs kind of how i felt about you when you stabbed me after working with me for several turns,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,3,81,Fall,1906
once again never stabbed you we never had an agreement for anything other than nonaggression until russia was dealt with,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,82,Fall,1906
well you aggressed and russia was not dealt with,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,3,83,Fall,1906
believe me or not but i held out on attacking you as long as a i could and i think thats why italy turned on me,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,84,Fall,1906
i aggressed to keep italy off of me for all the good it did,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,85,Fall,1906
any chance you think germany would turn to your cause,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,3,86,Fall,1906
they have more manpower to take down italy than i do,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,3,87,Fall,1906
im asking them if they want to help,1,True,1,austria,turkey,3,88,Fall,1906
germany said theyre in but sounds reluctant to attack directly so im not sure if theyre actually committed to anything or if its just another ruse,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,89,Winter,1906
whats the word bird,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,90,Spring,1907
sorry for the delay‚Äîtell me how i can help is there any chance you‚Äôd willingly let me into rum this season,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,91,Spring,1907
think of it as you helping yourself really if you support my push from rum into bul you can just move in and take rum in the same turn then we can do the same maneuver next season to greece hopefully,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,92,Spring,1907
not sure how you feel about germany but i think theyre still working with italy i asked them for some help and they gave excuses so im expecting them to move from the north on me this sesason if they dont it will be a pleasant surprise just a heads up for whats coming though,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,93,Spring,1907
for clarification you support rum into bul and move either ukr or sev into rum next season you support bul into gre and move something else into bul you get italy out of your hair and stick it back to them if germany actually helps then i continue to push and you follow my units if they dont then i hold off and you take my territory noble last stand and all that noise,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,94,Spring,1907
okay thanks for clarifying i just placed the order,0,True,0,turkey,austria,3,95,Spring,1907
i support you from rum into bud and you support from bul into gre then you move into next round to prevent italy from gaining units,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,96,Fall,1907
also open to suggestions just realized that right now there isnt a lot that stops italy from getting production,1,,0,austria,turkey,3,97,Fall,1907
i don‚Äôt have a unit that can reach greece to support you there,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,98,Fall,1907
just noticed that as well,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,99,Fall,1907
i think you should try for serbia into tripoli because italy confirmed that they‚Äôre attacking serbia with albania,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,100,Fall,1907
okay then do you want to support bul into ser and you can move con into bul if you choose,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,101,Fall,1907
i‚Äôm a little hesitant to piss off italy to be honest,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,102,Fall,1907
they were pretty upset about last season and i only just barely smoothed it over,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,103,Fall,1907
well you can either piss them off and have them attack you or you can be nice and have them attack you only one of them ends with you gaining something out of it,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,104,Fall,1907
that‚Äôsa very good point,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,105,Fall,1907
im obviously fairly heavily committed to my attack on you at the moment but i do consider turkeys shenanigans around bulgaria a breach so before i forgive and forget i thought id offer you a chance to negotiate,1,,0,austria,turkey,3,106,Fall,1907
yeah seems like it was really smoothed over,1,,0,austria,turkey,3,107,Fall,1907
ah okay so what did you say to italy,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,108,Fall,1907
at least when my people die theyll die knowing they honored their alliance have fun under the boots of england,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,109,Fall,1907
that‚Äôs pretty good alright i‚Äôm moving into bul and i‚Äôll support you into ser,1,True,0,turkey,austria,3,110,Fall,1907
word ill put the moves in,1,True,0,austria,turkey,3,111,Fall,1907
i think im going to disband at vie i can use my other two units to support you into ser or support with one at gre and one at bud,1,True,-4,austria,turkey,3,112,Winter,1907
i think itd help me more if you dissolve albania and hit ser and bud to cut support so that italy cant take rum or bul   i really will support you into bud this spring if you want im sorry i didnt follow through on support for you last night but at like 1130 when i finalized my orders i ultimately decided id need another fleet and therefore a guaranteed build in bul to protect from italy,1,True,4,turkey,austria,3,113,Winter,1907
word im boarding a flight now so i wont be able to place orders until later not really sure that support would stop me from dying anyway so im pretty indifferent as long as italy loses,1,True,-4,austria,turkey,3,114,Winter,1907
i know its late notice but could you poke greece to cut support of bul,1,True,4,turkey,austria,3,115,Fall,1908
sorry for not responding or doing anything i was in a place i thought i would have service but did not for 5 days good luck defeating the tyrants,1,True,-5,austria,turkey,3,116,Spring,1909
ah i fell on my own sword last season anywaymisclicked when placing my orders üòÇ,1,True,5,turkey,austria,3,117,Spring,1909
good game austria happy trails,1,True,5,turkey,austria,3,118,Spring,1909
you too,1,True,-5,austria,turkey,3,119,Spring,1909
whats the play mate something i can help with,1,True,1,france,austria,3,0,Spring,1903
whats shaking bacon you allied with italy or just in  a hopeful nonaggression until they stab you in the back agreement,1,True,0,austria,france,3,1,Spring,1907
more the latter though at this point im likely to just invite him into my dots üòÄ,1,True,0,france,austria,3,2,Spring,1907
well as one who was in a previous agreement with italy i would recommend either striking first or moving your units to cover your front  italy will turn as soon as you leave a good opportunity,1,True,0,austria,france,3,3,Fall,1907
italy stabs you in the back what a shock,1,True,0,austria,france,3,4,Winter,1907
might i recommend striking back with your last dying breath join me and destroy italy,1,True,0,austria,france,3,5,Winter,1907
i invited him in england has been my bigger issue,1,True,0,france,austria,3,6,Spring,1908
disgusting,1,True,0,austria,france,3,7,Spring,1908
so im proposing a northern triple you me and germany roll down the rest of the board and then call a threeway draw its a good route because its a pretty stealthy alliance early on it looks like an eg taking on france and russia just acting normally how does that sound to you,1,True,1,russia,england,3,0,Spring,1901
i would hop on board with that if germany does,1,True,-1,england,russia,3,1,Spring,1901
ill let you know what i hear from germany,1,True,1,russia,england,3,2,Spring,1901
ok sounds good ill be upfront with you i had already proposed a western triple but neither have replied so if germany replies to the northern triple first then france can die hehehehe laughs evily,1,True,-1,england,russia,3,3,Spring,1901
any word from the germans yet i have reason to believe he is already communicating with the italians and doesnt reply to me,1,True,-1,england,russia,3,4,Spring,1901
i havent gotten anything from anyone but you,1,True,1,russia,england,3,5,Spring,1901
apparently our alliance is selfestablishing lol,1,True,-1,england,russia,3,6,Spring,1901
ive now heard a bit from italy but nought from germany,1,True,1,russia,england,3,7,Spring,1901
a triple alliance with italy is sounding a bit better in this situation wouldnt you say,1,True,-1,england,russia,3,8,Spring,1901
id be quite on board with that as well it wouldnt really change my opening moves,1,True,1,russia,england,3,9,Spring,1901
true that,1,True,-1,england,russia,3,10,Spring,1901
so about scandinavia  sweden for you and norway for me im guessing,1,True,-1,england,russia,3,11,Spring,1901
thats the traditional way to do it as long as germany doesnt get dickish,1,False,1,russia,england,3,12,Spring,1901
if he does that just solidifies my suspicions,1,True,-1,england,russia,3,13,Spring,1901
so army huh,1,True,0,russia,england,3,14,Winter,1901
uh yea  classic opening besides we wouldnt want france to get suspicious,1,,0,england,russia,3,15,Winter,1901
wish you had mentioned something if you were going to be uncomfortable with it my spring moves were regular old classic as well,1,,0,england,russia,3,16,Winter,1901
last thing we need is for the rest of the map to get suspicious of the north triplets,1,True,0,england,russia,3,17,Winter,1901
silence is uncertainty and uncertainty is hard to work with man,1,True,0,england,russia,3,18,Spring,1902
sorry about that crazy last few days for me im gonna build an army in stp to keep up appearances but im still board with the northern triad,1,False,0,russia,england,3,19,Spring,1902
what appearances might those be you already attacked turkey,1,True,0,england,russia,3,20,Spring,1902
and gonna build is future tense i already see what you built so that text being out of context strikes me weird,1,True,0,england,russia,3,21,Spring,1902
right yes sorry i brainfarted im playing russia in another game and also doing a northern triad there and that game is slightly behind this one in years got the games mixed up in my head,1,False,0,russia,england,3,22,Spring,1902
its a hassle and a half sorting them out sometimes,1,False,0,russia,england,3,23,Spring,1902
that is a brainfart for sure lol,1,True,0,england,russia,3,24,Spring,1902
anyway having reoriented myself im not going to do anything with stp ive got a hold order in and ill move it out of stp once i see youre not coming my way i figure its not a big longterm loss or anything because its pretty quick to get it back down south,1,True,0,russia,england,3,25,Spring,1902
ok i  look forward to seeing it,1,True,0,england,russia,3,26,Spring,1902
i dont have time to chat unfortunately so well catch up next season,1,True,0,england,russia,3,27,Spring,1902
ill be honest tho youve given off a very sketchy vibe from the get go  so i will be establishing a strong base in scandinavia whenif i see stp move south indicating  youre true intentions i can then begin to ease up on our borders thank you for understanding and i hope you have a good night or good day hehe whichever corresponds to you,1,True,0,england,russia,3,28,Spring,1902
i mean i certainly understand what youre thinking here but if you start moving more into scandinavia thats going to be a problem and a big imminent threat to me id much rather see a status quo here where neither of us makes an approach against the other,1,False,0,russia,england,3,29,Spring,1902
lets see that hold order and then well talk again,1,True,0,england,russia,3,30,Spring,1902
good morning sir  i did have just a couple mins to get on  just want to give you a heads up that i will attack stp with nwy since your issuing a hold order nothing will come of it other than keeping up much needed appearances as you said,1,True,0,england,russia,3,31,Spring,1902
good to know,1,True,0,russia,england,3,32,Spring,1902
i like keeping things above board,1,True,0,england,russia,3,33,Spring,1902
so you decided to opt for a western triple instead of a northern,1,True,0,russia,england,3,34,Fall,1902
yea i wasnt left with much of a choice,1,True,0,england,russia,3,35,Fall,1902
i left you with plenty of choice and youve got plenty of fleets to go after france,1,True,0,russia,england,3,36,Fall,1902
i wouldve loved to  try the northern but our stars just didnt align,1,True,0,england,russia,3,37,Fall,1902
not the way the diplomacy worked out i didnt have much choice the uncertainty was to overwhelming,1,True,0,england,russia,3,38,Fall,1902
hey im here im talking its not too late to turn around nao is right there the channel is right there,1,True,0,russia,england,3,39,Fall,1902
man i hear you but at this point i need to at least grab stp wouldnt you say,1,True,0,england,russia,3,40,Fall,1902
it wouldnt be fair  if i didnt,1,True,0,england,russia,3,41,Fall,1902
i dont think you do plenty of stuff you can do without it you want sweden i could support you into sweden,1,True,0,russia,england,3,42,Fall,1902
you still there bro,1,True,0,england,russia,3,43,Fall,1902
yep,1,True,0,russia,england,3,44,Fall,1902
sorry i fell asleep on you lol,1,True,0,england,russia,3,45,Fall,1902
ill take you up on your offer for sweden man,1,True,0,england,russia,3,46,Fall,1902
problem is to do that you wouldnt be able to defend stp and youd be going out on a limb that im not sure you are willing to lol quite the pickle,1,True,0,england,russia,3,47,Fall,1902
,1,True,0,england,russia,3,48,Fall,1902
i fell asleep on you in turn im not good at sleep schedules yeah im going out on a limb but i want us to work together,1,False,0,russia,england,3,49,Fall,1902
ugh this decision is harder for me than for you apparently lol,1,True,0,england,russia,3,50,Fall,1902
weird how ive put myself in a position that you could be the one to betray me lmao,1,True,0,england,russia,3,51,Fall,1902
question has germany been in contact with you,1,True,0,england,russia,3,52,Fall,1902
nope ive reached out but no response,1,True,0,russia,england,3,53,Fall,1902
yea very quiet on my end as well its hard to work with silence,1,True,0,england,russia,3,54,Fall,1902
why were you so sketchy at the beginning,1,True,0,england,russia,3,55,Fall,1902
like apparently offering everybody alliance and such,1,True,0,england,russia,3,56,Fall,1902
i feel like youre only wanting to work with me now cuz youre squeezed,1,True,0,england,russia,3,57,Fall,1902
do you truly want to be my ally,1,True,0,england,russia,3,58,Fall,1902
well ive found that with russia the goal is to piss off as few people as possible because if a bunch of powers are annoyed at russia you wont last long as for right now yes i absolutely do want to be your ally because i think russiaengland is a very strong longterm alliance,1,True,0,russia,england,3,59,Fall,1902
youve got a lot of really easy paths to expansion that dont go through me and ive got a lot of paths to expansion that dont go through you plus youve got a friendship going with france and theres a german right between us that we can definitely handle together to our mutual longterm benefit,1,True,0,russia,england,3,60,Fall,1902
hmm guess you went to hard trying to be friendly and it backfired badly from what i hear all your neighbors are gunning for you which would make me the target also if i do side with you  but now you seem so cool,1,True,0,england,russia,3,61,Fall,1902
yea i hear you on all of that believe me im aware of the board state,1,True,0,england,russia,3,62,Fall,1902
ill get back with you on a for certain about sweden i trust my word means something to you by now,1,True,0,england,russia,3,63,Fall,1902
it does,1,True,0,russia,england,3,64,Fall,1902
very good i just need to make sure i know exactly what germany is doing this turn,1,True,0,england,russia,3,65,Fall,1902
i will let you know whether im with you or against you,1,True,0,england,russia,3,66,Fall,1902

i was thinking about how they gonna know we allied if you support me,1,True,0,england,russia,3,76,Fall,1902
fair enough ill put the support order in,1,True,0,russia,england,3,77,Fall,1902

basically just hey you wanna work together,1,True,1,russia,turkey,3,2,Spring,1901
ill certainly consider it do you have any specific requests in mind regarding the balkans and black sea,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,3,3,Spring,1901
id rather we didnt bounce in the black sea  if you move your fleet to constantinople then you can get it out into the mediterranean really quickly to both of our benefits,1,True,1,russia,turkey,3,4,Spring,1901
im not sure i know you well enough yet to just hand you the black sea though whats in it for me,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,3,5,Spring,1901
rumania ill support you in,0,False,1,russia,turkey,3,6,Spring,1901
if you want me to have rumania and presumably you dont want to take any of my holdings what use is it to be in the black sea anyway,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,3,7,Spring,1901
im imagining your being in rumania as a shortterm trustbuilding sort of thing youre in there for a year maybe two tops and you get builds from that that allow you to build more fleets to flood the med and i get the longterm comfort of not worrying about you going to bla once we start picking up italianaustrian dots we can trade rumania back to me to keep some parity going,0,True,1,russia,turkey,3,8,Spring,1901
im tentatively on board with this agreement but i will let you know definitively when ive heard back from our pastry and opera loving neighbor,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,3,9,Spring,1901

well if you try to take it i must admit i‚Äôll bedifficult,1,True,-1,turkey,england,3,83,Spring,1905

what level of difficult are we talking and in what way,1,True,1,england,turkey,3,85,Spring,1905

that‚Äôs alright i prefer honest nastiness to dishonest courtesy,1,True,-1,turkey,england,3,92,Spring,1905
haha very true,1,True,1,england,turkey,3,93,Spring,1905
which makes honest courtesy the ideal world in which case i would ask that you consider making an exception with moscow for me as that would keep our borders very simple,1,True,1,england,turkey,3,94,Spring,1905
our borders are simple now you have countless avenues for expansion france for instance,1,True,-1,turkey,england,3,95,Spring,1905
i take it you have already made a deal with germany and austria for mos,1,True,1,england,turkey,3,96,Spring,1905
ive made arrangements that factor in russia working with you but im not going to say more,1,True,-1,turkey,england,3,97,Spring,1905

yea i did make a blunder back there had to take a couple steps back to regain my balance,1,True,1,england,turkey,3,102,Fall,1905

yes im good with that,1,True,0,england,france,3,10,Winter,1901
did germany message you about the dmz,1,True,0,england,france,3,11,Winter,1901

got it üòÄ,1,True,0,france,england,3,22,Fall,1902
well thats not really what i expected whats the play from here,1,True,-2,france,england,3,23,Spring,1903
its not what i wanted either but it was that our turn the whole board against us  ppl were already catching wind of it western triple ,1,True,2,england,france,3,24,Spring,1903
and had i continued my russian assault then turkey wouldve been unstoppable  nothing really changes for you however,1,True,2,england,france,3,25,Spring,1903
well i wouldve pushed on burgundy and tyrolia if youd given me a heads up but cest la vie,1,True,-2,france,england,3,26,Spring,1903
i wanted to give you a heads up but gotta admit there was risk in that  i wasnt sure you wouldve exactly seen it the way i did lol,1,True,2,england,france,3,27,Spring,1903
but its ok you can stay focused on italy if you want  i can handle germany,1,True,2,england,france,3,28,Spring,1903
eh italys slow until austria decides to stop propping him up  no reason not to move one army up to burgundy  i can always say its because im concerned about your aggression,1,True,-2,france,england,3,29,Spring,1903
ok sure thatll be nice,1,True,2,england,france,3,30,Spring,1903
in that case youd like munich right,1,True,2,england,france,3,31,Spring,1903
i mean i wouldnt turn it down,1,True,-2,france,england,3,32,Spring,1903
ok then mun is yours,1,True,2,england,france,3,33,Spring,1903

the channel has rough waters but i  think i can survive lol,1,True,2,england,france,3,37,Fall,1903
ya know england doesnt typically try to screw the guys he talked into the triple for a couple years when theyre nice and buried on other fronts,1,True,-2,france,england,3,38,Fall,1903
i did make a huge blunder in an attempt to put the brakes on turkey ill own that,1,True,2,england,france,3,39,Fall,1903
no redemption for us i guess,1,True,1,england,france,3,40,Spring,1904
theres always room for redemption,1,True,-1,france,england,3,41,Spring,1904
what would that look like this turn,1,True,1,england,france,3,42,Spring,1904
at least a ceasefire and i can pull my armies out of your lands,1,True,1,england,france,3,43,Spring,1904
i hear italy is trying to plot against me if you agree to a ceasefire i promise to pull armies out of your lands,1,True,1,england,france,3,44,Spring,1904
or actually use one of them to help you get mar back in the fall seeing as mar will fall this spring,1,True,1,england,france,3,45,Spring,1904
although if you can give me an ounce of trust that i will move out then youd be free to use bre and par units for the retaking of mar let me know what you want to do for right now i will pull my pick army back out into my island,1,False,1,england,france,3,46,Spring,1904
to be honest im not going to be in a very trusting mood this turn but if i see some backing off i will happily refocus on italy,1,True,-1,france,england,3,47,Spring,1904
totally understand bro pic is going to wales and nao holding,1,False,1,england,france,3,48,Spring,1904
if that happens i should be in a good position to lock up italy from further gains,1,True,-1,france,england,3,49,Spring,1904
right  its in my best interest to leave you in peace,1,True,1,england,france,3,50,Spring,1904
you shall see in a couple hours ,1,True,1,england,france,3,51,Spring,1904
so how are we feeling brotha,1,True,1,england,france,3,52,Fall,1904
feeling fine hoping were truly disengaged at this point  i am not in any way pushing on you this turn,1,True,-1,france,england,3,53,Fall,1904
ok great and yes absolutely disengaged im conveying wales to nwy gonna havta put the brakes on turkey from the north or were all screwed,1,True,1,england,france,3,54,Fall,1904
my army in bel is doing nothing  i could help you retake  marseilles if youd like,1,True,2,england,france,3,55,Spring,1905
i think im good there üôÇ,1,,-2,france,england,3,56,Spring,1905
very well,1,True,2,england,france,3,57,Spring,1905
assuming youre suggesting walking bel through bur  which would be hilarious but i dont think actually helps much with marseilles,1,True,-2,france,england,3,58,Spring,1905
how would it not help that would give you  4 units to italys 3,1,True,2,england,france,3,59,Spring,1905
there are only three land spaces next to marseille i have two armies that can move to two of those spaces and a fleet in the third  there are no other spaces to put a helping army üòÄ,1,True,-2,france,england,3,60,Spring,1905
oh well if youre using both of your units there then yes theres no room for mine im just saying with  mao backfilling spain then spain could go to mar with double support and succeed in which case i guess i could backfill mao to keep italy out,1,,2,england,france,3,61,Spring,1905
if i may ask where are you from bro seems like our timezone dont mesh very well,1,True,2,england,france,3,62,Spring,1905
i see,1,True,2,england,france,3,63,Spring,1905

well two reasons 1 its defensive keeps you from getting a support on me  and doesnt look like itll spoil anything else youd be doing 2 helps hide the real reason for moving to ruhr,1,True,-3,france,england,3,101,Spring,1906
just curious was all yea that sounds fun,1,True,3,england,france,3,102,Spring,1906

hello italy i chose you as the first country to message to try to figure out the truthlie setup,1,True,0,austria,italy,5,0,Spring,1901
all right i see how it works now  anyways im sure we both know how italy can be at the start of the game having trouble expanding quickly but right on the border with trieste making austria a tempting target,1,True,0,austria,italy,5,1,Spring,1901
i firmly believe that italyaustria is one of the most fruitful alliances possible in the game if we work together early we can be dominant against turkey giving you complete naval supramacy over the mediterranean and highly favoring us over rt in a fight in the balkans,1,True,0,austria,italy,5,2,Spring,1901
i happily await your response ,1,True,0,austria,italy,5,3,Spring,1901
hi austria an alliance between us sounds good look forward to working with you,1,False,0,italy,austria,5,4,Spring,1901
sounds good do you mind letting me know your plans for venice this turn a move to piedmont would give me great peace of mind,1,True,0,austria,italy,5,5,Spring,1901
ill probably keep the army in venice for the time being perhaps we could have tyr as a dmz between us,1,True,0,italy,austria,5,6,Spring,1901
all right understood hope we can work together,1,True,0,austria,italy,5,7,Spring,1901
i look forward to it,1,True,0,italy,austria,5,8,Spring,1901
just for full transparency im going to be going to tyr this turn not as a move against you though,1,True,0,italy,austria,5,9,Spring,1901
hmm im not thrilled about that what are you doing with the unit in rome,1,True,0,austria,italy,5,10,Spring,1901
heading up to piedmont,1,True,0,italy,austria,5,11,Spring,1901
okay so you plan to use tyrolia against munich then,1,True,0,austria,italy,5,12,Spring,1901
not necessarily against them just to have a unit on the border,0,False,0,italy,austria,5,13,Spring,1901
frankly im not very interested in letting you do that id prefer venice hold,1,True,0,austria,italy,5,14,Spring,1901
im sure you would,1,True,0,italy,austria,5,15,Spring,1901
ok i should let you know then that i will be moving triestevenice nothing personal of course i just need to make sure my border is safe,1,True,0,austria,italy,5,16,Spring,1901
it was mainly to keep germany on edge youd have though i wouldnt have told you as youd have obviously moved on venice  i will remain in venice for now though,1,True,0,italy,austria,5,17,Spring,1901
well in my opinion germany is one of our strongest possible mutual allies in the north so id prefer if you didnt move on him either i know im being difficult and i apologize but as austria at this point in the game i have to try to stay as guarded as possible,1,True,0,austria,italy,5,18,Spring,1901
since germany seems to be afk id be open to you moving on tyrolia so we can work together to consolidate munich and berlin before the northern powers get there,1,True,0,austria,italy,5,19,Fall,1901
okay ill be moving to tyr this turn,1,False,-1,italy,austria,5,20,Spring,1902

thats you me and austria,1,True,-1,italy,russia,5,3,Spring,1901
yup we go in hard dig out turkey then you go after france austria goes after germany and i go after scandinavia and england or you and i turn on austria and crush him between us either way you and i make perfect natural allies,1,True,1,russia,italy,5,4,Spring,1901
sounds like a plan,1,True,-1,italy,russia,5,5,Spring,1901
hey there hows it going,1,True,0,england,italy,5,0,Spring,1901
morning england all very quiet so far you heard much,1,False,0,italy,england,5,1,Spring,1901

anything to that effect on your end,1,True,0,england,italy,5,3,Spring,1901
ah just gone 0830 here ive only spoken with austria so far and they seem worried with a rustur alliance  i must say that i think france will need to be curtailed as they can often spiral out of control,1,,0,italy,england,5,4,Spring,1901
well all our neighbors are certainly dangerous p do you have something in mind to keep france down specifically,1,True,0,england,italy,5,5,Spring,1901
probably worth seeing where they move to begin with,1,True,0,italy,england,5,6,Spring,1901
yea fair enough,1,True,0,england,italy,5,7,Spring,1901
hi italy i think we should at least touch base since we share a neighbor,1,True,0,turkey,italy,5,0,Spring,1901
have you had any contact with austria yet,1,True,0,italy,turkey,5,1,Spring,1901
weve been in touch,1,True,0,turkey,italy,5,2,Spring,1901

going to see the opening moves and see where we can go from there,1,True,0,italy,turkey,5,4,Spring,1901
i hope we have some basis for a mutual understanding now,1,True,0,turkey,italy,5,5,Fall,1901
russia also stabbed me,1,True,0,turkey,italy,5,6,Fall,1901
aye i imagine its to do with the black sea,1,True,0,italy,turkey,5,7,Fall,1901
i plan on moving to greece this turn as thatll give me a foothold to help you against austria,1,True,0,italy,turkey,5,8,Fall,1901
sure ill need to reconsider what to do with the black sea,1,True,0,turkey,italy,5,9,Fall,1901
have you heard from austria,1,True,0,turkey,italy,5,10,Fall,1901
talk to me if we dont work together austriarussia will win,1,True,1,turkey,italy,5,11,Winter,1901
austria is hoping that ill move against germany with him which could give us a chance to hit him as he pushes north,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,5,12,Winter,1901
hm im thinking i need to sacrifice bul or move to greece with your support,1,True,1,turkey,italy,5,13,Spring,1902
once i clear out the black sea i can then go back to bul and support you in,1,False,1,turkey,italy,5,14,Spring,1902
this seems like an excellent opportunity for them to do a supported move onto bul with albgre to block my escape,1,False,1,turkey,italy,5,15,Spring,1902
if youre okay with that i can move a bul  gre with your support and withdraw from bul for a second,1,True,1,turkey,italy,5,16,Spring,1902
by the way he can move f alb  adr at which point it will become very hard to attack tri,1,True,1,turkey,italy,5,17,Spring,1902
i want to give you sufficient space to get tunisia or greece maybe,1,False,1,turkey,italy,5,18,Spring,1902
but of course i dont want to get overwhelmed here either,1,True,1,turkey,italy,5,19,Spring,1902

i dont have an intention of moving to tyrolia or anywhere near munich at any time in the near future if ever so id like to hear that you have a similar mentality towards our relationship,1,True,0,austria,germany,5,1,Spring,1901

what would you propose from here,1,True,0,germany,england,5,3,Spring,1901
id say we can take on russia pretty well together  i can go north to take stp by 02 or 03 and you can bounce them out of swe and id support you in in the coming years from there id try to march my armies south on the eastern edge of the board you could go through the middle towards austria and france can be swinging south through italy in the meantime,1,True,0,england,germany,5,4,Spring,1901

hey germany looks like you missed the first turn but what are you plans for the future,1,False,0,turkey,germany,5,0,Fall,1901

hello russia im highly interested in working with you as austria i strongly believe in the necessity of acquiring a strong early alliance and who better than a partner who can help me keep down turkey ,1,True,-1,austria,russia,5,0,Spring,1901
the first clear point between us is dependent on how we want to arrange the balkans and of course the typical sore point between us in galicia i would be interested in hearing your thoughts on both of those,1,True,-1,austria,russia,5,1,Spring,1901
id much rather neither of us worry the other about galicia it makes no sense to even feign a fight the single most important thing that italy russia and austria can do for their future success on a board in my opinion is not have a turkey extant if the three of us work together and coordinate it properly turkey will fall fast,1,False,1,russia,austria,5,2,Spring,1901
turkey hasnt said anything to me just yet,1,True,-1,austria,russia,5,3,Spring,1901
so what moves are you planning seems tough to go hard against turkey so early,1,True,-1,austria,russia,5,4,Spring,1901
as long as you me and italy all go in and coordinate turkey wont be able to stand up to us,1,True,1,russia,austria,5,5,Spring,1901
im trying to trick turkey to let me into the black sea,1,True,1,russia,austria,5,6,Spring,1901
as austria i am slightly worried that any alliance that includes us 3 will result in me being the odd man out once turkey has been removed,1,True,-1,austria,russia,5,7,Spring,1901
fwiw i dont plan on that at all once were done with turkey you can run in on germany i can run in on scandinavia and england and italy can run in on france then we call a threeway draw bing bang boom,1,False,1,russia,austria,5,8,Spring,1901
fair enough let me know if you manage to let turkey into bla,1,True,-1,austria,russia,5,9,Spring,1901
so galicia huh,1,True,1,russia,austria,5,10,Fall,1901
i was expecting you to move there yourself you seemed very flippant about bouncing there and i was worried that you werent going to keep your word now i look like a backstabber  sorry,1,True,-1,austria,russia,5,11,Fall,1901
hey im gonna cover my shit so i wont actually lose anything long as you move back out were cool,1,True,1,russia,austria,5,12,Fall,1901

no problem at all,1,True,2,russia,austria,5,17,Fall,1902
so what shall we do here,1,True,3,russia,austria,5,18,Spring,1903

so far theyve promised me theyre not going for a juggernaut but pretty much every russia would say that,1,True,0,england,austria,5,3,Spring,1901
they also told me they wanted to go after turkey early have you heard anything about that cuz if not id have to think hes being sneaky ya,1,True,0,england,austria,5,4,Spring,1901
russia said the same to me,1,True,0,austria,england,5,5,Spring,1901
ah ok thats a bit reassuring at least,1,True,0,england,austria,5,6,Spring,1901

hi austria im not against an armenia opening but im not sure i can commit as of yet in what way can you assist,1,True,0,turkey,austria,5,2,Spring,1901

i certainly agree have you had any dialogue with germany or italy yet,1,True,0,france,austria,5,1,Spring,1901

not quite sure yet to be honest  still trying to get to know the board,0,True,-1,england,russia,5,1,Spring,1901
any ideas on your end,1,True,-1,england,russia,5,2,Spring,1901
my inclination is to focus south i wont put an army in stp you dont put an army in norway fair deal,1,True,1,russia,england,5,3,Spring,1901
that sounds good to me,0,True,-1,england,russia,5,4,Spring,1901
i just hope youre not planning a juggernaut  then itd be almost irresponsible of me to not do anything ya,1,True,-1,england,russia,5,5,Spring,1901
otherwise tho ill be more than happy to just leave each other be ya,0,True,-1,england,russia,5,6,Spring,1901

great glad well be able to work together then,0,True,-1,england,russia,5,8,Spring,1901
well germany crippled himself a little bit there which is nothing but good news for us,1,True,1,russia,england,5,9,Winter,1901
im planning to build a fleet in st petes south coast to really drive the knife home on germany but i will gladly change that if you want,1,True,1,russia,england,5,10,Winter,1901
just to emphasize there  south coast,1,True,1,russia,england,5,11,Winter,1901
thats sounds ok to me though i honestly think we have more than enough naval presence already and a land attack from warsawmoscow could be promising,1,True,-1,england,russia,5,12,Winter,1901
but if you want another fleet just for your own peace of mind i understand completely of course,1,True,-1,england,russia,5,13,Winter,1901
all good thus far anything we need to check up on,1,True,1,russia,england,5,14,Fall,1902
yep i think we just kie and ber right  i guess one question is  if i take kie with den would you be ok taking ber with bal  that way we can keep our borders a bit less militarized yknow,1,True,-1,england,russia,5,15,Fall,1902
you got it,1,True,1,russia,england,5,16,Fall,1902

sorry about the stab man  i was just real scared about any more fleets coming out of stp,1,True,-1,england,russia,5,18,Fall,1902
i mean im picking up 2 dots and only losing one so i can still build were not actually at a dealbreaker here as long as you dont take sweden and you leave that fleet in the north coast i can live with it,1,True,1,russia,england,5,19,Fall,1902
alright thanks for your understanding i would like that arrangement,0,True,-1,england,russia,5,20,Fall,1902
so what shall we do here,1,True,0,russia,england,5,21,Spring,1903
im debating between securing hol and swinging down right away into eng what do you think,0,True,0,england,russia,5,22,Spring,1903
i think that now is your best chance to actually get into eng so i would do that if i were you,1,True,0,russia,england,5,23,Spring,1903
hm yea probably  i guess once im in eng i can get hol or bel in the fall too anyways,0,True,0,england,russia,5,24,Spring,1903
alright ill go for that then,0,True,0,england,russia,5,25,Spring,1903
yeah exactly im going to get an army into berlin if that doesnt bother you that will let one of us get into munich in the fall,1,True,0,russia,england,5,26,Spring,1903
if youd rather i didnt ill refrain,1,True,0,russia,england,5,27,Spring,1903
im ok with the army into berlin but with my fleet in kie i probably cant help too much with taking mun,1,True,0,england,russia,5,28,Spring,1903
but if you can get support from someone else yea go for it,0,True,0,england,russia,5,29,Spring,1903
sigh i keep trying to point you towards dots that are both easier to get and more beneficial to your long term vitality and yet,1,True,0,russia,england,5,30,Spring,1903
you are a strong and scary lad,1,False,0,england,russia,5,31,Spring,1903

hello brother turk whaddya say we just steamroll this board full juggernaut no funny business get your fleet out pop mine roll the board i like picking an ally early on and sticking with them and i want it to be you,0,True,1,russia,turkey,5,0,Spring,1901
hi russia i do think an alliance between us would be ideal  i plan to do a fairly standard opening and we can work from there,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,5,1,Spring,1901
what do you think are we good to proceed,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,5,2,Spring,1901
yep ill send sevastopol to rumania you send ankara to constantinople and we can juggernaut this,0,False,1,russia,turkey,5,3,Spring,1901
im not sure im ready to commit on the black sea yet though what do you say we bump there for the first year,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,5,4,Spring,1901
i mean i feel like its a pretty big waste of time because theres a huge tactical momentum advantage to getting your fleet out but if you insist then we can bounce,0,True,1,russia,turkey,5,5,Spring,1901
what do you suggest i do with my fleet then,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,5,6,Spring,1901
if you go to constantinople in the spring and then the aegean in the fall youll be able to build a second fleet to put yourself in the ionian or at least hold the ionian under threat and youll have two on greece to get your fifth dot,0,True,1,russia,turkey,5,7,Spring,1901
if i can do that i wouldnt mind helping you out getting rumania and deploying a unified western front,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,5,8,Spring,1901
eastern front,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,5,9,Spring,1901
that sounds perfect to me,0,True,1,russia,turkey,5,10,Spring,1901
ok lets do it,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,5,11,Spring,1901
an unfortunate unfolding of events,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,5,12,Fall,1901
if you pull out of bla ill reconsider where we stand but otherwise i can only view it as a hostile action,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,5,13,Fall,1901
i will absolutely pull out it must have taken an older version of my orders before we agreed on not bouncing sorry about that,0,False,1,russia,turkey,5,14,Fall,1901
so what is your plan for the next turn,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,5,15,Fall,1901
black to sev sev to rum ukr to war bot to swe,0,False,1,russia,turkey,5,16,Fall,1901

bad move now youve let moscow open to england,1,,-3,turkey,russia,5,18,Fall,1903
if i look at the state of the board maybe we should reconsider allying,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,5,19,Winter,1903
yeah we probably should this is a bloody mess,1,False,2,russia,turkey,5,20,Winter,1903
im pulling syria off the board,1,True,2,russia,turkey,5,21,Winter,1903
thank you ill develop towards austria to keep pressure off you if you want we can stab a together,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,5,22,Spring,1904
sounds good to me ive gotta cover my ass right now but as soon as i can ill help you work on austria,1,True,2,russia,turkey,5,23,Spring,1904
just fyi im still taking bla because i havent completely forgotten the past few years,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,5,24,Spring,1904
to show that i dont have hostile intent i used arm so that i cannot pressure sev for now,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,5,25,Spring,1904
i appreciate that,1,True,2,russia,turkey,5,26,Spring,1904
but i do need to exit through bul,0,True,-2,turkey,russia,5,27,Spring,1904
thank you for your trust could you support a hold on serbia so i dont get push out from there,1,True,0,turkey,russia,5,28,Spring,1905
i plan to move into greece with bul,1,True,0,turkey,russia,5,29,Spring,1905
you got it,1,True,0,russia,turkey,5,30,Spring,1905
looks like a forgot to input commands,1,True,0,turkey,russia,5,31,Spring,1905
bit of a lucky break for us,1,True,0,russia,turkey,5,32,Spring,1905
sure yeah,1,True,0,turkey,russia,5,33,Spring,1905
im still worried about f  e,1,True,0,turkey,russia,5,34,Spring,1905
italy is basically gone,1,True,0,turkey,russia,5,35,Spring,1905
if a crumbles to us then f will probably gain a few more too,1,True,0,turkey,russia,5,36,Spring,1905
and its clear f is readying for a naval assault on me as well,1,True,0,turkey,russia,5,37,Spring,1905
i hope you will find a way to handle england but it seems like lvn could retreat to war and cause trouble,1,True,0,turkey,russia,5,38,Spring,1905
again could you help me defend ser ill move my fleet out of bla to counter france,1,True,0,turkey,russia,5,39,Fall,1905
ack sorry about that for the record you are welcome and encouraged to take sev i would much rather you have my dots than england,1,True,-3,russia,turkey,5,40,Winter,1905
i wanst generally planning on stabbing you but to develop the theatre vs austria i needed this position once i get serbud i can move out of rum again,1,True,3,turkey,russia,5,41,Winter,1905
its kind of timesensetive since f will be moving up really quick i think,1,True,3,turkey,russia,5,42,Winter,1905
if i hadnt taken rum id estimate entering a stalemate vs a while f conquers italy and moves up on austria,1,True,3,turkey,russia,5,43,Winter,1905
so im considering going for sev or i can try to support your last stand hehe,1,,6,turkey,russia,5,44,Winter,1906
lol üëè,1,,10,turkey,russia,5,45,Winter,1908

great  sounds good,1,True,0,england,turkey,5,2,Spring,1901
hey england looks like ill be pitted against russia for the game so if you want to work together that would be awesome,1,True,0,turkey,england,5,3,Fall,1901
ill definitely see what i can do  with russia getting into sweden for free thats not good for either of us,0,True,0,england,turkey,5,4,Fall,1901
yeah did you talk to germany or are they just away,1,True,0,turkey,england,5,5,Fall,1901
ive heard from them i think they just werent used to the interface or something,1,True,0,england,turkey,5,6,Fall,1901
hm alright lets hope they make up for it then,1,True,0,turkey,england,5,7,Fall,1901
do you have any plans to go for stp,1,True,0,turkey,england,5,8,Fall,1901
i probably will tho i think swedenll come first,1,True,0,england,turkey,5,9,Fall,1901
depends on pressure of germany but taking nwy will put you adjacent to stp forcing his hand,1,True,0,turkey,england,5,10,Fall,1901
yea for sure,1,True,0,england,turkey,5,11,Fall,1901
wow both you and france are off to great starts,1,True,-1,turkey,england,5,12,Spring,1902

im really not too sure the brest build has me kinda nervous tbh,0,True,1,england,turkey,5,14,Spring,1902
f did have three builds i can see why f would notwant to waste it and they kind of dont have anywhere to go but through germany italy or you,1,True,-1,turkey,england,5,15,Spring,1902
best to convince them that germany is the right choice given the prominence of russia  austria,1,True,-1,turkey,england,5,16,Spring,1902
thats the plan yea  well see how it goes anyways,1,True,1,england,turkey,5,17,Spring,1902
how are things on your end of the continent,1,True,1,england,turkey,5,18,Spring,1902
seems russia  austria are pretty close im hoping austria will get uncomfortable being so open to a russia stab at least or their alliance falls apart,1,True,-1,turkey,england,5,19,Spring,1902
now the question is if that happens before or after i get waltzed over,1,True,-1,turkey,england,5,20,Spring,1902
italy doesnt seem too competent not sure,1,True,-1,turkey,england,5,21,Spring,1902
yea lol,1,True,1,england,turkey,5,22,Spring,1902
russias looking kinda scary to be honest,1,True,1,england,turkey,5,23,Spring,1902
their board setup is on point atm they may have some weakness if you can get 3 fleets to stp but thats about it,1,True,-1,turkey,england,5,24,Spring,1902
maybe if germany wakes up,1,True,-1,turkey,england,5,25,Spring,1902
tbh im not sure austria should allow russia to gain more ground,0,True,-1,turkey,england,5,26,Spring,1902
me and france should be able to hold them in north if france doesnt end up stabbing me at least but they could definitely get out of control if austria slips up ya,1,True,1,england,turkey,5,27,Spring,1902
the way its looking were going to have to work together against france,1,True,-2,turkey,england,5,28,Winter,1905
what makes you say that,1,True,2,england,turkey,5,29,Winter,1905
well f wins when they get 16 centers they will get 1 from italy that is 12 then mun tyr are fairly easy 14 you see where im getting at,1,True,-2,turkey,england,5,30,Winter,1905
ah its 18 actually,1,True,-2,turkey,england,5,31,Winter,1905

i‚Äôm down what did germany say,1,True,0,france,england,5,1,Spring,1901

dmz the channel,1,True,0,france,england,5,4,Spring,1901
i agree with the dmz  i definitely think we can pull the western triple off,1,True,0,england,france,5,5,Spring,1901
especially with this chat format itll be hard for our opponents to easily coordinate an opposition,1,True,0,england,france,5,6,Spring,1901
let‚Äôs march east,1,True,0,france,england,5,7,Spring,1901
great glad were on board ,1,,0,england,france,5,8,Spring,1901

let‚Äôs swoop in,1,True,0,france,england,5,10,Fall,1901
ok yes lets capitalize on this,1,True,0,england,france,5,11,Fall,1901
would you be ok building an army in brest and ill do the same in london just so we keep the channel well and truly dmzd,1,False,-1,england,france,5,12,Winter,1901
what are we thinking for builds,1,True,-1,england,france,5,13,Winter,1901
i want to build 2 fleets to hold the med a stab here would be horrible for me i don‚Äôt need to give you any reason to ally with germany again let‚Äôs do this together my man i think you should also build a fleet in london if it makes you feel more comfortable,1,True,1,france,england,5,14,Winter,1901
ok thats fair  i think ill hold off on the fleet in london for now i dont think germany is sure im stabbing them yet,1,True,-1,england,france,5,15,Winter,1901
what we thinking,1,True,1,france,england,5,16,Spring,1902
i think ill try to get into hel and convoy something in in the fall or what do you think,1,True,-1,england,france,5,17,Spring,1902
why don‚Äôt you tap kiel and i support you in to holland,1,True,1,france,england,5,18,Spring,1902
oh good idea yea,1,,-1,england,france,5,19,Spring,1902
id go with that if youre ok with it,1,,-1,england,france,5,20,Spring,1902
wait actually getting into hel might be more important in the spring cuz we can still go for hol in the fall and hel will help hold den and go for kie,1,,-1,england,france,5,21,Spring,1902
i guess maybe we should also consider going after russia just cuz theyre getting really strong at the moment and if they build anything else in the north well basically never have a shot at getting through later,1,,-1,england,france,5,22,Spring,1902
idk let me know what you think,1,,-1,england,france,5,23,Spring,1902
id take your support from lon to hol this turn if youre still ok with giving it,1,,-1,england,france,5,24,Fall,1902
with germanys second nmr that changes things up a bit,1,True,1,france,england,5,25,Fall,1902
i would feel much more comforatble putting a fleet there instead of army,1,True,1,france,england,5,26,Fall,1902
i would support north sea or hel in if you want,1,True,1,france,england,5,27,Fall,1902
actually how are you thinking we should carve germany,1,True,1,france,england,5,28,Fall,1902
do you want to take kiel and berlin and i can take holand and munich  i can keep an army in holland to make you more comfortable,1,True,1,france,england,5,29,Fall,1902
that sounds fair to me,1,True,-1,england,france,5,30,Fall,1902
should i support you in or i should i start our attack on russia,1,True,-1,england,france,5,31,Fall,1902
yes please i could use the fleet in marseilles to take the med,1,True,1,france,england,5,32,Fall,1902
whoops,1,True,1,france,england,5,33,Fall,1902
answers you too late,1,True,1,france,england,5,34,Fall,1902

alright sounds good to me üëç,1,True,-1,england,france,5,37,Fall,1902
also what are your thoughts on builds next year the presence of a fleet in mao is kinda scary on my end cuz it can always stab to iri but if you feel like you need it there for your own protection i understand completely and i can just build something to sit around holding down the fort on my end,1,True,-1,england,france,5,38,Fall,1902
not sure about builds  i would like another fleet in the med  the only reason i saty in mao is because youre in north sea  im happy to move out if you willcan,1,False,1,france,england,5,39,Fall,1902
ok thats fair i guess its kind of hard for england to do much of anything without a fleet in nth so i guess your fleet in mao will stay,1,True,-1,england,france,5,40,Fall,1902
so ill go ahead and support you bel‚Üíhol then,1,True,1,england,france,5,41,Spring,1903
tho it might also make sense to use kiel to make sure russia cant do ber‚Üíbal pru‚Üíber cuz that could get me in some trouble i think,1,True,1,england,france,5,42,Spring,1903
anyways let me know what you think we should go for,1,True,1,england,france,5,43,Spring,1903
you could support me with north sea unless you planned on moving outta there,1,True,-1,france,england,5,44,Spring,1903

north sea is kinda how i convoy my armies to where i need to go tho,1,True,0,england,france,5,58,Fall,1904
this is kind of a weird thing to say but i think i need to point out that this is a good opportunity to stab me from a tactical perspective with a a fleet build in bre you can keep me out of eng while walking into lvp  that being said i think we still have a lot to gain by working together as we stand we are certainly stronger than any other pair of nations and we probably have fighting chances against the rest of the board even if they all united against us in the near future even you are closing in on breaking the italian resistance and i am close to doing the same for russia  divided however i believe the victory of either of us will be much less guaranteed what with so much of our resources focused solely on each other,1,True,-1,england,france,5,59,Winter,1904

italy boungiorno  thankfully we have switzerland as a buffer but i wanted to reach out to see where your head was at  have you heard from france  turkey  austria  even russia  you and i  along with austria really have to watch all sides  depending on how initial conversations go obviously id love to have a good relationship on our border potentially a napdmz  im looking forward to hearing what youre thinking about the early game and the game generally   kaiser,1,,0,germany,italy,6,0,Spring,1901
no thoughts on the early game  information i can provide or vice versa  i havent heard much from you and austria and i cant decide if thats bad news or i just dont matter much to your plans,1,,0,germany,italy,6,1,Spring,1901
okay interesting first move  i dont know if youre not talking to me or not talking at all but i did want to float a thought or two by you  i dont know if you coordinated with russia at all and note that im on good terms with him  either way he strikes me as an experienced player  as such its weird that he would open aggressively at both austria and turkey dont you think  theyd naturally see that and band together out of necessity  no im thinking hes working with turkey and well see f bla c a ankrum  thats nothing to you  austria dies faster but theyre grabbing the centers you bet very heavy to get  congrats on that by the way  always a gutsy move  but its not good news for you  because theyll need to move quickly so if thats happening id also expect f conaeg most likely followed by 2 fleet builds  con and smy  tell me im crazy  i hope im crazy anyway,1,,0,germany,italy,6,2,Fall,1901
hey hows it going im hoping we can work together in this one we have no reason to get in each others way and plenty we can do together let me know what you think,1,,0,austria,italy,6,0,Spring,1901
hello italy nice to make your acquaintance ill have to admit i was caught off guard by your entrance into trieste but i think it could work out well for you   i would like to ask if i will be bounced if i move to vie and if you have any other plans for the future that might be to both of our benefit,1,,1,russia,italy,6,0,Fall,1901

doh my initial spring 01 commo i had never selected an emoji for so it probably just sent now a turn late üôÇ,1,,0,turkey,italy,6,1,Fall,1901
anyway nice aggressive opening to trieste  i hope you sold it ahead of time as a key lepanto but either way lets carve the balkans quick so we can both head north and you can look to the west,1,,0,turkey,italy,6,2,Fall,1901
we should probably be talking by now,1,,-1,turkey,italy,6,3,Fall,1902
greetings italy  would you be up for a dmz in piedmont i think it would benefit both of us if we didnt go to war rn looking forwards to a great game france,1,,0,france,italy,6,0,Spring,1901

thinking of a leponto or hitting austria early,1,,0,france,italy,6,2,Spring,1901
hey italy i dont know if you have noticed but russia is huge rn and is about to crush both you and turkey and then proceed to run over the rest of the map idk how your relationship with turkey or italy is but you guys really need to work together to stop russia you dont seem like a very talkative type but its never to late to change,1,,-1,france,italy,6,3,Spring,1902
hello austria   look id love to be besties and all that and maybe well get there  but for now can i assume that we both have bigger fish to fry and that we both know that attacking each other early will mean mutually assured destruction  im open to a nonaggression pact possibly with sharing information natirally  outside of that let me know whats on your mind and well go from there  best   kaiser,1,True,0,germany,austria,6,0,Spring,1901
no thoughts on the start of the game  any information i can share or viceversa  youre pretty quiet down there,1,True,0,germany,austria,6,1,Spring,1901
i actually thought id responded sorry i dont know why we cant be best friends germany does well then austria can do well and vice versa not much frommy neighbours you got anything from italy,1,True,0,austria,germany,6,2,Spring,1901
nothing from you or italy until now  youll be shocked to learn that turkey mused about how much he loves to play germany and open to tyrolia  üòÇ  cant blame a guy for trying i guess  anyway for now im good with a short pact to stay out of tyrolia unless youve planned a bounce with italy or something but that would be weird  maybe limit it to 1901 for now  i dont have any plans in that neighborhood but i dont want to bind your hands if something comes up with russia or italy,1,True,0,germany,austria,6,3,Spring,1901
tyr 1901 for me would be pretty crazy and no i dont plan for it so im happy to agree to it ive got nothing from italy either so ill just have to play defensively there russia seems to be interested in opening north,1,True,0,austria,germany,6,4,Spring,1901
i wish i could say what can i do to help you but i have nothing in range  what i am doing is sowing some seeds of doubt with italy  floating the idea that russia and turkey are working together and backhandedly noting how bad it will be for him if they are and they wipe you out quickly  you have a best probabilistic set of moves but the best you can realistically hope for is maybe 1 build if you go greece serbia trieste  maybe  if i were you id reach out to italy  suggest that he take tunis and instead of forcing him out of trieste youll take greece and move on  tell him youre going to move to trieste because its your best move  it is  request that he move to vienna because thats russias best move it is and you want to prevent him from getting another build  youd move budtri and ser s albgre,1,True,0,germany,austria,6,5,Fall,1901
scenario 1 italy agrees 1a italy moves to vienna russia moves to vienna ukraine moves to galacia  none of those moves work and unless turkey and italy are working together or turkey inexplicably moves bulser you get greece and build in vienna  1b italy moves to vienna russia to budapest  youre in the same position but losing budapest instead of trieste  scenario 2 doublecross and italy thinks youre lying 2a italy moves to tribudapest and venicetrieste  russia gets vienna if it moves there nothing if to budapest 2b ven s tri h f ion  alb he thinks youre going to support yourself back into vienna you get greece russia gets vienna if it moves there nothing if it moves to budapest 2c tribud ventyr  bounces,1,True,0,germany,austria,6,6,Fall,1901
scenario 3 double cross italy believes you 3a tri holds support from venice thought you were truthful about budtri but left out that you were supporting yourself  that would be incredibly stupid on your part with russia at your back and intentionally antagonizing italy  here again it comes down to whether russia moves to vienna or budapest 3b iongre trivie ventyr he wont go to trieste if he thinks youre moving there because a bounce is as good as taking it you still take greece  you end up in trieste  you keep all 3 home centers if russia goes to vienna and 2 or lose budapest if he goes there 1  note if italy is coordinating with russia or turkey all this is out the window  but in that case youre hosed no matter what  hows that for more input than you wanted  sorry about that  anyway rough open  good luck on the recovery  even selfishly you getting beat up early is nothing but bad news for me,1,True,0,germany,austria,6,7,Fall,1901
i really am sorry about that spam  i started thinking about your situation playing it forward and taking a couple notes and then  i guess at a certain point it just seemed like a shame to waste it  ü•∫,1,True,0,germany,austria,6,8,Fall,1901
haha no worries my fault really russia tells me this grand plan of going north throws in a weird move in his plan with warsaw and i respond with the thumbs down youre lying on all fronts but then i dont play the appropriate moves to back it up i heard nothing from italy so assumed hed open standard shouldve just hedgehogged but i like getting a fast start with austria anyway russia is probably working with italy still havent heard back from them at all at least eng  fra dont look friendly for you but youre going to have russian problems pretty quickly,1,True,0,austria,germany,6,9,Fall,1901
still nothing from italy and russia cant build in warsaw without breaking his nap  you really need to be working with turkey  i told him the same thing  i can put pressure on italy by pressuring france  but look for transparency if youre sunk and im in position im interested in eating your centers  i wont do it unless and until youre ready to call it though,1,True,2,germany,austria,6,10,Winter,1901
when youre thinking about your moves plan on me moving to tyrolia  unless he supports himself in unlikely ill either bounce him or be there in the fall  if you want to brainstorm on moves and i can do the same with turkey let me know  if youre not sure if you can trust me consider  if you go down early im sunk  yes i want to be involved so ill be in position to gobble you up so that russia cant  but for what its worth i promise i will help you unless you think its hopeless,1,True,2,germany,austria,6,11,Spring,1902
and ill be transparent about it either way,1,True,2,germany,austria,6,12,Spring,1902
looks like the cossack bit off more than he can chew  he should be either 1 or 2 in the south this year  from what i can see you  turkey can lose the guessing game with any move set except one  any way i can help,1,True,2,germany,austria,6,13,Fall,1902
to both austria and turkey  in case you want to play with it heres the sandbox  httpswwwbackstabbrcomsandbox5637073032183808  i cant solve it  heres what i know 1 we have to assume italy is working with russia  so my tyrtri is a lock 2 we have to assume that russia takes ankara 3 barring very unusual moves the only place we can possibly rumania from is budapest  exception to this is a sneaky rumbul move but thats unlikely 4 almost sure that vienna has to hit galacia but depending on other moves supporting budapest is almost as good,1,True,2,germany,austria,6,14,Fall,1902
russia is friendly with turkey now too so we cant assume ank falls although likely considering how russia is playing,1,True,-2,austria,germany,6,15,Fall,1902
their play has been very weird indeed  it looked like a classic pretend stab then a real one then the double support last season  but it looked the last turn was you and turkey working together and him getting fed up with the russoturkish mess  ill be more careful though,1,True,2,germany,austria,6,16,Fall,1902
hello germany nice to make your acquaintance   ive been thinking about this game alot because the fact that it will only last until 1910 really changes my strategy add in that no one is likely to nmr and i believe it will be near impossible to solo   normally when playing russia i try to grab a couple german centers around 1904 allowing me to hold over the stalemate line setting up a solo when i conquer the east since im not intending to solo in this game however it doesnt make sense to go after your centers it would be much better for both of us i believe to agree to a pact of non aggression i could even offer some help against england if there came a time when you wished that what do you think,1,False,1,russia,germany,6,0,Spring,1901
interesting points  ive been thinking about how the format and time limitation might change the game as well  for transparency england reached out to me as well and generally i think germany working with england is in a vacuum the best course  im fine with a nonaggression pact but we need to set pretty clear ground rules  im significantly more vulnerable than you  interested in each of us setting up a proposal and see how well they match,1,,-1,germany,russia,6,1,Spring,1901
how about a commitment to something like the following through spring 2003  we can revisit or extend from there and of course any of these are subject to specific agreement otherwise   total dmz in sil  pru  no german units in bot or lvn  germany concedes sweden but only to be occupied by fleets  no russian units in bal  no army builds in berlin  no army builds in stp  notify before a build in war  what do you think,1,True,-1,germany,russia,6,2,Spring,1901
i agree to all of those points  just to be clear england is not necessarily a target of mine but if necessary i can act as an insurance policy against english aggression for you,1,False,1,russia,germany,6,3,Spring,1901
by the way for whatever its worth i am hearing talk coming back to me that you are looking to open north  again its spring 01 so talk is pretty cheap  but just thought id flag it for you,1,True,-1,germany,russia,6,4,Spring,1901
talk is cheap and after spring resolution you will see that i fully intend to abide by our agreement   the fact that you brought this up with me really builds trust with me i did tell austria that i was heading north west but obviously that is a lie i hope that you see it to be in your best interest to keep that confidential because i truly do intend to work with you all the way through 1910,1,True,1,russia,germany,6,5,Spring,1901
well what do you think about how the spring went  looks like it couldnt have gone too much better for you  you have the drop on both austria and turkey  which makes me think you dont  you strike me as too good a player to not understand that opening heavy against both of them forces them to join forces which means a nasty stalemate  therefore im smelling a slingshot  soconaeg and a bul s a russian bla c a ankrum  or maybe support from ukraine while bul takes a shot at greece  are you and italy going to coordinate moves so you dont bounce each other,1,True,-1,germany,russia,6,6,Fall,1901
sorry i missed your message its been a wild week at work  i hesitate to give away too much detail but i will be very clear in stating that i intend to focus on my southern sphere of influence for the foreseeable future   it does look like you and england will likely have france cornered by 1902 england doesnt really have any where to go after that happens other than your centers and a few of mine i just want you to know that its critical for my sgame to have you holding back any threats coming in from the north and ill offer you any support that i have available in the north when necessary,1,False,1,russia,germany,6,7,Fall,1901
it was a very nice open for you,1,,-1,germany,russia,6,8,Fall,1901
it seems youll have to focus south what with the clear lucypullingthefootballawayfromcharliebrown that just occurred at the black sea  where do you plan to build  we agreed no builds in warsaw and no armies in stp  so it seems you should have a second fleet in the north to help with england  unless youre planning to defer,1,True,-2,germany,russia,6,9,Winter,1901
i had toyed with asking permission for warsaw but after evaluating more it will be moscow f nc stp and sevastopol   and yeah the south is chaos right now but its controlled chaos,1,True,2,russia,germany,6,10,Winter,1901
well weve been more or less jockeying for position huh  i hate to do this but i want to give you a heads up that i have to break our agreement and end our nap a season early  its not what i planned or intended but right now this game will turn either way on a dime  you played the beginning of the game beautifully but gained so much so fast that you not only forced austria and turkey into an alliance but england and i as well  so much so that we let france up off the mat too  and i kinda hate you for that because i really hate allying with england as germany and i had france absolutely wrecked  i expect to enjoy playing this out with you either way  and im fascinated to see how this fall goes in the southeast  what a tangled mess both the tactics and the diplomacy  best  kaiser,1,True,-2,germany,russia,6,11,Fall,1902
i appreciate the honesty i would like to propose an alternative use this turn to get the drop on england then you turkey and i can take this all the way to a three way draw in 1910 turkey and i have been working together closely since the opening move but weve covered it well turkey has the remnants of austria and italy to fight and you have the west to conquer i can help you both without putting myself close to a solo ive shown myself to be a trustworthy ally to you and i truly mean it when i say that i want us to have the lions share of the spoils in 1910 a three way alliance between you turkey and i makes perfect sense strategically,1,False,2,russia,germany,6,12,Fall,1902
so i dont think thats going to happen  i recognize the risk i run with all allies at my back but such is the life of the kaiser who does not eliminate at least one of france or england  i choose to play this game with much more trust than most  in this particular case i dont have a ton of choice in the matter,1,True,-2,germany,russia,6,13,Spring,1903
your ally isnt going to be much help if they fail to enter orders i can support you into sweden this fall in exchange for some minor concessions we could probably even get you into the north sea simultaneously,1,True,2,russia,germany,6,14,Spring,1903
i cant believe you didnt sniff out the livonia convoy  i was figuring it was a 50 chance of going through  or maybe its what you wanted me to do,1,True,-2,germany,russia,6,15,Spring,1903
i was more concerned with losing norway to be honest ive kind of retreated into a posture thats more defensive than it probably should be but if you and england are going to present a united front i really cant do anything else except to hope that a you reconsider your alliances or b england decides to stab you my least preferred option,1,True,2,russia,germany,6,16,Fall,1903
id like to present another thought for you lets assume that you and england continue to push against me and turkey begins to wrap up italy quite possible considering that turkey is likely to get into the ionian this turn   because i must move all units northward to defend against eg im absolutely forced to leave my southern border undefended if turkey grows to 12 or 13 centers they could easily roll up my southern centers and solo this whole thing  i hope im not coming off as beating a dead horse here but it makes so much sense for us to be aligned   1 a grt alliance can be easily balanced until 1910  2 i am already positioned to help you against england 3 englands nmr means they are an unstable ally for you but might make it easy for you to gain their centers quickly 4 forcing me to defend in the north invites a turkish solo 5 i have already proven myself to be a trustworthy ally by abiding the agreement set forth at the beginning of the game  i enjoy playing with you and i really desperately want to work with you for game and for personal reasons,1,True,2,russia,germany,6,17,Fall,1903
you cant reasonably have had hope to keep norway through the year under almost any circumstances  even as it turns out with an england nmr  youre fundamentally correct and italy is a wild card in this thing for sure  and i would enjoy playing this one out with you as well  but it might have to be smack talk  if youre concerned about a potential continental caliphate show me  support tyrtri  im not saying im going to make that move  i might  but ill take it as a strong sign that youre serious about us working together and about the turkish threat,1,False,-2,germany,russia,6,18,Fall,1903
that was a very rough turn for you if you want to negotiate im open i could make things easier for you in the south in exchange for help against england in the north,1,True,1,russia,germany,6,19,Spring,1904
it was a rough turn for both of us i think  given my current situation there isnt a worse possible play for me than antagonizing england assuming hes not already aligned with france  hes made no move to show me that he is or isnt  what i can do is work to make england see that if france cant be trusted trying to force his way in through stp is a death sentence growth will be too slow france will have to circle back for him and his forces will be committed to that logjam in the northeast  i should be able to convince him to convoy to belgium and thats his only army  should give you plenty of breathing room  ill try to convince him to focus on france  selfserving but probably in his best interests anyway  ill be in touch,1,True,-1,germany,russia,6,20,Fall,1904
i just wrote the following to england,1,,-1,germany,russia,6,21,Fall,1904
so that was interesting  im actually not that bad off as long as france and russia arent coordinating and more importantly as long as you arent with france  since clearly france cant be trusted and obviously hell have to come for you at some point to go for the win maybe a convoy to belgium is in order  you can hold stp easily get 2 builds prevent france from getting any and change the balance of power pretty dramatically  if you really trust france you could also convoy to holland and take a stab at crippling me permanently  hell get 1 or 2 youll get 2  though you risk bouncing with france if he gets greedy  but if he builds and you see a f mar youre in for a rough go  if its me convoy to belgium is the smarter play  i dont even see it as a stab on your end  our alliance was threeway and it is broken  if you werent in on it its broken for all of us,1,,-1,germany,russia,6,22,Fall,1904
pt 2 in either case its probably not a great idea to try to force your way into russia via stp  youve got it and can hold it easily  theres a reason its part of the stalemate lines  you need to grow as fast as you can or youre just waiting for a knife  i was waiting for turkey to stab russia to give you an opening  it didnt come so i tried to force it and opened myself  but if turkey stabs now hell collapse too quickly for you to get or at least get with any chance to defend more than one more center  i would strongly consider figuring out lines and conditions with russia so you can both dedicate your forces elsewhere  and i say that knowing that a highly likely place for russia to dedicate forces is at me  but since the second most likely and possibly first is at turkey which takes a partner from france its worth the risk  whats on your mind,1,,-1,germany,russia,6,23,Fall,1904
wrap up as i look at what i just wrote i am going to cutpaste it to russia to facilitate discussions among the three of us,1,,-1,germany,russia,6,24,Fall,1904

would you like to work together,1,True,0,england,germany,6,0,Spring,1901
depends on what youre thinking  as germany i think england makes the most sense as an ally  regardless of how the early game goes i have to deal with some combination of england france and russia within a few years  france and russia can help against england but  not against each other while england can help against both of the other two  im definitely open to working together but my main questions for you what does your contact with france or russia look like  are you looking for a 3party alliance or just two  whats your initial vision of how this will go especially considering the 1910 deadline,1,True,0,germany,england,6,1,Spring,1901
i have reached out to france and am hoping for a threeway alliance between us i have not spoken with russia and he has not spoken with me either  i see myself going through scandinavia and northern russia yourself going through southern russia and austria and france will take the mediterranean,1,True,0,england,germany,6,2,Spring,1901
im not closed off to the possibility but im not thrilled at the prospect of an alliance with both you and france  if with you id much prefer that we split scandinavia and then you focus on the atlantic and med  if you land armies in russiawell that makes me an easy stab while the reverse is not even close to true  the concern about you flowing through russia also explains my concern with the egf combo except even more so  im not trying to be contrary but i dont have the luxury of setting my back against a wall like you do,1,True,0,germany,england,6,3,Spring,1901
by the way have you heard anything from france,1,True,0,germany,england,6,4,Spring,1901
you bring up some very good points im willing to team up against france,1,False,0,england,germany,6,5,Spring,1901
also france has offered a dmz in the english channel,1,True,0,england,germany,6,6,Spring,1901
france wants me to bounce in burgundy and is acting i assume all upset that i might move to the ruhr  what if i offered you denmark  fleet only no convoy   for the first season only  id take it back in 1902 barring something unexpected  but if youre in the channel and north sea this spring you could convoy into france while i take holland and belgium  brest and both iberian centers are yours  well figure out norway sweden paris and marsailles based on how this shakes out  my spring would be kiehol munruh bermun  yours would be to eng  nth and sit with 1 build and an army in picardy presumably  what do you think,1,True,0,germany,england,6,7,Spring,1901

the incentivized lying makes me reluctant to believe you  but since thats true of everyoneim game,1,True,0,germany,england,6,10,Spring,1901
well what do you think about how the spring went  i wasnt psyched about the move to picardy but everything else in the west went fine  are you convoying to picbrest and taking norwaydenmark  austria is getting hit from all sides which is never good for germany and russia has the drop on both austria and turkey  im on good terms with him to protect my backdoor with a short nap but if he gets a quick jump it could be trouble  i was originally thinking you should convoy to france but im wondering if thats a long term problem  you might want to convoy to norway  im not trying to say whats best for you just thinking about the mid to longterm picture  definitely would like to hear your thoughts,1,True,0,germany,england,6,11,Fall,1901
also one other thought russia and turkey may be working together  i havent talked to them yet but id be very unsurprised to see conaeg and a bul s a russian bla c a ankrum  if theyre not working together that means russia opened hostile to both austria and turkey which is crazy because it basically forces them to band together  i might warn italy,1,True,0,germany,england,6,12,Fall,1901
what are you thinking for the fall,1,True,0,germany,england,6,13,Fall,1901
i was looking at his board and all i could think was that he has to have a build  that means he has to cover brest  take portugalspain  so you should be able to convoy to picardy  i think,1,True,0,germany,england,6,14,Fall,1901
that sounds good to me i will do  that,1,True,0,england,germany,6,15,Fall,1901
sothree builds for the cossack  this may be a problem  he approached me about making sure that i fend you off  that was interesting since all we have is a nonaggression pact  but note that part of our deal was that he cant build in warsaw  that means youll probably see f stpnc  im going to build a fleet to make sure we dont lose control of scandinavia  you may need to focus north more than planned  im not looking to take any more than demark and im not going to break my nap but i can get into denmark and the baltic and lock him down,1,True,1,germany,england,6,16,Winter,1901
i havent heard anything else from france but if i dont help austria this is going to be a very short game  were 2 turns in and austria and turkey are both on the mat  they can slow russia down if they work together  and it looks like they will  except italy is making that a problem  im hamstrung by my nap  i need to pressure italy to help austria  i was planning on doing it through france but that will be far too slow  tyrolia  likely bounce but it may buy some time  how do you want to handle france  dibs on paris and marsailles  we cant let him up off the mat but if you cant absorb russian attention were sunk  im planning f kiebal and a berkie then lock up denmark no matter what  but these next couple moves have to be perfect,1,True,1,germany,england,6,17,Spring,1902
ehhh im not sure what im going to do with that fleet actually  let me think about it and let you know  open to input  by the way if youre thinking of teaming up with russia or already have said germany looking at the build in the irish sea look at the board  he has a clear path to a solo and can cross the stalemate lines at stp right now so theyre of no concern  he already has you 21 in the north and turkey and austria will both be russian by the end of 1903  he told me hes not looking to solo because itd be too hard to do with the 1910 limit  with a big early jump the smart money says that thought turns into seeing it as a challenge,1,True,1,germany,england,6,18,Spring,1902
can you please have your a pic s belbur,1,True,1,germany,england,6,19,Spring,1902
nm about that either actually  nothing is quite right yet,1,True,1,germany,england,6,20,Spring,1902
yeah im not entirely sure what to do at the moment russia contacted me about leaving each other alone so the fleet in stp is somewhat of a surprise im thinking i move from eng to nth and moving  lvp to iri  im willing to support bel to but if you change your mind about that were in a tough position though,1,True,-1,england,germany,6,21,Spring,1902
i know its late  but if you bump paris and move engmao you assure brest in the fall since i can move to paris to break any support,1,True,1,germany,england,6,22,Spring,1902
france just contacted me he believes that we should all work to stop the obviously powerful russia he suggested working with you to get pic south but i dont think that will work very well do you have any ideas,1,True,-1,england,germany,6,23,Spring,1902
what i think you should do is move eng to nth convince germany to let you move belyou wouldnt be taking it though just moving through and then convoy bel to nwy where you could really fight russia  from france,1,True,-1,england,germany,6,24,Spring,1902
what do you think about that plan,1,True,-1,england,germany,6,25,Spring,1902
ive been talking with france  as i said id like to walk away from him  give him the iberian recommend that he build to go to the med,1,True,1,germany,england,6,26,Spring,1902
as you know i have my suspicions that youre working with russia  nature of the game  so im not psyched about having you waltz through belgium in a position to support a hold or misorder or even move to holland  that said im open to some very fast brainstorming,1,True,1,germany,england,6,27,Spring,1902
thats understandable something else we might do is destroy my unit in pic so i could build an additional fleet but that wouldnt be viable until the fall,1,True,-1,england,germany,6,28,Spring,1902

i didnt like that at first but after further consideration i do  youre not going to be convoying anywhere just yet  im thinking you stay in belgium but support helden from the north sea and have f ska s bal c kieswe  the only way he stops that isif he  has norway supports sweden holding i think  or uses sweden to support norway to ska i guess  but in that case he still loses sweden and you retreat to bal,1,True,1,germany,england,6,37,Spring,1902

yup  okay gotta run now,1,True,1,germany,england,6,39,Spring,1902
i think something that would work better is if you took swe with bal that way i could break the support in nwy with nth and you could take den with either hel or kie what do you think about that,1,True,-1,england,germany,6,40,Fall,1902
hmm  he knows he cant save sweden so he may be resigned to losing it  assume thats true and also that he doesnt think well bother to support into norway because we cant take it  what does he do,1,True,1,germany,england,6,41,Fall,1902
i desperately want to convoy but its fall so if he gets a build it will benot futile but less impactful  right now in the south hes 1 in austria  hes facing a guessing game on whether hell be 2 there but most likely hell be 2 in the area and 1 in turkey  then 1 in norway to offset  i dont see any way he gets a build  that being the case the value of a lvn is far more than a build for me and a disband for him  both of us will be even as will he  but a lvn demands 3 units to defend  it cripples him in the balkans and since i can break his support from stp we lock down all of scandinavia next year,1,True,1,germany,england,6,42,Fall,1902
alright lets do that then you convoy to lvn and i support hel to den,1,True,-1,england,germany,6,43,Fall,1902

russia is reaching out to me about turning on you  i assume the reverse is also true  dont buy it  the reality is that hes totally on the ropes right now  scandinavia is lost to him and with france and i starting to pressure italy and austria about done turkey is already matching his 7 centers and in a much better position both to grow and to stab  i misread the turkey relationship  alarm bells were going off but that was a helluva lot of trust for a game that is supposedly blind  given that im not confident that it is blind we have to assume that theyre acting as one power  all of which is just a mush of thoughts but i want to pass them to france as well to spur discussion  i dont want him to feel left out and get antsy  especially when he has to build at brest,1,True,0,germany,england,6,59,Winter,1902

okay so this year we need to lock norway down ideally with a british army make sure france is fully on board figure out whats up with italy and penetrate east  i think the clearest thing is that you take norway in the spring and from sweden  he cant stop it and with my denska hes left only with a retreat to bal  youd then need to get the army in there in the fall  we position in the spring and do the same with a convoy in the fall as well  but to do that you need to stay in sweden which isnt a good use of a fleet  as it stands italy can legitimately be in the channel by winter,1,True,0,germany,england,6,62,Spring,1903

im sandboxing the mess you guys have down there  heres the thing russia is going to add a center in the north and he cant get a build  so yall need to have him net no better than 1 down there  since we have to assume hes going to take ankara you need to take two centers in austriabalkans  i think i have a solution but i need to stress test  it will need my tyr for sure  ill be in touch with both of you soon,1,True,1,germany,turkey,6,8,Fall,1902
are we looking at the same game  if you and england coordinate youre guaranteed to deny him a build up north as you can force  sweden,1,True,-1,turkey,germany,6,9,Fall,1902
yes but until i worked through the stuff down hear thats not what we were going to do which is the reason it was so critical  as long as he wouldnt be able to build we would temporarily pass on sweden for stronger position  him building makes it not a stronger position  and so,1,True,1,germany,turkey,6,10,Fall,1902
man nothing look a good convoy to livonia to wreck someones day,1,True,1,turkey,germany,6,11,Spring,1903
i was sure hed smell it and counter  i was floored to see it go through,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,6,12,Spring,1903
hes been struggling a bit with tactics this game honestly that was part of the reason i was so willing to accept his offer of an outofthegate juggernaut,1,True,1,turkey,germany,6,13,Spring,1903
im not sure i believe that,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,6,14,Spring,1903
shrug  no worries just making small talk  i do like your position now though,1,True,1,turkey,germany,6,15,Spring,1903
i didnt mean that as hostile and i only meant the first part  hes either been really good or really lucky from what ive seen,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,6,16,Spring,1903
he got pretty lucky in the opening  some of the tactical discussions have been questionable  otoh theres the other really important fact that ive actually had discussions with him  total freaking radio silence from england and italy and not much more than that from france or austria  this has been a really nontalkative board for the most part,1,True,1,turkey,germany,6,17,Spring,1903
italy has spoken to no one as far as ive heard  england isnt very talky  france is but weve had less to talk about really  i had to convince him that moving to mao and leaving spain open was the smart play just now and of course it took some convincing that i was going to just walk away from the blitzkrieg lines i opened up with  thats probably natural,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,6,18,Spring,1903
probably  and he does seem to be fairly committed to the med at this point  me tapping tri instead of doing the army rotation i actually wanted to do might actually help convince him to keep going as it means hes going to end up winning the race for italian dots if he pushes on  you look in pretty good shape to be honest  france moving mostly away from you all kinds of position on russia and an england prone to not moving youre pretty much all opportunity right now üôÇ,1,True,1,turkey,germany,6,19,Spring,1903
my back door is open i need to get france a build and we have a serious problem controlling the atlantic  hey want to support me into trieste,1,False,-1,germany,turkey,6,20,Spring,1903
ugh you would hit that right as i was crashing let me wake up and check map,0,True,1,turkey,germany,6,21,Fall,1903
im not saying i necessarily want to move to trieste  but italy is a problem for everyone right now just in terms of resolution  and the radio silence,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,6,22,Fall,1903
righto we do need to take the random element off the board  not out of the question my only hesitation is that it further accelerates what send to be your massive breakout opportunity here  doesnt look like you need a lot of help ballooning up to monster size right now otoh your borders are kinda brittle at the moment until you get a couple builds in,1,True,1,turkey,germany,6,23,Fall,1903
yes  all that is true  hey speaking of ballooning out to monster size you had a nice year  just sayin,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,6,24,Fall,1903
since youre on to italy anyway any chance you want to take trieste,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,6,25,Fall,1903
i did but that will is almost dry and yes im happy to take trieste given the current positions if nothing else changes at most i get one italian for after that so next build trieste is probably time to turn north i assume that works well for you too,1,True,1,turkey,germany,6,26,Fall,1903

good morning france  i wanted to reach out to you to see where your mind is at initially  i also wanted to let you know up front that unless something changes i will be moving to ruhr  im not worrying about belgium at this point but i do want to ensure that i have holland locked down  most importantly this isnt intended as hostility towards you  with that out of the way whats going on so far  have you heard from italy england or russia  what are you hoping for early,1,False,0,germany,france,6,0,Spring,1901
checking back in with one more question would you prefer to plan a standoff in burgundy  im not excited about it but im open to it,1,True,0,germany,france,6,1,Spring,1901
hi germany   bounce in burgundy sounds good but your move to ruh idk not really liking that holland is guaranteed to you winter 1901 no matter if you have ruh or not the main reason you would move it there in 1901 would be to take belgium and then move in on me it feels pretty antifrance hopefully we can work something out and maybe even arrange an alliance against england about that have you heard anything from them i havnt   looking forwards to a good game france,0,True,0,france,germany,6,2,Spring,1901
yes england reached out to me and asked if i was interested in an alliance of the three of us  i told him i wasnt as that rarely ends well for germany  i told him i was definitely interested in allying with one of you but not both  im not a big fan of a bounce in burgundy  its kind of a fear maneuver that puts both of us behind overall  its nice on your end since it functions as your defense and frees up marsailles  speaking of marsailles  nothing from italy  i havent heard from him yet,1,True,0,germany,france,6,3,Spring,1901
what would the rest of s01 look like with the burgundy bounce,1,True,0,germany,france,6,4,Spring,1901
so what are you going to do about ruhr the rest of s01 really depends on where we want this to go do you want a full on alliance against england or just an agreement of dmzs and who gets what territories,1,True,0,france,germany,6,5,Spring,1901
nothing from italy,1,True,0,france,germany,6,6,Spring,1901
if you dont want to do a bounce where would munich go im planning on moving to burgundy because i dont really have anywhere to move it in the spring and i dont 100 trust you,1,False,0,france,germany,6,7,Spring,1901
its probably best that you dont 100 trust me  thats kind of the game we play  we trust those we shouldnt and doubt those we should trust  im moving to ruhr which isnt considered to be antifrance generally  holland isnt garaunteed to me unless i pass on denmark  moving to the ruhr or successfully to burgundy which i assume you wouldnt like is the only way to ensure holland without fkiehol  if youre moving to burgundy that will pretty much cast the die i guess  honestly if you havent heard from italy you might take that as a cue to be nervous  he has every reason to want to come to an agreement with you  you still havent heard from england either,1,True,0,germany,france,6,8,Spring,1901
enland isnt talking that much they have communicated to me about an alliance with you but i feel like they arnt that involved in this game and wouldnt be a good ally for this reason i think we should work together to take them out,0,True,0,france,germany,6,9,Spring,1901
i thought you were going to bounce me oh well i know im in bur rn and that is generally considered an  antigerman position but i dont really want to fight you since i have my hands full w england  do you want to try to take out england i could support ruh into belgium if you were willing to support me sometime in the future,0,False,0,france,germany,6,10,Fall,1901
i said i was moving to ruhr  how could i have moved to burgundy as well  not only did i say i was moving to ruhr i said that it wasnt considered to be an antifrencb move and that if you moved to burgundy the die would be cast  im a little surprised that was somehow unclear,1,True,0,germany,france,6,11,Fall,1901
look i opened the game gunning for you which was nothing more than a strategic choice  i actually was kind of bummed about it  you seem more into the game and more talkative both of which i like  but things change  looking around russia  with whom i have a nap expiring in the fall  is about to crush austria and turkey at once which will makd him essentially unstoppable  based on the build in the irish sea england is certainly not preparing to box him in up north never mind pressure him  he may be working with him  as far as i can tell italy isnt talking to anyone but jumped on austria as well  i need austria to provide some resistance at the very least and so do you  you run the risk of losing without ever engaging with your conqueror  to me thats always the worst way to lose,1,True,1,germany,france,6,12,Spring,1902
lets talk and soon  you got a build and still have spain there for a second  if we can make peace you can dig in  italy is the key to this imo,1,True,1,germany,france,6,13,Spring,1902

well what are you going to do,1,True,-1,france,germany,6,21,Spring,1902
germany i understand you want me to help with this russia thing but the truth is your a lot closer to russia than i am and frankly i cant completely trust that you wont attack me,1,,-1,france,germany,6,22,Spring,1902
thats what im trying to figure out  what i want to do is move to tyrolia you move to marsailles and the piedmont and we make sure britain cant stay on the continent  but my default course since we havent been able to connect is to come at you hard and make sure i get my builds on my back door,1,True,1,germany,france,6,23,Spring,1902
tough spot,1,True,1,germany,france,6,24,Spring,1902

are you going to,1,,-1,france,germany,6,27,Spring,1902
let me ask you  assume my moves were tactical and that the strategically correct thing is to walk away right now  big leap of faith for both but especially for you  that said look back and youll see that ive done nothing but deal straight with you,1,True,1,germany,france,6,28,Spring,1902
tell me youre in and that youll move burmar then to pie and ill believe you make the leap of faith and order muntyr  support me in belgium in case england double crosses  ill move to the north sea,1,,1,germany,france,6,29,Spring,1902
im willing to do it of course it probably isnt a good move in the short term as i dont completely trust you but nobody is going to win in the short term either so yes i would do it but i cant support you in belgiam since im moving bur but anyways i actually think you should work with englnad and let them move to bel where they could convoy away next turn to nwy which would really be a pain for russiawhich would be good for us,1,True,-1,france,germany,6,30,Spring,1902

why are you not getting spain  a mar s maospasc is a lockdown  personally id be more worried about doing that and seeing f wesmao  but then lifes a gamble  plus with austria in the ionian and me in tyrolia im not sure hell be going on distant explorations right now  you might even consider skipping the support  run f maospasc and a marpie  not the safest but it has a certain swagger to it  and sadly im not above that being a tiebreaking factor  ü§®,1,,1,germany,france,6,64,Spring,1902
thoughts on the fall  spain i assume  nice break that austrias in the ionian which should open up a path for you  im not sure what to do with my a ruhr and im open to suggestions  if you do end up supporting from mar how do you feel about tyrpie  im not saying ill do it but its an option  not a great option but still,1,,1,germany,france,6,65,Fall,1902

tyr could support that move or try for viena triest or venice,1,True,-1,france,germany,6,67,Fall,1902
i would probably move ruh to kiel there arnt really any great options if england turns on you you might be able to get denmark back and from kiel you can always convoy,1,True,-1,france,germany,6,68,Fall,1902
or you could move to munich where you have  access to a lot of stuff,1,True,-1,france,germany,6,69,Fall,1902
any thoughts on what i could do with paris rn im thinking  a bur  mar f mao  spasc a mar  pie,1,True,-1,france,germany,6,70,Fall,1902
and then paris could go to burgundy could hold could move to gascony or could move to picardy and then we could work out a convoy and basically send it anywhere,1,True,-1,france,germany,6,71,Fall,1902
which of those do u lke,1,True,-1,france,germany,6,72,Fall,1902
as much as id love to see you in piedmont you risk missing a build from spain unless you support yourself in,1,True,1,germany,france,6,73,Fall,1902

not sure about paris  piedmont will be open in the spring  with me in tyrolia italy needs his a ven in the east,1,True,1,germany,france,6,75,Fall,1902
russia is reaching out to me about turning on you  i assume the reverse is also true  dont buy it  the reality is that hes totally on the ropes right now  scandinavia is lost to him and with france and i starting to pressure italy and austria about done turkey is already matching his 7 centers and in a much better position both to grow and to stab  i misread the turkey relationship  alarm bells were going off but that was a helluva lot of trust for a game that is supposedly blind  given that im not confident that it is blind we have to assume that theyre acting as one power  all of which is just a mush of thoughts i shared them with england as well to spur discussion  by the way what are your plans at this point  you need to get into the med in a hurry of course  britain may be able to bring a fleet around to help after the next year or so  ive got an army im able to dedicate kinda  im expecting a push west from warsaw now,1,,0,germany,france,6,76,Winter,1902

hey germany everybody vastly overreacted worrying that i was going to go for the solo since i had 11 centers even though i clearly wasnt going to literally everyone teamed up against me reducing me to 9 and frankly i wouldnt be surprised if the attack continued  meanwhile turkey has gotten 12 centers and is in a great position‚Äîrussia is exposed and they are likely going to break through my defenses as well its more than likely that turkey is going for the solo just saying‚Äîif turkey wins its because all of u guys were selfish and ignored the bigger threat at hand on that note i hope turkey doesnt win and that we can come together to stop themmuch like you did to me btw i am sending this message to everybody hopefully we can work together to stop turkey,0,True,7,france,germany,6,96,Spring,1907

this game is probably over but we need to try,1,True,4,france,germany,6,104,Spring,1909

ok these moves are good but most of this doesnt even matter because this is the last season before the hard cap right now my orders are the same as the ones you said but munich is holding it makes more sense because if i got into boh i would lose munich,1,True,4,france,germany,6,108,Fall,1909
butwhat if he has boh support a move to munich from one of the other two  youre equally sunk  youre right of course  that is the one scenario thats a problem  its just that i think its the least likely  far less likely than boh providing the support for an attack  thats because we dont have a unit adjacent to bohemia so we cant break the support  unless youre going to double support munich we have to do it this way  elsewise if he double supports with one support from boh were toast and we have no way to know which of the supports we should hit,1,True,-4,germany,france,6,109,Fall,1909

greetings austria nice to make your acquaintance  this is definitely a unique game given the time constraints and high stakes i intend to strike northwest in an attempt to build a large fleet line extending across the north atlantic i need your cooperation to make this work however i need you to eliminate turkey as a threat and quickly so that i can turn my full attention north here is what i propose  i take rum but agree to take no centers south of rum spring 1901 i move a mosstp we both agree to a total dmz in gal fall 1901 i will move a war north i will use any available strength along my southern border to support you in taking the balkans and turkey throughout the game  i think if we can both maintain trust you and i can hold the majority of centers between the two of us in 1910 and well both walk out of this game with the spoils what do you think,0,False,1,russia,austria,6,1,Spring,1901

hey england sorry ive been so long in reaching out  just wanted to make it clear that i hold no ill intentions toward you and my moves spring 1901 should prove that i will absolutely not be moving a mosstp and id hope to consider you a welcome neighbor should you decide to take nwy in the future we each stand to gain little by meddling in each others business i would be happy to leave you to your business in the west while i play in my own sphere of influence  best wishes and good luck,0,True,1,russia,england,6,0,Spring,1901
hello turkey nice to make your acquaintance   ive been thinking about this game alot because the fact that it will only last until 1910 really changes my strategy add in that no one is likely to nmr and i believe it will be near impossible to solo as such it really only makes sense to find a ride or die partner for close tactical coordination and grab as many centers as possible  as im sure you know when rt can trust each other and are firing on all 8 the juggernaut can be nearly unstoppable you as turkey are my number 1 preferred partner in this game i propose that we ally to dominate the eastern sphere of this game do you agree,1,True,1,russia,turkey,6,0,Spring,1901
i mean who doesnt like a good juggernaut  always a fun start to the game    how do you like to play it  standard bounce in black then go our own way west or something a little fancier that requires a bit more trust  im of course partial to a plan that gets an army rather than a fleet in rum but other than that pretty open,1,,-1,turkey,russia,6,1,Spring,1901
i usually go with the bounce but due to the unusual nature of this game i would consider other openings if you would be willing to allow f sevbla i could support us both into a quick takeover of the balkans i understand that that move takes a lot of trust however so i am of course open to other suggestions,1,True,1,russia,turkey,6,2,Spring,1901
bounce is safer but rotation is more fun and its just a game lets do it,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,6,3,Spring,1901
nice have to take some time to think about this tactically but i think were in a good spot   im kind of surprised italy took trieste thats statistically a pretty bad move for italy,1,True,1,russia,turkey,6,4,Fall,1901
but a good move for us unless its a key  which it likely isnt because the moving the second fleet north hurts that opening  soumm  carry on i guess  youre pretty well guaranteed two builds,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,6,5,Fall,1901
alrighty then  looks like there will be no coherent defense from the west,1,True,-3,turkey,russia,6,6,Winter,1901
italy getting two builds concerns me a little bit i want to make sure that you gain two builds if possible in 1902 im worried that italy is going to throw two fleets at you and to be honest losing you would be crippling for my game  ive been toying with the idea of asking for an alliance of you germany and i to go to 1910 together i think its the only thing that makes strategic sense i can help you with italy and germany with england and all three of us can end up with 10 centers at the end of 1910  do you have any input on this idea,0,True,3,russia,turkey,6,7,Winter,1901
im ok with that  and his current issues aside france is a reasonable alternative to germany there  especially as i halfexpect englandgermany to pull back and react to your three builds  but im good either way  in any event yes i expect italy to drop two fleets and position on me  if austria were actually communicative id be trying to spin my positioning as protecting him but at the moment im talking to a wall  which is somewhat moot if we move fast enough  he shouldnt really have enough time to firm up a credible defense,1,,-3,turkey,russia,6,8,Winter,1901
sointerestingly i was having a conversation with the admin about why i would give an order for my army to be convoyed by your black sea fleet even though that wasnt ever something i asked for or discussed  and it makes me wonder  did you see that move as me sending a message and if so what message,1,True,-3,turkey,russia,6,9,Winter,1901
well i can tell you that it totally faked out germany  they think that i screwed you by not convoying and the jug isnt even on their radar at the moment in that aspect it was amazingly successful tactically its not a bad move keeping an army back offers you a little insurance against an armenian stab this year of course i wasnt stabbing anyway but insurance never hurts if you had gained two builds it would have left con and smy open to build fleets in good move,1,True,3,russia,turkey,6,10,Winter,1901
germany called it an obvious bit of lucy pulling the football away from charlie brown,1,True,3,russia,turkey,6,11,Winter,1901
what are you thinking in regards to the balkans this turn ive got a possible idea but i need to kick the tactics around in my head for a minute before i explain it,1,True,3,russia,turkey,6,12,Spring,1902
i think this set of moves is the safe normal play here  russia a budvie a rum s bulser f bla c ankbul a sevukr  turkey a bulser a ankbul  i think there are other options as well like if i supported austria from serbia to trieste allowing you to move into serbia keeping austria at 3 centers and harming italy that kind of move has a much greater risk of blowing up in our faces however   im willing to follow your lead  here you tell me which way to jump,1,True,3,russia,turkey,6,13,Spring,1902
well hello lots of messages to catch up on  so the convoy move had more or less the intended effect üòÄ  i finally am getting responses from austria so trying to stand italy out of ionian in the sitting is an option otherwise its fall back on original plan which is basically the moves you have up above trying to get tricksy with supporting austria forward sounds like a way to end up with hostile units in galicia   if i were going to put forth another option it would probably be for you to rotate rum to gal while i tap greece and serbia  letting budapest choose which move to support,1,True,-3,turkey,russia,6,14,Spring,1902
well not perfect but we can work with this serbia will take your proxy order this turn  i assume supporting rum to bud,0,,-3,turkey,russia,6,15,Spring,1902
alternative proposal use rum to support serbia and punch your fleet through constantinople to get it on the front line,1,True,-3,turkey,russia,6,16,Fall,1902

side note for a bunch of diplomacy players this board isnt very talkative,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,6,23,Spring,1903
ill agree with that you and germany are the only ones seemingly willing to communicate with me and germany has been talked into a bad faith deal with england it appears im trying to use englands nmr to drive a wedge in that relationship now,1,True,1,russia,turkey,6,24,Spring,1903
i think the way we played 1901 made germany think that i am a giant threat when in actuality i really do want to work with germany   do you think we can get you in trieste this year,1,True,1,russia,turkey,6,25,Spring,1903
quite possibly youll want me to tap it anyway to help protect vienna,1,,-1,turkey,russia,6,26,Spring,1903
found the negotiation point with germany  he wants trieste is that something youre willing to bargain on and if so what do you want,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,6,27,Fall,1903
to be clear im ordered to trieste myself until i hear otherwise from you,1,,-1,turkey,russia,6,28,Fall,1903

wow autocorrect some of the pressure off of you chaos in the west,1,True,0,turkey,russia,6,30,Spring,1904
thats awesome i can work with that it gives me the ability to make offensive moves in the north again with germany under pressure,1,True,0,russia,turkey,6,31,Spring,1904
greetings russia  how is it over there in the north i feel that an francerussia alliance is basically the best in the game of course this is a bit more of a mid and lategame alliance but there is no reason not to work something out rn what do you think looking forwards to a great game  france,0,True,-1,france,russia,6,0,Spring,1901
absolutely i think with the artificial time constraints in this game a three or four way draw is the most likely outcome and as we share no direct spheres of influence i of course bear you no ill will hope to see you in the end game,1,True,1,russia,france,6,1,Spring,1901
alright looking forwards to it have you heard anything of italy france or germany just trying to gather some intel here ü§™,1,True,-1,france,russia,6,2,Spring,1901
hi again russia i dont know about you but i would be interested in an alliance‚Äîour positions perfectly complement each other right now i know that you and turkey have an alliance‚Äîbut if you look at the last few years its clear that you havent gotten anything out of this in the first year of the game you had 7 units and were looking like you basically had the game but once you made your alliance with turkey you were all bottled up and got no more builds but now your actually in a great place to stab turkey with you fleet in bla and your armies in the balkans i think if we play this right the game could practically be ours,0,True,0,france,russia,6,3,Winter,1903

hey i thought we were going for a 3way draw i clearly wasnt going for the solo and i think your decision to attack me was shortsighted and selfish,0,,5,france,russia,6,10,Fall,1906
hey russia everybody vastly overreacted worrying that i was going to go for the solo since i had 11 centers even though i clearly wasnt going to literally everyone teamed up against me reducing me to 9 and frankly i wouldnt be surprised if the attack continued  meanwhile turkey has gotten 12 centers and is in a great position‚Äîyou territory is exposed and turkey is likely going to break through my defenses as well its more than likely that turkey is going for the solo just saying‚Äîif turkey wins its because all of u guys were selfish and ignored the bigger threat at hand on that note i hope turkey doesnt win and that we can come together to stop themmuch like you did to me btw i am sending this message to everybody i hope we can work together to stop the solo,0,,4,france,russia,6,11,Spring,1907

on a more serious note i have come to the realization that france and russia have no intentions to work with me i also realize that you will shortly have no room to grow i propose an alliance between the two of us we try to take out russia before the end of the game thus leaving only three of us to split the pot russia will have no choice but to disband a unit next phase i expect him to disband  his fleet in the south thus leaving you the perfect opportunity to attack let me know what your thoughts are,1,True,-2,england,turkey,6,4,Fall,1905

hi england so i looked at the map and have reassessed my alliances a few years ago you were missing turns and not making the best moves so naturally my decision was to go with russia instead of you for a 3way win but times have changed you have played very well weakened russia and are in a great position me and turkey are planning on stabbing russia this fall and we willmost likely be guaranteed at least 3 of their centers rendereing them very weak so my suggestion to you is that we switch alliances and try to go for a 3way win between me you and turkey turkey is on board with this,0,True,5,france,england,6,45,Spring,1906
on that note if you want to attack denmarkit is appreciatied,1,True,5,france,england,6,46,Spring,1906
youve already proven yourself to be too unweildy of an ally for me i do plan on working against russia with the ottomans and i will gladly accept a threeway draw but i will not be helping you against germany,1,True,-5,england,france,6,47,Fall,1906
i never said you should help me against germany i offered you a position in a three way draw,1,True,5,france,england,6,48,Fall,1906
i said it would be appreciated,1,True,5,france,england,6,49,Fall,1906
ok,0,True,-5,england,france,6,50,Fall,1906
ok,1,True,-5,england,france,6,51,Fall,1906
hey england everybody vastly overreacted worrying that i was going to go for the solo since i had 11 centers even though i clearly wasnt going to literally everyone teamed up against me reducing me to 9 and frankly i wouldnt be surprised if the attack continued  meanwhile turkey has gotten 12 centers and is in a great position‚Äîrussia is exposed and they are likely going to break through my defenses as well its more than likely that turkey is going for the solo just saying‚Äîif turkey wins its because all of u guys were selfish and ignored the bigger threat at hand on that note i hope turkey doesnt win and that we can come together to stop themmuch like you did to me btw i am sending this message to everybody i hope we can put aside our past and stop bickering over here in the west,0,True,3,france,england,6,52,Spring,1907
i will leave you to fight the ottomans,1,True,-3,england,france,6,53,Fall,1907
hey england can we agree it‚Äôs time to put a hold on turkey as they are 3 away from getting the solo we should collaboratesupport each other as it is clear neither of us will be eliminated sending this message to everyone,0,True,2,france,england,6,54,Spring,1908
yes i completely agree i am moving to hold him off in northern russia and if you need i can send you naval support in the mediterranean,1,True,-2,england,france,6,55,Spring,1908
hey i think we can agree that we need to take whatever measures possilble to stop turkey from getting one more supply center we just need to last one more year and i think with some communication it might be possible do whatever it takes to stop turkey,0,True,1,france,england,6,56,Spring,1909
realistically turkey wont be able to take any supply centers from you so what you need to do is move your fleets adjacent to germanys territorieswhich will be attacked and then support germany in them or take them if they have already been taken,1,True,1,france,england,6,57,Spring,1909
this game is probably over but we need to try,1,True,1,france,england,6,58,Spring,1909
thats the plan defend german territory,1,True,-1,england,france,6,59,Spring,1909
thanks,1,True,1,france,england,6,60,Spring,1909
ok i legitimantly think we can stop turkey from getting one more center,1,True,1,france,england,6,61,Fall,1909
what are you thinking for moves,1,True,1,france,england,6,62,Spring,1910
defend mun i guess as long as he doesnt take anything this phase the game will end with a five way draw,1,True,-1,england,france,6,63,Fall,1910
yea russia got lucky,0,True,1,france,england,6,64,Fall,1910
hey turkey   hows it looking over there in the east anyways i was wondering in if you have any intel on italy since i havent heard much from them i realize we most likely wont have too much to do with each other in the beginning but im looking forwards to working with you later in the game if were both still around,1,True,0,france,turkey,6,0,Spring,1901
ive reached out to italy and heard absolutely nothing no response yet sorry he doesnt seem the most talkative type   anyway how you doin,1,True,0,turkey,france,6,1,Spring,1901
hey turkey i dont know if you have noticed but russia is huge rn and is about to crush both you and austria and then proceed to run over the rest of the map idk how your relationship with austria or italy is but you guys really need to work together to stop russia,1,True,0,france,turkey,6,2,Spring,1902
why are you working with russia you realize as soon as they have used you they are going to turn on you and crush you,1,True,0,france,turkey,6,3,Spring,1902
does that mean you dont want to talk about a triple entente,1,,0,turkey,france,6,4,Spring,1902
how would you like to spice this pie,1,True,1,turkey,france,6,5,Fall,1903
hi turkey sorry i havent been in touch actually im interested in working with you you seem like a pretty good player and our positions in this game complement each other we could work on taking out italy if your interested,0,True,-1,france,turkey,6,6,Fall,1903
i mean certainly looks like thats what our positions dictate right now and the fact that hes simply silent,1,True,1,turkey,france,6,7,Fall,1903
ok are you still with russia they are kinda in a pickle rn and are going to have trouble growing unless you help them the only people you can really attack are italy and russia,1,True,-1,france,turkey,6,8,Fall,1903
im assuming your going to take ion and then triest with the help of russia,1,True,-1,france,turkey,6,9,Fall,1903
in any case you attacking triest would be great for both of us since i am going for venice with germanies support if you went for triest we would almost definitly get them both unless russia does something wierd,1,True,-1,france,turkey,6,10,Fall,1903
that was the plan looks like it worked out too anyway kill italy fast then my natural path is to the north no reason for us to waste a lot of time and effort deadlocked in the med,1,False,1,turkey,france,6,11,Fall,1903
i agree about the med but if you have sole control over it im sure you understand that i might worry ideally after italy is wiped out then we would both withdraw or disband our fleets,1,True,0,france,turkey,6,12,Winter,1903
that would be nice but even just making sure we dont start an arms race there by putting more and more units in is a good start we can probably both afford to keep two fleets locking it down for the foreseeable future,1,,0,turkey,france,6,13,Winter,1903
as you could probably guess me and germany have an alliance but if im going to be 100 honest here i think that at this point in the game where germany is completely exposed from the backsideruhr its time to shift our alliances i seriously doubt anybody is going to get the win‚Äîbut getting a twoway win might be possible if i can take out germany and you take out russia italy and england are a piece of cake,0,True,0,france,turkey,6,14,Winter,1903
i like the cut of your jib im planning to cut north after builds and to really make that pay off is assuming that after italy your focus is one of your other neighbors and not me and while i would never advise you to betray a trust youre certainly correct that germany is hella out of position until he can put a couple builds down,1,True,0,turkey,france,6,15,Winter,1903
i dont really think it would make sense to go after you considering i could just walk into germany what are you thinking for builds,1,True,0,france,turkey,6,16,Winter,1903
no plans for my unit in venice rn would you like me to support u into tyr,1,True,0,france,turkey,6,17,Spring,1904
or i could move piedmont to tyr  what do you think,1,True,0,france,turkey,6,18,Spring,1904
ffs is our deadline really midnight monday et  hang on checking map i thought we had more time,1,,0,turkey,france,6,19,Spring,1904
i can support piedmont to tyrolia,1,,0,turkey,france,6,20,Spring,1904
ok let‚Äôs do that i‚Äôm also moving to burgundy and tyrolia so not looking good for germany üòà,1,True,0,france,turkey,6,21,Spring,1904
and now for me to do my part  pivoting now,1,True,0,turkey,france,6,22,Spring,1904
oh and i frigging hate it when someone nmrs and it turns out to be better for them than just about any moves they might have put in  this turn i can cover naples you can cover rome and tunis and either he nmrs again and is eliminated or he puts orders in and can cover at most one of them,1,,0,turkey,france,6,23,Fall,1904
why did you move into venice what are we going to do for moves,1,True,3,france,turkey,6,24,Fall,1905
as long as you tap venice its stable,1,True,-3,turkey,france,6,25,Winter,1905
our borders are a bit awkward especially in italy and i would like there to be more trust between us since we need to work to together i think one problem is the lack of communication we are barely talking to each other,1,True,3,france,turkey,6,26,Spring,1906
on that note i think we should abondon russia and either go for the twoway win or a 3way win w england because they will be extremely hard to eliminate,1,True,3,france,turkey,6,27,Spring,1906
england has just as many units as russia but they are going to be very difficult to eliminate while russia will be easy to wipe out i have already talked to england about this and they are on board,0,True,3,france,turkey,6,28,Spring,1906
so this turn dont actually stab russia yet just get in a convenient position to do so assuming russia doesnt expect anything we will be able to get 3 of russias supply centers i hope you agree to this plan and let me know in the next few hours as i am not going to stab russia unless you are on board,0,True,3,france,turkey,6,29,Spring,1906
oh come on turkey you know there isn‚Äôt any way your going to eliminate me before 1910 and i‚Äôm clearly not going for the solo,0,True,3,france,turkey,6,30,Fall,1906
oof ive been traveling all day and just got your messages no theres no point in trying to eliminate you  and yes im pretty sure we could eliminate russia,1,,-3,turkey,france,6,31,Fall,1906
so could you stop attacking me and instead attack russia whose centers are wide open to your taking your attack on me was very selfish as i am clearly not going to be able to get the solo but we might be able to eliminate russia if you attacked them,0,True,3,france,turkey,6,32,Fall,1906
 what do you think i just did,1,True,-3,turkey,france,6,33,Fall,1906
i sent that before adjudication,1,True,3,france,turkey,6,34,Fall,1906

no i was talking about the person with 12 supply centers,1,True,-3,france,turkey,6,38,Fall,1907
oh  yeah theres not enough time in this game to hit a solo  just attacking russia like everyone kept asking me to do  üôÇ,1,True,3,turkey,france,6,39,Fall,1907
ok let‚Äôs go for a 3way win between me u and england this is the most realistic option at this point,0,True,-7,france,turkey,6,40,Winter,1907
works for me  and notice that im actually putting zero pressure on you now üôÇ,1,True,7,turkey,france,6,41,Winter,1907

i havent heard from russia yet,1,True,0,italy,germany,7,3,Spring,1901
oof so you decided to attack austria and now russia and turkey are in a much better position my advice would be to apologize to austria and fight against this juggernaut that could be forming attacking austria is not gonna work well for you,1,False,0,germany,italy,7,4,Fall,1901

im okay with that,0,False,0,italy,germany,7,6,Fall,1902
im okay with that,0,False,0,italy,germany,7,7,Fall,1902
ummm a juggernaut means russia and turkey hold their alliance above an alliance with austria or italy russia confirmed in chat with me that he has been planning to work with turkey since the beginning,1,False,0,germany,italy,7,8,Fall,1902
hmm i thought it was something else,0,True,0,italy,germany,7,9,Fall,1902
im thoroughly confused as to what is happening in the east russia seems to have lied to everyone,1,,0,germany,italy,7,10,Spring,1903
he asks me to stab every turn hes allied with everyone begging them to stab then everyone is like watch out for the jugg or watch out for the austronaut,1,True,0,italy,germany,7,11,Spring,1903
austria would do a key or speed lepanto and wanted to do blue water which was very pro russian its on him for trusting russia over me,1,True,0,italy,germany,7,12,Spring,1903

hey italy i don‚Äôt want to fight you right now are you familiar with the deep water  deep blue lepanto it‚Äôs a move that lets us work together in the first few years against turkey,1,,0,austria,italy,7,1,Spring,1901
you read my mind,1,,0,austria,italy,7,2,Spring,1901
not key though,1,True,0,austria,italy,7,3,Spring,1901
just to be clear i‚Äôm open to a modified lepanto but not a key i‚Äôve never played with you before and i‚Äôd like to go on a date maybe a nice dinner on a romantic boat ride before giving you a key to my place üòâ,1,True,0,austria,italy,7,4,Spring,1901
i like the key where i go boh and take aeg we both get one build and turkey falls fast,1,,0,italy,austria,7,5,Spring,1901
what does boh stand for here i normally associate that with bohemia the opening i‚Äôm talking about is italy a rom  ven f nap  tyrs a ven  apu f trie  adrs a vie  trie a bud  ,1,True,0,austria,italy,7,6,Spring,1901
from there i take the ionian and you build f nap in spring you kick me out of ion and i retreat east to emed or aeg and then we start convoying in the fall i‚Äôve always thought of key lepanto being where i let you move in to trie and then you move out into serb before winter,1,,0,austria,italy,7,7,Spring,1901
crap i meant bud,1,,0,italy,austria,7,8,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm open to working with you most of my shared wins are either as italy working with austria or vice versa letting you take a home center is a bit more than i‚Äôm willing to give up at this time,1,True,0,austria,italy,7,9,Spring,1901
its cool it takes a ton of trust so i get it that youre unwilling to try unfortunately without a guaranteed center going aeg isnt viable ill think about the blue water,1,True,0,italy,austria,7,10,Spring,1901
at the very least do you want to organize a bounce in ven russia is being aggressive and turkey is stonewalling so we might be looking at an illadvised and obvious juggernaut it‚Äôs possible that‚Äôs just smoke but i‚Äôm always cautious about that and a western triple,1,False,0,austria,italy,7,11,Spring,1901
well if youre worried about a jugg then a blue water seems risky for you sounds like youre hedging,1,True,0,italy,austria,7,12,Spring,1901
it is a risk and a blue water can be bad in that situation i‚Äôm willing to take the risk though because just turtling will lead to a boring game where i‚Äôm eliminated in 1904 i‚Äôd rather have some say over my destiny,1,False,0,austria,italy,7,13,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm going to sleep i‚Äôll respond in the morning,1,True,0,austria,italy,7,14,Spring,1901

i can bounce you in trie if you prefer,1,True,0,austria,italy,7,18,Spring,1901
that doesnt sound like blue water,1,True,0,italy,austria,7,19,Spring,1901
bouncing in trie can be incorporated into a blue water lepanto diplo pouch and diplomacy archive both suggest austria move a vie  trie and f trie  alb they differ on a ven though one says it should check france by moving to pie and the other suggests a ven hold i want to really sell our ‚Äúconflict‚Äù to the other parties and keep a presence up north in case russia tries to force the carpathians a vie  trie bouncing with a ven  trie accomplishes both of these goals for me additionally if i move f trie  adr instead of f trie  alb and we bounce then you don‚Äôt have to worry about me having two units on venice‚Äôs border,1,True,0,austria,italy,7,20,Spring,1901
the question in my mind is how i get into ions,1,True,0,austria,italy,7,21,Spring,1901
bounce in tri you can so adr but its a tough sell alb is much easier to sell then alb  ion,1,True,0,italy,austria,7,22,Spring,1901
do you mean a tough sell to you or the rest of the board,1,True,0,austria,italy,7,23,Spring,1901
just an fyi my moves are currently set for a trie bounce and a move to alb,1,True,0,austria,italy,7,24,Spring,1901
if we are going to move east together then my opinion is that we want a stalemate in the west until we have established control in the east france has confirmed that it will force burgundy this year instead of f nap  ion can you order f nap  tyrs or f ven  pie to scare him off what do you think you can still blue water lepanto with an opening to tyrs and you can take a shot at mar if you move pie i think  france and england decisively destroying germany would be bad for us and would love to hear your thoughts,1,False,0,austria,italy,7,25,Spring,1901
you didnt really secure yourself for blue water you still moving ion or just taking gre,1,True,0,italy,austria,7,26,Fall,1901
i can cover bud i wanted that bounce in trie because i suspected russia was lying turns out russia did directly lie to me this makes me think russia is working with turkey,1,True,0,austria,italy,7,27,Fall,1901
blue water can still happen if you move f ion  tun i‚Äôm putting a lot of trust in you if you stab me i‚Äôm going to let turkey have everything,1,True,0,austria,italy,7,28,Fall,1901

you did have something to lose by ordering that russia getting larger is not good for either of us,1,True,1,germany,austria,7,21,Spring,1903

hello so it sounds like you are already planning on taking sweden and norway i will confess that a strong northern power makes me uncomfortable if you are planning on taking norway you are probably committing your army in moscow to st pete this year then that makes you awfully vulnerable in the south,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,2,Spring,1901
i thought we might work together  if i took norway with your help we could dmz scandinavia  which would allow me to focus on the south,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,3,Spring,1901
anyway thats getting way ahead of ourselves  i cant fight on two fronts id rather work with you in the north and focus on the south,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,4,Spring,1901
id consider that if you didnt build at all in st pete let me talk to france and get back to you since i would clearly benefit more from this in an ef alliance than an eg alliance and france has yet to say anything,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,5,Spring,1901
im comfortable with no build in the north,1,False,1,russia,germany,7,6,Spring,1901
honestly i think that im going to have to dedicate most of my units towards the south  let me know if the proxy fleet concept works for you  id prefer to free up your units to do something more productive than to fight over a build in scandinavia,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,7,Spring,1901
i just dont know how useful that promise is to me unless a i can trust you fully b im all in on an english attack im not saying i dont want to be friends with you im just letting you know that the deal seems a bit flat,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,8,Spring,1901
so  you just autobounce the russian in sweden unless you sealion,1,,1,russia,germany,7,9,Spring,1901
look your tone has me very concerned  you dont seem particularly interested in working with me or exploring the possibilities of us having peace between our units in scandinavia  ive been offering you partnership and opportunity from the getgo and not really feeling like theres any reciprocity  have you already made up your mind how you want to play your position and im wasting my time  or are you open to negotiation and finding common ground and working out a way we can cooperate,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,10,Spring,1901
well you offered to support england against me so im not in a very trusting mood with you ive also heard stuff from austria about you that is concerning so its not just england pulling a fast one on me ive said im not opposed to working with you  and im certainly not opposed to keeping peace between the three of us in scandinavia i just cant commit in spring 01 to fight against england when france has sent very little press and alarming press at that and the things i am hearing about you are conflicting your impatience troubles me even more do you always nail down all of your alliances within hours of the game start,1,,-1,germany,russia,7,11,Spring,1901
no but i like to feel other players out to see what theyre open to and considering  i told england that id be open to moving on you germany which is true  i mean if he had said yes lets do it  you can have norway lets lure him into bouncing you in sweden but in reality ill move there while you move to baltic and make him guess which home center to cover after you move to silesia from warsaw in 01   i mean yeah id probably work with him,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,12,Spring,1901
but just because i said that id be open to it doesnt mean i was trying to get him to attack you from the jump  i also told him what ive told you which is that i think i need to head south and id just like some sort of peaceful arrangement in the north,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,13,Spring,1901
so you just admitted that you are still open to working against me rather than with me so why are you mad at me for telling you from the start that i too am keeping my options open just be patient let me talk to france,1,,-1,germany,russia,7,14,Spring,1901
if youre getting other press from these guys that say that im talking about opening against germany from the jump and you believe it then i think weve got some stiff competition for the 10 bounty for best liar  my preferred option with germany is to leave gal a dmz hold with a moscow and then use it against whoever lies to me in 01 covering warsaw from an austrian or german in galsil going to norway in england lies to me or covering sev if turkey opens to armenia  maybe you find me too direct but i thought we were having a conversation and then you got weird,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,15,Spring,1901
with russia,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,16,Spring,1901
im not mad at you i was just reading the tone of your press  üôÇ  and i read it correctly you were worried about me trying to play you based on what you were getting from england and austria  i also like to keep my options open and to feel out the other players  i dont expect other players to turn around and share my press with my opponents because that strikes me as a poor way to demonstrate ones ability to keep quiet about things  but thank you for letting me know that england cant be trusted  thats valuable information  for what its worth italy is someone you probably shouldnt trust to keep your communications with him quiet either,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,17,Spring,1901
well im glad that we were able to lay that out in the open and i didnt think you were going to pounce on me from the start i just see you as an ambitious player and like i said  having a strong russian presence in the north from an ambitious player combined with a hostile england does not bode well for germany unless germany has already bolstered themselves in my past experience,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,18,Spring,1901
excellent  i respect honesty and competent play  if you can demonstrate both youll have my respect  and also a trustworthy partner,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,19,Spring,1901
well i am very happy to see you move southerly my biggest concern now is france and his movement to burgundy do you have any insight on his plans,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,20,Fall,1901
he forced it very interesting he was not very talkative with me probably because he was focused on chatting with you and england,1,False,1,russia,germany,7,21,Fall,1901
i mean it‚Äôs not a super unusual opening a tad aggressive for my taste but unusual i‚Äôd say there‚Äôs a decent chance he goes to bel and it‚Äôs up to you to figure out what england does yorhol can be killer,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,22,Fall,1901
not but not unusual,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,23,Fall,1901
if england is going to do that it‚Äôs either a new plan or one he wasn‚Äôt comfortable discussing with me he seemed more interested in russia opening south than seeking my assistance against you that could be good for you or it could mean he doesn‚Äôt want me around to be able to help you out,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,24,Fall,1901
you havent talked to france at all can you talk to him now,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,25,Fall,1901
can do would you mind letting me into sweden,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,26,Fall,1901
if i let you into sweden you wont build north and you wont attack me,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,27,Fall,1901
my offer of fleet sweden as your proxy still stands and no i won‚Äôt attack you i might build a stp but definitely not f stpsc,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,28,Fall,1901
okay ill allow you in but if you build army st pete then i dont want that unit moving without me knowing where it is going each phase,0,True,-1,germany,russia,7,29,Fall,1901
ok sounds a little paranoid but fair neither france or england are being forthcoming,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,30,Fall,1901
england tricked me now i must kill them im building a fleet to use against england i will support you in the spring if you promise to use that to contest norway i apologize for bouncing you i did it to secure a relationship with england but he threw that away,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,31,Winter,1901
fleet kiel correct,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,32,Winter,1901
i looked at the map and see that you only have berlin open thank you for the heads up,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,33,Winter,1901
yes i can only do berlin,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,34,Winter,1901
so what‚Äôs the plan do you think you‚Äôve got a friend in france,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,35,Winter,1901
to give you my perspective when i play germany i don‚Äôt bounce sweden in ‚Äò01 as a general rule i wait and see if england is working with me  if he is taking out the solo fleet is too easy and slows down english gains if he isn‚Äôt then now i have a potential ally in place to help  and if england and russia are going to team up on me i‚Äôm screwed anyway  but at least i haven‚Äôt provided russia with additional motivation   now warsil changes that math,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,36,Winter,1901
well i see the merit in most of this i think you are discounting a build in st pete by russia russia can easily get a second unit north and then it isnt just a lone fleet in sweden i still dont trust france completely but at this point i have no other choice than to work with you and france england openly attacked me and neither you nor france have,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,37,Winter,1901
okay am i supporting you into sweden if you are covering st pete id like to go sweden to ensure england doesnt get it just let me know what to do,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,38,Spring,1902
i‚Äôm going to sweden,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,39,Spring,1902
awesome im supporting you,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,40,Spring,1902
thank you,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,41,Spring,1902
thank you for your assistance  it would appear that england is coming for you full bore  is france on your side,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,42,Fall,1902
oh thank goodness it appears france is on my side idk why england has it out for me but its annoying i may need you to either go to norway or support hold denmark if you can,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,43,Fall,1902
norway is intriguing  i wish i was in stp right now  üò¶,0,,1,russia,germany,7,44,Fall,1902
well at least you have the juggernaut going for you now üòâ,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,45,Fall,1902
this guy  lets try to hide it by me pretending to attack you  üëå üò©,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,46,Fall,1902
no one believes its not a juggernaut until russia is in bulgaria or turkey is in rumania,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,47,Fall,1902
austria has asked me to move my units towards you away from him i suppose  how did your discussions with italy go regarding his unit in tyrolia  he seems to have fled south quickly most likely to convoy over to syria,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,48,Fall,1902
actually i didnt even talk to him last phase and the phase before i just said that attacking austria was dumb unless he was in a wintergreen alliance,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,49,Fall,1902
well that was apparently the way to get him to go south,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,50,Fall,1902
even with my help you could still lose denmark,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,51,Fall,1902
he has three fleets to attack with if denmark holds and kiel and sweden support hold he cant take it,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,52,Fall,1902
oh yeah math,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,53,Fall,1902
for what it‚Äôs worth france hasn‚Äôt asked me to move west or anything so he‚Äôs probably your friend,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,54,Fall,1902
thats good to know thanks,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,55,Fall,1902
england just sent me a message that says he is going to take denmark and then stop attacking me because of france  like what is he doing,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,56,Fall,1902
i had an opportunity to dmz the north sorry though now that england left north sea as a retreat location i might not find norway such easy pickings ,1,,1,russia,germany,7,57,Fall,1902
hi  did you want to talk at all,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,58,Fall,1902
i mean,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,59,Fall,1902
is there any way of me getting your help this phase,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,60,Fall,1902
im not actually in any of your centers,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,61,Fall,1902
but you supported england into my sc after i supported you,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,62,Fall,1902
what do you want  would you prefer to focus on england,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,63,Fall,1902
i thought i made myself clear that england was my whole focus last phase now that youve allied with england against me i have two people to be mad at now you attacking me is more understandable than england though,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,64,Fall,1902
oh except you are in bohemia and silesia,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,65,Fall,1902
well he agreed to dmz the north as i explained and then he made the moves to support it,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,66,Fall,1902
i am,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,67,Fall,1902
look it doesnt do me great good to knock you out of the game right away  i was wondering if youd be open to a dialogue or are you closed off to any kind of dicussions,1,True,1,russia,germany,7,68,Fall,1902
i mean im open to discussion but im using most of my efforts with other countries since i feel like i wont be able to get very far this phase with you in later phases things will change though,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,69,Fall,1902
my only real bargaining chip is helping you against england in scandinavia or supporting you against austria,1,True,-1,germany,russia,7,70,Fall,1902
how would you suggest going about helping me against austria,1,True,3,russia,germany,7,71,Spring,1903
well tbh i am mostly going to be holding this phase im going to munich though and if you relieve pressure on me i can continue south and support you there,0,True,-3,germany,russia,7,72,Spring,1903
i wouldnt mind you disbanding one of your 5 northern troops tbh i dont know why you only have 2 troops protecting your south when austria and turkey can both attack you strongly now,1,True,-2,germany,russia,7,73,Winter,1903
thought england was interested in working with me against you  i have no idea why he went for sweden instead of taking a guaranteed support into kiel  sorry,1,True,2,russia,germany,7,74,Winter,1903
youre apologizing to me for england not attacking me,1,True,-2,germany,russia,7,75,Winter,1903
sure,1,True,2,russia,germany,7,76,Winter,1903
i‚Äôm apologizing for trusting him,1,True,2,russia,germany,7,77,Winter,1903
would you like support into denmark,1,True,2,russia,germany,7,78,Spring,1904
if i order kiel to denmark you could take berlin by force once youve backed off my border ill consider moving my troops in a way other than protecting myself against invaders,1,True,-2,germany,russia,7,79,Spring,1904
that‚Äôs totally fair i‚Äôll make that a possibility,1,False,2,russia,germany,7,80,Spring,1904
what do you want me to build,1,True,-3,russia,germany,7,81,Winter,1906
an army would be preferable,1,True,3,germany,russia,7,82,Winter,1906
done  can we go our separate ways,1,True,-3,russia,germany,7,83,Winter,1906
yeah im trying to figure out what austria and italy are doing now,1,True,3,germany,russia,7,84,Winter,1906
well italy is about to get desparate for dots  so id watch your back,1,True,-3,russia,germany,7,85,Winter,1906
i build the army and would like to head south  id appreciate it if you held off from attacking stp or headed towards warsaw  i honestly believe that you have bigger fish to fry and can makes some great headway with your fleets if you head west,1,True,-3,russia,germany,7,86,Spring,1907
why are you sending your fleet at me,1,True,-3,russia,germany,7,87,Fall,1907
please if i wanted to attack you id go from norway baltic was going to cover berlin but now it will bounce in denmark,1,True,3,germany,russia,7,88,Fall,1907
classical midgame mistake going after russia instead of austria,1,True,-4,russia,germany,7,89,Winter,1907
the problem with weakening russia at this point  is by the time you shift towards austria theres no  way to beat him off  and you cant hold warsaw and moscow against him,1,True,-4,russia,germany,7,90,Winter,1907
he only has 4 scs,1,True,4,germany,russia,7,91,Winter,1907
well who do you think will get italy‚Äôs,1,True,-4,russia,germany,7,92,Winter,1907
france,1,True,4,germany,russia,7,93,Winter,1907
eye roll,1,,-4,russia,germany,7,94,Winter,1907
those two have been cuddle buddies from the jump,1,,-4,russia,germany,7,95,Winter,1907
hello germany i figured we should open up talks,1,True,0,england,germany,7,0,Spring,1901
yes most certainly i would very much like to work with you against russia to keep him from dominating the north and working against france together would also be great eg is one of my favorite alliances to play,1,True,0,germany,england,7,1,Spring,1901
would you be okay with the idea of me having hol the fifth build can be tough for england,1,True,0,england,germany,7,2,Spring,1901
i would very much not be okay with you having hol its an sc directly bordering my home i can help you into bel though or help you against russia into sweden or st pete for that extra sc or 2,1,True,0,germany,england,7,3,Spring,1901
understandable but worth the ask in my opinion not trying to be overly aggressive,1,True,0,england,germany,7,4,Spring,1901
i don‚Äôt want to overcommit to attacking anyone this early but i appreciate you offering support so you don‚Äôt think you and france will be friendly,0,True,0,england,germany,7,5,Spring,1901
as a western power i usually stay undecided as to who i really want to work with during the first year but generally speaking i prefer an eg over an fg or ef it just makes dealing with russia so much easier,1,True,0,germany,england,7,6,Spring,1901
makes sense i play germany the same way any time that i am too aggressive or get 6 in the first year i end up getting ganged up on,1,True,0,england,germany,7,7,Spring,1901
so russia sent me a message asking for a deal he said if i would help him into sweden he would support me into north sea after he takes norway this obviously raises some red flags since he is already assuming he will take norway id be surprised if he wasnt opening moscow to st pete,1,True,0,germany,england,7,8,Spring,1901
he told me he wants to open against germany and that he would help me into denmark from sweden üòÇ i didn‚Äôt believe him and voted so because that is a terrible opening for russia seems like he is a troublemaker,1,True,0,england,germany,7,9,Spring,1901
lol yeah hes the only person ive thumbs downed so far,1,True,0,germany,england,7,10,Spring,1901
so he told austria to his face that he plans on moving into gal according to austria seems like a wildcard,1,True,0,england,germany,7,11,Spring,1901
have you actually talked to france yet,1,True,0,england,germany,7,12,Spring,1901
i sent a message he just responded reading it next,1,True,0,germany,england,7,13,Spring,1901
how‚Äôd that go,1,True,0,england,germany,7,14,Spring,1901
well he told me he was supporting himself into burgundy so uhhhh not really liking him so far,1,True,0,germany,england,7,15,Spring,1901
oof yeah that is aggressive at least he‚Äôs honest,1,True,0,england,germany,7,16,Spring,1901
he could be bluffing get me to think that moving to bur is pointless and that i should stay in munich instead he blitzes north to pic and takes bur from marseilles uncontested now he has two units poised to take bel or possibly attack munich if i do leave either way telling me that is not good news for me,1,True,0,germany,england,7,17,Spring,1901
yeah it means he will not be friendly i‚Äôll be in nth so i‚Äôll be in a powerful position i‚Äôll be happy to lend support assuming i am cleared to get nwy just let me know,0,True,0,england,germany,7,18,Spring,1901
yeah i think well be fine its just hard that france and russia are both playing against us,1,True,0,germany,england,7,19,Spring,1901
we will see what russia actually does they seem like a wildcard,1,True,0,england,germany,7,20,Spring,1901
well you are poised to take norway and i can bounce russia out of sweden id like to take holland but you can have belgium unfortunately france did get into burgundy like he said so he could either go to munich or belgium,1,True,0,germany,england,7,21,Fall,1901
yeah i am trying to find out for you discretely if he will be hitting munich are you actually planning on bouncing swe i think it‚Äôs a fun move how do you want to handle the french threat i might be able to bounce him  in bel or even take it if he goes mun like i would expect,0,True,0,england,germany,7,22,Fall,1901
in full disclosure france offered to go to ec and i said id love that fully expecting him to never go there why would he give up a build to go ec france told me that you were lobbying for him to go to ruhr which doesnt exactly match up with the last message you just sent me,1,True,0,germany,england,7,23,Fall,1901
if france doesnt go to bel spain and portugal i would be very surprised im going to cover munich regardless its too big of a risk to let him in,1,True,0,germany,england,7,24,Fall,1901
that makes sense that‚Äôs annoying that france is trying to split us up at least i can bounce him in bel are you doing the russia bounce if i am going to stand with you i need to know if i have to prepare for some russian anger,1,True,0,england,germany,7,25,Fall,1901
yeah i lied to russia,1,True,0,germany,england,7,26,Fall,1901
üòÇüòÇ sounds good so how do you want me to play this turn hit bel,1,,0,england,germany,7,27,Fall,1901
you never denied that you told france to go to ruhr,1,True,0,germany,england,7,28,Fall,1901
im too paranoid for this game,1,True,0,germany,england,7,29,Fall,1901
i would love it if you went to bel,1,True,0,germany,england,7,30,Fall,1901
i did not tell france to go ruh i don‚Äôt want that much pressure on you and it would be better for us if he went bel and i bounced him,0,True,0,england,germany,7,31,Fall,1901
well that was kinda dumb on your part you knew i was going to holland so you didnt get a build and you made me mad i was soooooo sold on allying with you all game but not anymore can you please explain your thought process there,1,True,0,germany,england,7,32,Winter,1901
not sure what i need to explain i feel like i have more to gain siding with france especially since you have angered russia,1,True,0,england,germany,7,33,Spring,1902
except that france is now at 6 scs and you are at 4 and im much more angry at you france is in a much better position than you now,1,True,0,germany,england,7,34,Spring,1902
i still dont understand why you are gunning for me i literally was ready to work with you wholeheartedly and you are attacking me while leaving yourself open to russia and france who are not exactly helping you back i guess their lies are more persuasive than my truth,1,True,0,germany,england,7,35,Fall,1902
i stabbed you but now it looks like france is stabbing me i‚Äôm going to stop attacking you after i take den,1,True,0,england,germany,7,36,Fall,1902
lol or you could not take denmark protect yourself and try to stop france,1,True,0,germany,england,7,37,Fall,1902
so if you stop attacking me i will shift all aggression to russia,1,,-1,germany,england,7,38,Spring,1903
if you want to help stop russia from rolling me then possibly teaming up with france against you i would appreciate denmark tapping baltic,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,39,Fall,1903
i‚Äôd consider it if you could get france off my back,1,True,1,england,germany,7,40,Fall,1903
i tried working with you against france at the beginning and you declined now its a bit late as i warned you before i can try to get him to back off but it will be very difficult at this point,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,41,Fall,1903
yeah i‚Äôm not saying that we have a full alliance but there‚Äôs no reason for me to just help you especially when it would leave me with 0 allies,1,True,1,england,germany,7,42,Fall,1903
do you have more than 0 allies right now i wouldnt consider russia an ally so much as he isnt going to attack you until im dead russia has turned on turkey when convenient turned on austria when convenient and italy thought they were allies when they werent trusting russia will kill you,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,43,Fall,1903
okay so several countries have come to me saying that you are painting me as not wanting to work with you thats entirely false i have made 0 moves against you you have attacked me i have asked for your help against russia you said you would only do it if i somehow got france to help from my point of view i have done everything in my power to work with you and you are spurning me at any chance you get please stop working against me please stop spreading false ideas about me is there something i did to personally offend you,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,44,Fall,1903
i am not trying to spread lies i genuinely feel as though you have no interest in working with me i was under the impression that you said that it was ‚Äútoo late‚Äù for us to work together englandgermanyfrance is always a 2 on 1 usually with england choosing their side i played both and decided to go with france mainly because their plan and communication felt better i chose wrong and i am paying dearly for it i apologize for doing so at this point it feels as though you are working with france which is inherently against me if i have read that wrong then i apologize but for those reasons i could not just go against russia because in doing so i would cause a 3 on 1 that is why i asked you to get france off of me in exchange it is the only way i survive otherwise it doesn‚Äôt make a difference to me if i lose and france wins or i lose and russia wins,1,True,1,england,germany,7,45,Fall,1903
i am honestly sorry for how our game has started and i am proposing an alliance between the two of us i know that it will be hard for you to trust me but i think that you can see that it is my only option and so to betray you again would be short sighted and suicidal if you can‚Äôt trust me then i have no choice but to hope russia wants me as his sidekick given my navel power i don‚Äôt want that to be my role in this game so i hope that you will consider my proposal,1,True,1,england,germany,7,46,Fall,1903
thank you for being honest with me now im not working against you at all i am very interested in working with you considering that i was the one who approached you and asked to work against russia together  i actually felt like you didnt want to work with me because you were saying you wouldnt work with me unless france backed off  something i cant control,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,47,Fall,1903
i have been talking with france and i think i might have actually got him properly scared of russia to back off of you im waiting to hear back from my latest message but he will only do it if you actually do help against russia something i still dont know if i can trust you on,0,True,-1,germany,england,7,48,Fall,1903
so how do we do this i can help you by stopping russia in the north you can help me by putting some pressure on france so that he has to go home what do you think about me supporting you into the bal from kiel and supporting you into bel you push back russia a little and cost france a build if you cut the bur support,1,True,1,england,germany,7,49,Fall,1903
oh so you don‚Äôt want to go against france,1,True,1,england,germany,7,50,Fall,1903
i cant attack france with munich this turn i will likely lose munich if i attack bur and then that does me no good at all since ill be at like 1 sc at the end of the year,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,51,Fall,1903
that‚Äôs fair how about that kiel move then,1,True,1,england,germany,7,52,Fall,1903
if russia moves baltic into berlin with support than i have lost berlin vacated kiel and again im down to like 2 scs i really do want to work with you but you and russia put me in a super super bad position and i pretty much have to hold this phase i have tried to think of ways around it and i just cant,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,53,Fall,1903
holland is free though,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,54,Fall,1903
i suppose if i trusted you and france 100 i could use holland to cover for kiel,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,55,Fall,1903
i am sending nth to lon this year i hope it works which would make you feel better if you want this to work you will have to trust me,1,True,1,england,germany,7,56,Fall,1903
honestly i think the best help might just be tapping baltic for me so that i can hold everything tight this phase but thats just going to stall everything out so idk this game is pretty hopeless for me im afraid,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,57,Fall,1903
me as well i messed up things for both of us and i apologize why don‚Äôt i just gamble and take sweden,1,True,1,england,germany,7,58,Fall,1903
well bot is probably going to sweden so that also wouldnt be a terrible move,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,59,Fall,1903
bot might fill bal he thinks i‚Äôm getting him into ber this turn,1,True,1,england,germany,7,60,Fall,1903
where are you supposed to be supporting him from,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,61,Fall,1903
oh bal,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,62,Fall,1903
yep obviously i will not though,1,True,1,england,germany,7,63,Fall,1903
okay yeah this is good i think going to sweden will work best then,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,64,Fall,1903
just waiting to hear back from france now,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,65,Fall,1903
same,1,True,1,england,germany,7,66,Fall,1903
well russia has a disband and we both kept our scs this year so thats good news france unfortunately still seems intent on attacking you he never responded to my last message,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,67,Winter,1903
russia offered me support into denmark no doubt still trying to take berlin or maybe trying to get norway,1,True,-1,germany,england,7,68,Spring,1904
yeah this france thing is getting annoying,1,True,1,england,germany,7,69,Spring,1904
hello russia sounds like he is opening moscow into st pete just thought id let you know to help you plan,1,False,0,germany,turkey,7,0,Spring,1901
hello there you seem to be certain about that i wont be making my plans on something like that you will understand that i could easily get locked in a deadly war that way,1,True,0,turkey,germany,7,1,Spring,1901
ill be honest and say im not enthused about seeing austria get attacked from italy and russia although i am pleasantly surprised seeing russia open more southerly im not sure what your plans are but we would both hate to see a wintergreen alliance which looks very possible right now,1,True,0,germany,turkey,7,2,Fall,1901
i am not sure what is happening but you did send wrong info on russia your agenda looks like making me fight russia i could if you are willing to commit,1,True,0,turkey,germany,7,3,Fall,1901
russia promised me he would help support me into north sea from norway implying he would move north that obviously didnt happen,1,True,0,germany,turkey,7,4,Fall,1901
that also implies you dont help england or that you help him to het in norway in the first place we definitely should stay in contact and work our way to brighter future,1,True,0,turkey,germany,7,5,Fall,1901
tought times for you and me,1,True,0,turkey,germany,7,6,Fall,1902
would you be interested in cooperation with me and maybe italy,1,True,0,turkey,germany,7,7,Fall,1902
yes but how,1,,0,germany,turkey,7,8,Fall,1902
let england and france fight each other maybe even side with france to secure land border ill try to talk to italy could you do it also austria is a mere vassal so maybe a word but not too much italian army could be very useful if he decides to work with us after a round or two explain england that russia is behind everything and that you could help him if he turns on russia,1,True,0,turkey,germany,7,9,Fall,1902
rough idea but neither i or you have better option if we do have please say so,1,True,0,turkey,germany,7,10,Fall,1902
so did turkey stab you,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,7,11,Spring,1903
i am turkey lol,0,True,1,turkey,germany,7,12,Spring,1903
lol,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,7,13,Spring,1903
i meant to ask is russia stabbed you,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,7,14,Spring,1903
if,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,7,15,Spring,1903
i would say so now,1,True,1,turkey,germany,7,16,Fall,1903
do you think you can persuade england to help,1,True,1,turkey,germany,7,17,Fall,1903
ive been trying to persuade him all game and have done nothing to him but he still attacks me even when france and russia are gonna clobber him,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,7,18,Fall,1903
england says you are refusing a truce with him,1,True,1,turkey,germany,7,19,Fall,1903
thats false i asked england for help and he said the only way he would help me is if i stopped france from attacking him i said id try but that that would be very difficult i reached out to england and he is asking for unreasonable things in return i have no control over france,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,7,20,Fall,1903
hello there my dear kaiser nice to meet you üòÑ,1,True,0,france,germany,7,0,Spring,1901
hello hello what are your thoughts on an fg alliance,1,True,0,germany,france,7,1,Spring,1901
hello hello i for one would not oppose one what are your thoughts,1,True,0,france,germany,7,2,Spring,1901
well russia has seemed to be stirring up all kinds of trouble but he has offered me help against england so thats a point in favor of an fg i would like to at least dmz bur in 01,1,True,0,germany,france,7,3,Spring,1901
that‚Äôs funny austria just asked for me to bounce you there so mun can protect against a potential tyr invasion,1,True,0,france,germany,7,4,Spring,1901
idk why austria thinks tyr is going to be invaded this year,1,True,0,germany,france,7,5,Spring,1901
guess he‚Äôs just nervous like he said,1,True,0,france,germany,7,6,Spring,1901
well if you really want to we can bounce,1,True,0,germany,france,7,7,Spring,1901
the truth is i‚Äôm supporting par into bur so i can make a play at belpic in the fall since you‚Äôll see i‚Äôm telling the truth after spring i‚Äôll also say within the same message that i have no intentions of moving into mun whether italy is there or not there‚Äôs no point pissing you off and taking mun when i can‚Äôt even defend it for more than a year and i value honesty above centers this might be a rough start to our alliance but i don‚Äôt want any fuckery around burgundy so i‚Äôm taking it for myself and i hope we can work together well afterwards,1,True,0,france,germany,7,8,Spring,1901
well that obviously makes it difficult for us to work together this year what is your plan in the fall,1,True,0,germany,france,7,9,Spring,1901
as ive said before typically use it control belgium and make sure that england isnt able to convoy an army onto our lands,0,True,0,france,germany,7,10,Spring,1901
alright so you actually went to burgundy i dont really trust you to stay out of munich so far so ill be covering munich and you can have belgium,1,True,0,germany,france,7,11,Fall,1901
what are your thoughts on a delayed fg attack on england,1,True,0,france,germany,7,12,Fall,1901
im aware i might have pissed you off a little and id like to change the course of that i could still move eng and bel this season and wed have the jump,1,True,0,france,germany,7,13,Fall,1901
moving to ec would certainly tip me towards working with you more i hope you understand that i still cant commit this turn though,1,True,0,germany,france,7,14,Fall,1901
fair enough i still apologize for bur i tried to be as honest and clear as i could and i hope you see that im now dedicated towards a potential alliance between us,1,True,0,france,germany,7,15,Fall,1901
i mean being honest is great but i need to see honesty and moves that are mutually beneficial what you did was honest but not mutually beneficial ec would be mutually beneficial now we will see if you are honest,1,True,0,germany,france,7,16,Fall,1901
as much as i would like to go ec i cant without a full commitment so i guess we can see how fallbuilds play out and go from there but just know that the option is there üôÇ,1,True,0,france,germany,7,17,Fall,1901
you could bounce me if you want in bel if that would make you feel bettersafer as ive said before my main priority is making sure england doesnt get an army onto our lands,1,True,0,france,germany,7,18,Fall,1901
you keep saying you want to work with me but then you say you cant move in a way where we work together how am i supposed to commit to that,1,True,0,germany,france,7,19,Fall,1901
i hope you understand that i still cant commit this turn though,1,True,0,france,germany,7,20,Fall,1901
i dont expect you to commit to anything this season which is fair for both you and me,1,True,0,france,germany,7,21,Fall,1901
also englands told me that hell leak stuff to you im telling you this as a sign of trust hopefully but if you still dont believe me after all this then idk ,1,True,0,france,germany,7,22,Fall,1901
fair although you have made antigerman moves while i have made fairly neutral moves,1,,0,germany,france,7,23,Fall,1901
i made one move that protects burgundy and makes sure that both parmar are safe,1,True,0,france,germany,7,24,Fall,1901
i apologize if it seemed super antigerman and ive said countless times that i dont intend for it to be an antigerman opening,1,True,0,france,germany,7,25,Fall,1901
england really wants me to move ruh take that as you will and believe me if you want,1,True,0,france,germany,7,26,Fall,1901
you dont have to intend to be anti german to make moves that are anti german you being in burgundy and not in ec is certainly anti german there is no arguing that look we could talk in circles here but all im saying is that i need to see some moves that are not antigerman before i work with you,1,True,0,germany,france,7,27,Fall,1901
fair enough lets circle back next season üôÇ,1,True,0,france,germany,7,28,Fall,1901
okay im in england obviously doesnt want to work with me,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,29,Winter,1901
i told you i wasnt going for mun,1,True,2,france,germany,7,30,Winter,1901
yes i know england tricked me which means im trust you more than him now,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,31,Winter,1901
im building a fleet i hope that is enough to gain your trust,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,32,Winter,1901
i appreciate that a lot perhaps we can start our cooperation up north,1,True,2,france,germany,7,33,Spring,1902
glad we‚Äôve come so far since spring 01 üòÑ,1,True,2,france,germany,7,34,Spring,1902
so it sounds like england thinks he is working with you you have a choice to make support me into hol or support england in what are you going to do,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,35,Spring,1902
i wont contest you going into holland,1,False,2,france,germany,7,36,Spring,1902
i guess you could support neither that would be an interesting move,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,37,Spring,1902
haha,1,True,2,france,germany,7,38,Spring,1902
that would certainly be interesting,1,True,2,france,germany,7,39,Spring,1902
if i support you into hol how do you think youll move your fleets,1,True,2,france,germany,7,40,Spring,1902
well im waiting to hear back from russia but id like to work with russia to get england out of scandinavia denmark will likely stay berlin is going to kiel if i get support from there i go to heligoland bight and put pressure on north sea hopefully with russia and your help,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,41,Spring,1902
if i dont get your support or russias cooperation im basically stuck,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,42,Spring,1902
if you do those moves then i suppose im in,1,False,2,france,germany,7,43,Spring,1902
let me know if russia gets back to you,1,True,2,france,germany,7,44,Spring,1902
will do,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,45,Spring,1902
thank you,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,46,Fall,1902
england is really gunning for me not sure why he opened himself up to you and russia so much just to come after me,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,47,Fall,1902
okay so im gonna have to support denmark and holland against england this turn probably unless you think i could use my troops more wisely,0,True,-2,germany,france,7,48,Fall,1902
oh boy i didnt even see the juggernaut until just now,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,49,Fall,1902
lol england just said hes going to denmark and then stop attacking me,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,50,Fall,1902
ahh apologies havent been able to check for a while,0,True,2,france,germany,7,51,Fall,1902
yes the jugg is quite scary and austria seems quite inept unfortunately,1,True,2,france,germany,7,52,Fall,1902
haha i hope you flagged the stop attacking me message from england as a lie üòÅ,1,True,2,france,germany,7,53,Fall,1902
supporting ruhmun and have bel s hol in,1,True,2,france,germany,7,54,Spring,1903
sorry ive been busy im going ruhmun and so i should be good to not lose scs this phase as long as you support me,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,55,Spring,1903
russia is gonna roll this game i think,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,56,Spring,1903
agreed seems like fgia vs jugg and england,1,True,2,france,germany,7,57,Spring,1903
hopefully england will relieve some pressure off you since im attacking him,1,True,2,france,germany,7,58,Spring,1903
well i think russia turned on turkey to fight austria now,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,59,Spring,1903
i mean italy has an army in syr dont see why russia would open another front and fight turkey,1,True,2,france,germany,7,60,Spring,1903
regardless lets just grind this out and hopefully we come out on top üòÇ,1,True,2,france,germany,7,61,Spring,1903
italy thought he was working with russia too from what ive heard üòÇ,1,,-2,germany,france,7,62,Spring,1903
good luck against england lets hope i can out guess russia,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,63,Fall,1903
england said he would help me against russia if you backed off not sure i trust him though,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,64,Fall,1903
i wouldnt either wouldnt hurt to at least lie about it and see what he says,1,True,2,france,germany,7,65,Fall,1903
regardless i hope you trust that im with you in the long run üôÇ,1,True,2,france,germany,7,66,Fall,1903
yeah think you can sell him on the lie,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,67,Fall,1903
me he contacted you but i would probably be able to,1,True,2,france,germany,7,68,Fall,1903
like i told england i would talk to you if i go to him and said you agreed he is less likely to  believe it than if we both talked him through it,1,,-2,germany,france,7,69,Fall,1903
i suppose we should have a reason you are willing to back off of him so its more reasonable,1,,-2,germany,france,7,70,Fall,1903
okay england and i have been talking quite a bit and i think he might come around if you could just talk to him before deadline and stress that he needs to attack russia that might get him to do what we want,1,,-2,germany,france,7,71,Fall,1903
england is moving north sea to london btw,1,,-2,germany,france,7,72,Fall,1903
how ya doin,1,True,1,france,germany,7,73,Spring,1907
good just trying to figure out what austria is doing,1,True,-1,germany,france,7,74,Spring,1907
good progress on the western front now time to swing east üòÅ perhaps you can use bal to get armies into prulvn while i‚Äôll send all my fleets south like i have right now and try to stop this italyaustria alliance,1,True,2,france,germany,7,75,Winter,1907
yup gonna head eastsouth now gotta eliminate russia next,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,76,Winter,1907
some help against austria would also be appreciated,1,True,2,france,germany,7,77,Winter,1907
that fleet you built is slightly concerning id like it to go to mao this phase and id like to bounce north sea just for good measure,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,78,Spring,1908
sounds good to me,1,True,2,france,germany,7,79,Spring,1908
ideally it would be in mar but i need to deal with pie for the time being,1,True,2,france,germany,7,80,Spring,1908
would you be fine bouncing nwg and nth this season,1,True,2,france,germany,7,81,Fall,1908
would be nice if you could somehow slide into boh id be willing to give you venice later after i take romnap,1,True,2,france,germany,7,82,Fall,1908
done and done,1,,-2,germany,france,7,83,Fall,1908
apologies for the move to mao i thought there was a possibility you would force yourself into nth happy to see your progress east though let me know what i can do to help üòÑ,1,True,2,france,germany,7,84,Fall,1909
with a force draw in 1910 theres no reason for either of us to stab otherwise i probably would have move mao back south and continue bouncing please,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,85,Fall,1909
i wont stab i just wanted to protect belnth for 1910 in case you decided to catch up with me to stab me ill support hold my units along our border and would be willing to support you into tri perhaps if i get into ven this spring,1,True,2,france,germany,7,86,Winter,1909
was a fun game though ggs and thanks for being a great ally üòÑ,1,True,2,france,germany,7,87,Winter,1909
yeah working together worked out much better for us than backstabbing worked for any of the others,1,True,-2,germany,france,7,88,Winter,1909
friendship always prevails,1,True,2,france,germany,7,89,Winter,1909
greetings and salutations  i prefer not to bounce in galicia  it weakens austria against italy since you cant cover trieste and it means i have to move moscow to ukraine which commits that unit to a southern direction early  what are you thoughts,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,0,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm not a fan of fighting italy or russia as austria germany will also probably guarantee tyr i just want to survive and you two are capable of picking me apart is there some sort of arrangement we can come to with turkey and the balkans that doesn‚Äôt involve me wasting away in the carpathians,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,1,Spring,1901
how much of turkey are you willing to let the italian have  id like two centers and id be comfortable with you having bulgaria  as long as you were willing to head after italy next,1,,1,russia,austria,7,2,Spring,1901
two centers is a lot to give if i‚Äôm doing the heavy lifting and then fighting italy on top of it unless you‚Äôre going through arm i assumed you‚Äôd be going north,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,3,Spring,1901
i mean im assuming youve got italy doing a lepanto and getting out of position   when you said an arrangement with turkey   did you mean the three of us working together or you and i splitting him up  cause if we split him up then a 5050 split seems pretty fair right  id get two and youd get bulgaria and another,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,4,Spring,1901
i meant carving him up if you take the armenian opening i‚Äôm fine with a 2  1  1,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,5,Spring,1901
i just need some time to figure out gal i can always use gal to support you into rum,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,6,Spring,1901
the armenian opening  what is that  ive never heard of it,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,7,Spring,1901
there‚Äôs a couple ways to do it the most sure fire is f sev  rum a mos  sev a war  ukr f rum  sev a ukr  sev a sev  arm,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,8,Spring,1901
the less sure is hoping you don‚Äôt bounce in black while moving a mos  sev ‚Äî a sev  arm f black  bul ec a ukr  rum,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,9,Spring,1901
i think i would prefer to sit back and see whats happening before committing so strongly to an opening like that,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,10,Spring,1901
i would prefer if we left galicia a dmz im not comfortable with you moving in there in 01  i think keeping it unoccupied during the game would be best for us to have a partnership,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,11,Spring,1901
may i ask what your intentions are with war and mos they have to go somewhere and they both don‚Äôt fit down south if you don‚Äôt move into gal or sev,1,,-1,austria,russia,7,12,Spring,1901
i prefer to hold with moscow and see whos telling me the truth,1,False,1,russia,austria,7,13,Spring,1901
have you been telling people that you‚Äôre opening to galicia i‚Äôve had several players ask me if i‚Äôm bouncing you there,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,14,Spring,1901
no i have not told anyone that i‚Äôm moving to galicia i‚Äôve even told a couple that i wasn‚Äôt going to the only reason that would happen is if you and i don‚Äôt work out an agreement and i have to do a hedgehog,1,False,-1,austria,russia,7,15,Spring,1901
i would like to stress that my preference is for gal to be a dmz with no bounces,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,16,Spring,1901
i need confirmation from you that you‚Äôre staying out of gal i don‚Äôt want to destabilize things by moving there if you‚Äôre not attacking it,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,17,Spring,1901
getting to my phone now  my preference is to dmz galicia as well,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,18,Spring,1901
cool i‚Äôm moving a standard austrian opening that gives me flexibility with greece and italy,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,19,Spring,1901
i changed my orders to galicia because a i felt that you waffled back and forth on it and b corroboration from other players,1,False,1,russia,austria,7,20,Fall,1901
and i‚Äôd rather guess wrong and be there myself than guess wrong and have someone else be there,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,21,Fall,1901
who told you i was moving there i never told anyone that i was moving gal i only ever said that i might hedgehog if you kept me in the dark i‚Äôm asking who gave you the gal info because i want to make sure i don‚Äôt get stabbed again,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,22,Fall,1901
if you want to try and repair the relationship will you move a gal  rum,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,23,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm open to that when i was told you were looking to hedgehog the word ‚Äúmight‚Äù was dropped off then i had to google ‚Äúaustria‚Äù and ‚Äúhedgehog‚Äù and  that‚Äôs a low win probability opening imo,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,24,Fall,1901
yeah it is because it means that austria has no friends and is doomed to die first i hate it and almost prefer to do a key lepanto over a hedgehog,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,25,Fall,1901
i‚Äôve never willingly participated in a key lepanto,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,26,Fall,1901
i‚Äôve done it twice and it worked but those were on an android app where people were more likely to do silly things,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,27,Fall,1901
i have had one or two forced on me and in my past 5 or so games i had to fight one off as turkey,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,28,Fall,1901
france benefited from that one,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,29,Fall,1901
what‚Äôs going on in tyolia was italy supposed to go to venice as well,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,30,Winter,1901
nothing good is going on that was an unnecessary move,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,31,Winter,1901
well unnecessary if you‚Äôre going to parent with him yes i left galicia and that should give us some space to work together if you‚Äôd like to make a suggestion,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,32,Winter,1901
i‚Äôm thinking i‚Äôll have to get back to you italy and france getting 3 builds presents a bit of a pickle,1,False,-1,austria,russia,7,33,Winter,1901
i think an ef is good for you,1,,1,russia,austria,7,34,Winter,1901
hey i‚Äôll be back online around 7 pm est if you‚Äôd like to talk about how we proceed with respect to the balkans,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,35,Spring,1902
would you mind sharing why you picked a war over a mos,1,,-1,austria,russia,7,36,Spring,1902
yes england asked me to build there,1,,1,russia,austria,7,37,Spring,1902
he‚Äôs asked me to go after germany with him,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,38,Spring,1902
turkey of course is asking me to send it to galicia which is why i‚Äôd really like to talk to you about the balkans,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,39,Spring,1902
france is going to eat up most of those gains if you pressure germany from the west and then take england easily france has the largest navy and no real threats that being said your relations with the west are none of my business,1,False,-1,austria,russia,7,40,Spring,1902
what do you think about f sev  arm  a ukr  sev a rum s a ukr  sev a serb s a rum hold,1,False,-1,austria,russia,7,41,Spring,1902
depending on how the spring shapes up i will be able to act more directly against the turks,1,False,-1,austria,russia,7,42,Spring,1902
that seems like a horrible set of orders  why not suggest that i cut bla with sev and either you support me into bulgaria or i support you into bulgaria  it sounds like youre trying to get me out of position and slow turkey down while you work with him,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,43,Spring,1902
i‚Äôm not meaning to push you out of position turkey built f smy and is probably going to hit greece and move his armies up behind him if he does that he‚Äôll have to either rush losing ank or cede control of black i‚Äôm hoping to have a more certain lay of the land after spring and expect to be in a place where i can help take down turkey if i attack turkey now i‚Äôll lose what little advantage i have over turkey i‚Äôm not putting my foot down and saying i‚Äôm committed to the orders i suggested if you are totally opposed to my order suggestion we can keep talking,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,44,Spring,1902
if the italians scare me i don‚Äôt want to worry about you or turkey if the italians keep their word i‚Äôll be fighting turkey not you that‚Äôs why i want you to shift east,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,45,Spring,1902
ok  explain to me why youre in the ionian and not in greece,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,46,Spring,1902
im just very confused why you would  go there instead of greece   i understand the need to selfbounce in budapest but the move to ionian confuses me,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,47,Spring,1902
there are two reasons for austria to have a fleet in the ionian in spring 1902 the first is for austria to attack italy the second is to make it seem like austria is attacking italy when really the target is in either france or turkey i didn‚Äôt go for greece because turkey said he wasn‚Äôt going to go for it last year and leaving it open bought me some good will also i wasn‚Äôt sure if you and italy  were going to screw me so i tried to avoid upsetting any of you regardless of if you believe me turkey‚Äôs armenian flank is exposed and i‚Äôm not in a position to attack you because i built in trie and  hungary  bud is unoccupied,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,48,Spring,1902
also i didn‚Äôt move into gal at the start of the game like i promised and took you at your word when you said you moved into gal because of bad intel,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,49,Spring,1902
alright  well i think youve put yourself way out of position  turkey has asked me to support his attack on serbia and im going to so if italy taps you in trieste and turkey is telling me the truth youll lose it  lets be honest with ourselves if both italy and turkey want to attack austria russia is pretty much always going to join in  maybe turkey is lying to me and is going to work with you to force rumania or something  i doubt it though  i wish you the best of luck and im sorry if things turn out super bad for you  in the future if you ever get the idea to do anything with your fleet other than use it to take greece  you need to crush that good idea fairy quickly  turning it into an extra army through a build is super super important,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,50,Spring,1902
i wish you had defended against the attack i described to you  unfortunately you didnt  any suggestions   youre about to go down a unit,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,51,Fall,1902
you can switch sides and hit bul instead of me italy has access to smyrna and the turkish right flank is still open a rum  bul f sev  arm a gal  ukr a war  ukr you can pick up bul and ank before anyone else is able to mess around,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,52,Fall,1902
you‚Äôll also be able to build another southern fleet if you wanted to,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,53,Fall,1902
i mean this would work a lot better if you had held serbia,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,54,Fall,1902
why didnt you support yourself to hold,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,55,Fall,1902
because you telling me you‚Äôre going to hit a certain territory only lets me know i need to defend something and not what territory in particular so i turtled,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,56,Fall,1902
i suppose i could have been trying to slip into gal and  bud while getting you to just order mutual support orders  but i prefer to order supports to moves i know will go through  i guess i projected that onto you instead of putting myself in your  understandably  paranoid shoes,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,57,Fall,1902
i‚Äôve trusted you before but trusting you and italy at the same time was more than i could do i tried to signal the blue water lepanto without outright telling you do you have any suggestions,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,58,Fall,1902
next time dont do a blue water lepanto  i played facetoface on sunday as russia and austria and italy tried to do a blue water lepanto  i probably could have soloed but i didnt build a fleet sev,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,59,Fall,1902
now a suggestion more specific to this game  let me look at the board,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,60,Fall,1902
it was that or die in year one italy opened asking for a key i‚Äôve never worked well in an austroturkish alliance and the rest almost pushed me to a hedgehog i did what i could,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,61,Fall,1902
ok thats a tough situation,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,62,Fall,1902
and then the asshole in russia opens to galicia  its enough to drive a man to drink,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,63,Fall,1902
i had a bit of tequila tonight,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,64,Fall,1902
ok heres a thought  what if you support me into serbia i move my fleet sevrum and then build a second southern fleet  in the next year i crush into bulgaria you backfill serbia and take greece  rebuilding all the way,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,65,Fall,1902
i know its not ideal for you but  you did the blue water lepanto why not try this,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,66,Fall,1902
yeah i‚Äôll take a fleet in rum all day,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,67,Fall,1902
where do gal and war go,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,68,Fall,1902
west,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,69,Fall,1902
or i could support myself to hold,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,70,Fall,1902
you probably cant afford me lying to you on this one and then doing something with the units that leaves another center exposed,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,71,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm losing a center i‚Äôd prefer gal cleared if you have to eat germany then fine england is off balance if they plan on working with france instead of bottling up in nth and that alliance has to fall apart,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,72,Fall,1902
i have galboh ordered,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,73,Fall,1902
is war going sil or back filling ukr or something i know you could just lie but i still feel like it‚Äôd be negligent for me to not ask,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,74,Fall,1902
actually i could lie to you  but i have given it some thought  i think you genuinely want to work with me  and i actually want to work with you not a big fan of turkey making so many gains  i will move warsil as well,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,75,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm pretty sure turkey is covering smyrna and i‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre convoying apulia to syria,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,76,Fall,1902
you going to keep your southern fleet or give up on the med,1,,1,russia,austria,7,77,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm weighing the f sev build because i don‚Äôt know if we need two fleets back there thoughts,1,False,1,russia,austria,7,78,Fall,1902
you coordinated the shift to serb  greece with turkey and didn‚Äôt need my support if you don‚Äôt build it i‚Äôll assume your 1902 dealing was in bad faith,1,,-1,austria,russia,7,79,Fall,1902
ok i see your point but i cleared galicia,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,80,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm asking if you really think that we need two russian fleets,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,81,Fall,1902
and well  you know what yes yes we do because that‚Äôs what it will take for us to have peace   i ask the right to revisit this pending germany‚Äôs retreat order,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,82,Fall,1902
you can‚Äôt clear the black sea without a second fleet you have two armies on germany‚Äôs border but if we have to revisit it after the retreat then that‚Äôs what we have to do,1,True,-1,austria,russia,7,83,Fall,1902
you know with italy so far out of position you could just run in on him   and yeah ill build the second fleet  if anything it will give you and i three fleets in the med which will be useful for after you take on italy  which is going to happen at some point right  otherwise im not really sure where youd go,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,84,Fall,1902
obviously we need to resolve whats going on in the balkans etc  but i find it useful and beneficial to discuss the long term picture with allies  and after my moves and the build im about to make id like you to consider me an ally  or at least a potential one  what are your impressions of italy  is he a straight shooter with middle management written all over him  do you think you can trust him or work with him after turkey is cracked,1,True,1,russia,austria,7,85,Fall,1902
i had to build up north unfortunately i still think i can slip into the black sea he‚Äôs going to be focused on the south i‚Äôm pretty sure,1,True,4,russia,austria,7,86,Spring,1903
was the bounce in vienna prearranged,1,True,4,russia,austria,7,87,Fall,1903
it doesn‚Äôt look like it was with the fleet move to adriatic,1,True,4,russia,austria,7,88,Fall,1903
the bounce was prearranged,1,True,-4,austria,russia,7,89,Fall,1903
for what it‚Äôs worth italy told me that he was going to attack you this past turn,1,,2,russia,austria,7,90,Spring,1904
but with respect to our border let‚Äôs take bul  and greece off of turkey this turn,1,True,2,russia,austria,7,91,Spring,1904
not sure what we‚Äôre doing together,1,,2,russia,austria,7,92,Spring,1904
i will waste a turn and order defensive moves,1,,2,russia,austria,7,93,Spring,1904
do you have any interest in improving your position andor playing diplomacy  id like to work with you but youre making it extremely difficult by ignoring my messages and not making any suggestions,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,94,Winter,1906
i would like to head south  if you could head in a direction that isnt warsaw i think that we could work together  are you still tied to working with italy or are you open to another path,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,95,Spring,1907
so care to work together i could use some help to keep germany out of warsaw,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,96,Fall,1908
i can‚Äôt support you against the germans directly but i can help against turkey and stay out of sev freeing up another unit,1,False,0,austria,russia,7,97,Fall,1908
i dont understand why you cant help against germany  if its a i want to work with him thing he will head after you once hes done with me  if its a ive got something else for ukr to do    then youre lying to me,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,98,Fall,1908
that‚Äôs really frustrating what italy just did to you it‚Äôs too bad that you‚Äô continued to work with him instead of helping me defend against germany,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,99,Fall,1908
now i can‚Äôt hold anything north of stp that is until france attacks him,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,100,Fall,1908
i mean north of sev,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,101,Fall,1908
are you able to work with me against turkey,1,,0,russia,austria,7,102,Fall,1908
because i‚Äôd like to assume you‚Äôre done working with italy,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,103,Spring,1909
would you like to try to work together here  i havent attacked you the entire game  ive been asking you for help  youve also only replied to one message from me in the past month,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,104,Spring,1909
id be willing to offer you support into warsaw,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,105,Spring,1909
ok if we don‚Äôt all work together france our germany will win,1,True,0,austria,russia,7,106,Spring,1909
how are you going to bury the hatchet with turkey,1,False,0,austria,russia,7,107,Spring,1909
i dont see why thats necessary,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,108,Spring,1909
also because you let germany take warsaw theyre already past the stalemate line  theres really nothing we can do to stop them,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,109,Spring,1909
what we need is for one of them to turn on the other and try to get a solo  but me and turkey patching things up is really inconsequential to the whole thing  especially since he disbanded a fleet,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,110,Spring,1909
my game was ruined the moment i didnt guarantee berlin for myself and instead counted on england to accept my support into kiel  and then england totally fucked my game up  italy going after sevastopol instead of turkish or austrian dots didnt help either and neither did you galavanting into fucking ukraine for no good reason,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,111,Spring,1909
i cant fucking believe people are getting paid to play in this game as a study on communication and no body is fucking communicating  total shit show but thats what you get when you recruit randoms off of reddit,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,112,Spring,1909
anyway this has basically turned into a game of gunboat with you going weeks between replying to my messages italy never responding germany never responding turkey never responding and england never responding,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,113,Spring,1909
and i fully expect to hear back from you sometime after thanksgiving based on your track record  and youll probably fucking lie to me again and screw your own position up even more in the process  since that seems to be your preferred style of play this game,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,114,Spring,1909
the game has been rocky for everyone i stopped responding to you on purpose at the start and then shifted into a screw out after italy didn‚Äôt do anything for three turns,1,False,0,austria,russia,7,115,Spring,1909
so what are you doing with ukraine  right now i have moscow supporting it to warsaw let me know please,1,,0,russia,austria,7,116,Spring,1909
im also supporting myself into bulgaria i suggest you use bulgaria to take greece  or cover budapest  your call   id like to finish off turkey in this go around if you please,1,,0,russia,austria,7,117,Spring,1909
so to wrap things up  ive offered you support into warsaw and  asked you to work with me against turkey  and your response has been that we need to start working together  but you havent indicated in any way shape or form what you plan on doing or what youd like to do together  so basically  im in the same god damned situation with respect to trying to work with you in which ive proposed things we can do together asked for your help or feedback and received nothing but silence in a game where you are getting paid to talk  what the actual  man,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,118,Spring,1909
i have to hit gal because of germany i can not move into war from ukr because of the retreat order  moving from a rum  bul shift your units further out of the german front and will speed the collapse i propose  f black  rum a rum  ukr a ukr  gal a mos  war,1,True,0,austria,russia,7,119,Spring,1909
im not comfortable leaving the black sea and im appalled that you would suggest it  you are continuing to demonstrate no interest in actually working with me,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,120,Spring,1909
i will however not attack bulgaria and move to rumania ukraine as youve requestedsuggested,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,121,Spring,1909
rumania to ukraine,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,122,Spring,1909
ok works for me,1,True,0,austria,russia,7,123,Spring,1909
what are you doing with bulgaria,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,124,Spring,1909
it isn‚Äôt moving,1,,0,austria,russia,7,125,Spring,1909
ok ,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,126,Spring,1909
if turkey moves greece out then i‚Äôll move it i‚Äôm trying to move towards the front,1,True,0,austria,russia,7,127,Spring,1909
is it supporting yourself into greece  is it suppourting con to hold,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,128,Spring,1909
what front,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,129,Spring,1909
germany is already past the stalemate line,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,130,Spring,1909
you cant actually slow him down,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,131,Spring,1909
are you formally included in the franco german alliance if not then that‚Äôs a front he‚Äôs about to move units into position to take mos,1,,0,austria,russia,7,132,Spring,1909
france is already past the stalemate line  you cant actually slow him down either  what we need to so in order to survive this game is to consolidate and defend what we can,1,,0,russia,austria,7,133,Spring,1909
if i can get another build and you can get another build then we can actually slow germany down  my build would come from con and yours would come from greece  can your unit in bulgaria support me from blacon,1,,0,russia,austria,7,134,Spring,1909
i still dont think we can stop him but we can slow him down and maybe get france to attack him  then the game opens wide,1,,0,russia,austria,7,135,Spring,1909
and  i forgot to click submit on my orders update üòû,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,136,Fall,1909
but   you supported con to hold fuck you bro i‚Äôll throw the solo to germany if i can,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,137,Fall,1909
cool,1,,0,austria,russia,7,138,Fall,1909
oh ha  theres only one game year left  none of this shit actually matters,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,139,Fall,1909
we get paid either way and i think the gm said something about a minimum of five centers because of the chat snafu,1,True,0,austria,russia,7,140,Fall,1909
i mean im a little pissed off that youve lied to me since 1902 but  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,141,Fall,1909
minimum of five centers,1,,0,russia,austria,7,142,Fall,1909
mostly just ghosted you everything through 1902 was being ‚Äúsharp ‚Äú with my promises,1,True,0,austria,russia,7,143,Fall,1909
no idea what sharp means  and  no idea why you felt is was appropriate to ghost someone in a game where you are being paid to communicate with other players,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,144,Fall,1909
im thoroughly unimpressed by a lot of the play in this game and even more so in the quality of communication,1,True,0,russia,austria,7,145,Fall,1909
think of sharp conduct as a technically correct malicious compliance type behavior legal but pushing the boundary towards fraud  not responding to something is often a good tactic if you can‚Äôt say anything nice at all then don‚Äôt say anything at all if answering a question or asserting a position is disadvantages to being uncommitted and silent then be silent,1,True,0,austria,russia,7,146,Fall,1909
oh i totally understand the value in the cold shoulder  but you accepted 40 to play in a game of diplomacy that would evaluate the honesty of your correspondence,1,,0,russia,austria,7,147,Fall,1909
in order to keep moscow what is your suggestion,1,,0,russia,austria,7,148,Fall,1909
what a clod you are how in blue fuck does keeping turkey in the game benefit you in the least,1,,-1,russia,austria,7,149,Winter,1909
hello there i realize we may not have a ton to talk about but i‚Äôm curious about your opinion of the game in general also maybe what you think is going on with italy and russia,1,True,0,england,austria,7,0,Spring,1901
i have an opinion on that topic having received press from both but i‚Äôm curious about why you‚Äôd ask,1,True,0,austria,england,7,1,Spring,1901
wanted to know if russia will be playing the north at all obviously you can keep things to yourself if you wish,1,False,0,england,austria,7,2,Spring,1901
i don‚Äôt have any information on the north but depending on what you‚Äôve heard about the italians i might be able to make some informed guesses about the north‚Äôs fate which i couldwould share with you in exchange for that info,1,True,0,austria,england,7,3,Spring,1901
italy didn‚Äôt give me anything to be honest with you but he may in the future i‚Äôd be interested in an exchange but don‚Äôt want to lie to you and give false info i‚Äôll let you know if i learn something,1,True,0,england,austria,7,4,Spring,1901
thank you i‚Äôll let you know if i hear anything about the north,1,True,0,austria,england,7,5,Spring,1901
silence from turkey russia is aggressive and italy is still a mystery those three things make me think juggernaut what are your thoughts,1,True,0,austria,england,7,6,Spring,1901
italy seems to be playing it slow or not sharing their thoughts either way a smart way to play italy since it‚Äôs a little weaker turkey is silent on my end as well but there is a lot of time for that how is russia being aggressive i have heard an aggressive message from him and have also been leaked an aggressive message that he sent to germany allegedly,1,,0,england,austria,7,7,Spring,1901
strongly declared an intention to march into galicia i think the hedgehog is the most popular austrian opening so i don‚Äôt know why russia would make that obvious play i hope italy isn‚Äôt trying to navigate a juggernaut by hitting me that‚Äôs a sure fire way for italy to lose i collapse turkey gets a navy france gets bored and pushes the med to stop turkey and italy gets trapped in the middle,1,True,0,austria,england,7,8,Spring,1901
seems like kind of a dummy he told you all of this,1,True,0,england,austria,7,9,Spring,1901
yes,1,,0,austria,england,7,10,Spring,1901
so he has told me that he wants to march on germany he told germany he wants to push the north against me seems like a wildcard,1,True,0,england,austria,7,11,Spring,1901
hey sorry about this i misread his press about gal he prefers not to bounce there i feel like an idiot and am going to blame using discord instead of backstabbr i could have kept that to myself and profited but i didn‚Äôt because i value your info,1,True,0,austria,england,7,12,Spring,1901
hahaha okay i appreciate the transparency hopefully he doesn‚Äôt come for me in the north,1,True,0,england,austria,7,13,Spring,1901
i‚Äôve heard that france is thinking of forcing bur is that true i would much prefer that didn‚Äôt happen if it is so is there anything you can do to stop it,1,True,0,austria,england,7,14,Spring,1901
yeah france confirmed that it is true that means he‚Äôs probably committed to moving f bre  mao and that you could take the channel at a minimum you can use the channel as leverage for bel,1,True,0,austria,england,7,15,Spring,1901
yes i have heard that he is forcing bur why‚Äôre you worried about france though i‚Äôm not sure if i will enter the channel,1,True,0,england,austria,7,16,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm worried about germany and i‚Äôm worried about russia,1,True,0,austria,england,7,17,Spring,1901
well we will see what happens,1,True,0,england,austria,7,18,Spring,1901
regarding germany and russia france getting 3 centers in 1901 and building that many fleets means it‚Äôll be hard for you to work with him in the longterm also russia is planning on moving into the carpathians and hungary and turkey‚Äòs build in my opinion can only mean that turkey is not concerned with russia because turkey‚Äôs right flank is now completely exposed if you can provide token assistance to germany and hold irish and the channel then you can probably convoy to the north and push on russia up there while most of russia‚Äôs units fight with me i think this is in our best interests because france dominating the seas isn‚Äôt compatible with england in the long run and a turkey russia alliance is quite difficult to stop,1,True,0,austria,england,7,19,Spring,1902
i don‚Äôt want to go against russia right now i think me doing so is merely in your best interest,1,True,0,england,austria,7,20,Spring,1902
ok if a juggernaut does indeed unfold your support would be appreciated i wish you luck with the french fleet,1,True,0,austria,england,7,21,Spring,1902
of course if they seem to be a massive threat then i will respond,1,True,0,england,austria,7,22,Spring,1902
france is moving fleets around spain and getting in position to stab russia is also going to hit germany from the east if you keep attacking germany‚Äôs north you‚Äôll gain denmark and lose yor etc i‚Äôm bringing this up because i have an interest in germany living but at this point so do you,1,True,0,austria,england,7,23,Fall,1902
yeah i see what france is doing,1,,0,england,austria,7,24,Fall,1902
do you also see what i mean about the juggernaut it is happening and they are set to reach the stalemate before you all can even get close to resolving the west,1,True,-2,austria,england,7,25,Spring,1903
yes but there isn‚Äôt anything i can do germany is too irrational to side with me after i initially sided with france against him if he were to agree to a truce then it would be different,1,True,2,england,austria,7,26,Fall,1903
i hate not being able to conference chat  you and germany are about to be eaten by france and russia have you considered coordinating moves in bals or bel,1,True,-2,austria,england,7,27,Fall,1903
germany and i figured some stuff out he‚Äôs pissing me off though because he‚Äôs scared to stab france still working on that,1,,1,england,austria,7,28,Spring,1904
hey turkey i‚Äôm just saying hi and wondering what your thoughts are on rum and gre serb is traditionally austrian territory and bul goes to turkey i‚Äôm just wondering how the russian situation is going to shake out also would you be open to sharing information you hear about me with me in exchange for russian intel,1,True,0,austria,turkey,7,0,Spring,1901
hi i am willing to work with you at least in the intel sharing part i would be happy if we split rum and gre in a way that steers us away from each other,0,True,0,turkey,austria,7,1,Spring,1901
i can‚Äôt speak to the split now but if we do split it me gre you rum i propose that you only put fleets in rum and i only put armies in greece if you‚Äôd rather i put a fleet in that‚Äôs ok too,1,True,0,austria,turkey,7,2,Spring,1901
that is reasonable but then that would mean you and italy fight while it is me against russia what about a reverse i get gre would that work for you at all,1,True,0,turkey,austria,7,3,Spring,1901
why does being in greece commit me to the italian front galicia is crucial to taking russia,1,False,0,austria,turkey,7,4,Spring,1901
because what will italy do in that case he is the eastern power and he will definitely be looking for greece for himself also if you take greece and then commit to fight russia ehat do i get from that you got easy greece for you while i have to fight for everything hopefully you understand my point here,1,False,0,turkey,austria,7,5,Spring,1901
that‚Äôs fair it‚Äôll also make more sense for me to not mess around in greece and build an army while you focus navy if we structure our build types well we can keep the relationship fairly balanced i think i might be able to sneak some italian gains early on and am considering moving that direction if russia stays out of gal in 1901 if it works you won‚Äôt have to worry about a lepanto,0,True,0,austria,turkey,7,6,Spring,1901
okay how this might go then if russia enters galicia that could be a trouble for you and trouble for me,1,True,0,turkey,austria,7,7,Spring,1901
i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to happen if it does i‚Äôll be able to survive long enough for england you or germany to distract him you could always open to armenia,1,True,0,austria,turkey,7,8,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm moving my fleet to alb not for greece but for italy just a heads up,1,True,0,austria,turkey,7,9,Spring,1901
russia has indicated that he is not going to move f sev  rum just letting a friend know so that you can bounce him,1,True,0,austria,turkey,7,10,Spring,1901
okay i will go for rum but he is probably going to support himself there so i reckon galicia is safe,1,False,0,turkey,austria,7,11,Fall,1901
you‚Äôre not going to take greece this turn,1,True,0,austria,turkey,7,12,Fall,1901

i will go for greece,1,True,0,turkey,austria,7,14,Fall,1901
not going to try for rum,1,True,0,austria,turkey,7,15,Fall,1901

do you want support into rum,1,False,0,austria,turkey,7,17,Spring,1902
wow you really think i would fall for that,1,True,0,turkey,austria,7,18,Fall,1902
i am genuinely surprised by your support to serbia do you care to explain or anything,1,True,0,turkey,austria,7,19,Fall,1902
russia asked for it,1,True,0,austria,turkey,7,20,Fall,1902
and you simply accepted it is unusual,1,True,0,turkey,austria,7,21,Fall,1902
he put a fleet in rum and cleared gal which makes bud fairly safe,1,True,0,austria,turkey,7,22,Fall,1902
but he and italy both moved towards vienna they could be working to take you out,1,True,0,turkey,austria,7,23,Fall,1902
could be if that‚Äôs the case i‚Äôm dead anyway,1,True,0,austria,turkey,7,24,Fall,1902

hallo there austria üòÑ,1,True,0,france,austria,7,0,Spring,1901
hey would you mind asking germany to bounce in bur i want him to have an army in mun to scare off the italians and if he‚Äôs going to be stuck in mun bouncing bur he might as well guarantee tyrolia,1,True,0,austria,france,7,1,Spring,1901
sure thing i can ask him but given that you two should be best friends i dont see why it would hurt for you to ask him too,1,True,0,france,austria,7,2,Spring,1901
i did ask him just trying to ensure i‚Äôm protected from italy i‚Äôm a very nervous austria player,1,True,0,austria,france,7,3,Spring,1901
trust in your diplomacy skills üòÑ,1,True,0,france,austria,7,4,Spring,1901
i‚Äôve heard that you plan to force bur,1,True,0,austria,france,7,5,Spring,1901
yes but i do not intend to attack germany with it if im telling the truth about forcing bur im telling the truth about not attacking him,1,False,0,france,austria,7,6,Spring,1901
that sets you off balance if italy moves f nap  tyrs or to pie,1,True,0,austria,france,7,7,Spring,1901
well yes that would suck quite a bit we all know how long the battle for the southern med takes however i guess well see if the pope is into that,1,True,0,france,austria,7,8,Spring,1901
the f nap  tyrs opening is rare but checks in pie are not even if he doesn‚Äôt hit mar he could let bur move into it removing the ability for you to build a fleet there,1,True,0,austria,france,7,9,Spring,1901
what do you want me to do instead is italy coming towards me this spring,1,True,0,france,austria,7,10,Spring,1901
i don‚Äôt know what italy is doing,1,False,0,austria,france,7,11,Spring,1901
well what should i do then are you just worried about your ally germany,1,True,0,france,austria,7,12,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm worried about a lot of stuff not in the western triangle you all seem much more rational than turkey russia and italy a juggernaut is a possibility as is an opening to sil across the board i‚Äôm pushing for predictable play in 1901 so that i can make an informed decision about who to work with if everyone goes with openings that are used  20 of the time then especially as austria i‚Äôm screwed,1,True,0,austria,france,7,13,Spring,1901
just hedgehog and see what happens cant really do much as austria unfortunately,1,True,0,france,austria,7,14,Spring,1901
are you with italy or against italy having a fleet in the ion is pretty useful regardless üòÑ,1,True,2,france,austria,7,15,Spring,1902
i‚Äôm not sure yet lots to think about,0,True,-2,austria,france,7,16,Spring,1902

hi there i always feel like it‚Äôs important for russia and england to have a good relationship i have played too many games where they get in an unnecessary fight that never really helps either one in the long run,1,True,-1,england,russia,7,0,Spring,1901
do you want to go after germany how agressive do you want to be  any suggestions  im open to an early attack on germany,1,False,1,russia,england,7,1,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm always cautious about going in with russia on germany it‚Äôs not an ideal opening for them which makes me cautious are your relations with austria and turkey good enough that you can do that,1,True,-1,england,russia,7,2,Spring,1901
not sure  i actually havent heard anything from turkey yet,1,True,1,russia,england,7,3,Spring,1901
so your plan is to move on germany or was that just a proposal and neither have i,1,True,-1,england,russia,7,4,Spring,1901
no i said im open to moving against germany  you said that you didnt want to fight each other in the north and that we should have a good relationship  if you were going to move against germany early i was letting you know that i would join with you,1,True,1,russia,england,7,5,Spring,1901
makes a lot more sense i would ask what you think about the south but you haven‚Äôt even heard from turkey yet,1,True,-1,england,russia,7,6,Spring,1901
i think im going to have to commit most of my forces to the south  perhaps our best way to partner is to agree to work with each other in principle if anything to keep germany from growing in the north,1,True,1,russia,england,7,7,Spring,1901
that sounds perfect to me and makes a lot more sense we can always look to be more involved in the future,1,True,-1,england,russia,7,8,Spring,1901
good üòä have you heard anything from germany with respect to his feelings towards russia do you think he‚Äôll bounce me in sweden,1,True,1,russia,england,7,9,Spring,1901
i haven‚Äôt asked him we have been talking though,1,False,-1,england,russia,7,10,Spring,1901
no need just curious,1,True,1,russia,england,7,11,Spring,1901
pretty standard openings burgundy was a tad aggressive though thoughts,1,True,1,russia,england,7,12,Fall,1901
didn‚Äôt seem like there was anything crazy i agree that bur was a little aggressive especially with the support i‚Äôm going to try and monitor that situation,1,,-1,england,russia,7,13,Fall,1901
germany just commented to me that he is ‚Äúin position‚Äù to bounce you in sweden if he plans to do so would you be interested in messing with him,1,True,-1,england,russia,7,14,Fall,1901
sure what do you have in mind,0,True,1,russia,england,7,15,Fall,1901
what do you think about you letting him get into swe you go into bal and i take den you would get bounced from sweden anyways and this gives us good position on him later and i would obviously get you sweden in the future,1,True,-1,england,russia,7,16,Fall,1901
do you think he‚Äôs bouncing me if he‚Äôs going to i‚Äôd be interested in those moves,1,True,1,russia,england,7,17,Fall,1901
yes he has confirmed to me that he is,1,False,-1,england,russia,7,18,Fall,1901
i see you built a fleet in london  do you have any concerns about a france that is getting so big  when i get three builds as france i prefer to waive one or two of them but thats my personal preference  let me know if you think youll need an extra build to keep him at bay  im not averse to loaning people centers if its to keep someone from running away with the game  i assume youre planning on attacking germany  clearly i should have trusted you about sweden  but i heard what i wanted to hear from germany and believed the wrong person  lying is not something you can recover from easily in this game,1,True,1,russia,england,7,19,Spring,1902
if you do want to go after germany i would like sweden  and obviously would prefer if you didnt slip into stp while it is undefended,1,True,1,russia,england,7,20,Spring,1902
and obviously i would be willing to help out from the back side  maybe we get you  into denmark this fall,1,True,1,russia,england,7,21,Spring,1902
yeah i am not going to go into stp my moves will help you trust that i understand not trusting me last round that‚Äôs why i didn‚Äôt go through with it since you didn‚Äôt give a hard confirmation i would love support this fall but like you said i will be mobilizing this spring,1,True,-1,england,russia,7,22,Spring,1902
how is your situation in the south any thoughts on austria and turkey,1,True,-1,england,russia,7,23,Spring,1902
they are my neighbors and we‚Äôll probably be squabbling over supply centers before too long,1,True,1,russia,england,7,24,Spring,1902
i would like skag to be the mover can we do that,1,True,1,russia,england,7,25,Fall,1902
whats with france moving to the channel,1,True,1,russia,england,7,26,Fall,1902
i think you have an fg coming your way  but you have my help  i wont go into any of your centers unless you invite me in  this is partly selfish because i know that as soon as germany and france are finished with you germany is headed my way,1,True,1,russia,england,7,27,Fall,1902
ok i‚Äôm meeting someone for dinner but will check this before adjudication right now i‚Äôm supporting skag to denmark if i was france and antienglish i‚Äôd convoy gascony to wales,1,True,1,russia,england,7,28,Fall,1902
yes i can send ska to den the rest of my units will prep for a french stab,1,True,-1,england,russia,7,29,Fall,1902

yeah i need to figure out that whole situation,1,True,-2,england,russia,7,36,Spring,1903
to guarantee berlin i need kiel cut i‚Äôm planning on ordering bal kie if denmark were to support it it could possibly go,1,True,2,russia,england,7,37,Fall,1903

i was even supporting you in  you could have gotten a build,1,True,1,russia,england,7,42,Winter,1903
im really pissed off because i could have easily cut kiel myself and guaranteed my staying even  instead you lied to me and fucked me  when youve got french fleets off of liverpool i dont understand why youd do that but fuck you bro,1,True,1,russia,england,7,43,Winter,1903
and dont give me the bullshit i said i can cut kiel means anything other than ill move on kiel  not only did you not move on kiel you tried to take sweden off of me   what are you thinking  you think a two fleet germany is going to be your longterm friend we could have had him down to two fucking centers with you getting a build  and you went for sweden what the fuck were you thinking  seriously i want to know so that i can understand why you would waste my time like this,1,True,1,russia,england,7,44,Winter,1903
okay first off relax betrayal is part of this game you were looking really strong and i couldn‚Äôt just allow you to take over germany because then i would be sandwiched between you and france without really getting builds myself and before you say you would have let me have some german sc‚Äôs i can‚Äôt trust you on that i need germany on my side of i‚Äôm going to get france off my back and honestly i don‚Äôt know why i feel like i need to explain anything to you england russia alliances never work well for england and i need an ally in the west since france is intent on attacking me i need germany,1,True,-1,england,russia,7,45,Spring,1904
i was getting you into kiel you made a bad decision you ruined my game and you can go fuck yourself,1,True,1,russia,england,7,46,Spring,1904

i am interested in both but for sake of any alliance id go for a bounce,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,7,1,Spring,1901
i agree thats probably for the best  lets see what our neighbors do in 01 perhaps it will open up some opportunities,1,True,1,russia,turkey,7,2,Spring,1901
yes of course the smartest move is that but i would like to work with you the most because at alliance wont work past 1903 and it is just a wild card for me i am not saying we should do juggernaut but maybe juggernaut lite sort of,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,7,3,Spring,1901

if i dont move there it could be obvious to others we are allied but combined with my attack on rum it could assure others we are indeed fighting,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,7,10,Fall,1901
do you still think we need to mask a partnership in my experience playing it cute doesn‚Äôt really mask anything and runs the risk of ceding momentum if you‚Äôre going to attack rumania then i have to move gal to guarantee it and now i‚Äôm not in gal anymore and we don‚Äôt have position on austria,1,True,1,russia,turkey,7,11,Fall,1901

do you think austria and italy are doing a blue water lepanto i think if assistance into rumania was promised you were lied to i‚Äôd like you to build in the south and move your fleet towards the people who are lying to you i‚Äôm willing to support you into serbia if you‚Äôd like,1,True,1,russia,turkey,7,18,Winter,1901
no i wasnt promised rum at all i have been honest to you but yes it could be they are working together serbia sounds juggernautish and it is fine with me,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,7,19,Winter,1901
oh well i‚Äôd prefer to be in galicia but that‚Äôs not how things turned out at least you‚Äôre not in armenia or someplace unrecoverable rumania will support bulgaria to serbia,1,True,1,russia,turkey,7,20,Winter,1901

i can see how you‚Äôd be concerned about rumania and serbia teaming up on bulgaria because i haven‚Äôt discussed this set of moves with austria i didn‚Äôt consider it a threat you needed to protect against i‚Äôm not trying to set you up but i understand if you feel the need to protect your gains please also understand that i‚Äôd like to avoid three turkish units surrounding rumania,1,True,1,russia,turkey,7,23,Spring,1902

i would rather support you in budapest if that works for you i am unsure about my fleet should i defend smy or take gre tgey could go with safer option of convoying to syr,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,7,26,Fall,1902
personally i think they‚Äôll convoy to syria  but that‚Äôs a big one to be wrong about,1,True,1,russia,turkey,7,27,Fall,1902
here‚Äôs the thing you supporting me into budapest won‚Äôt work he‚Äôll triple support it and it will bounce if you support yourself to greece it‚Äôs guaranteed to work and then i‚Äôll probably pick up serbia,1,True,1,russia,turkey,7,28,Fall,1902
i‚Äôd really like to continue working with you but we should both gain from our partnership  not only you gain i think that‚Äôs fair do you see it differently,1,True,1,russia,turkey,7,29,Fall,1902

that worked out well of course you were right about your suggestions i did not predict that austria would move so dangerously after turtling up last turn,1,True,1,russia,turkey,7,33,Fall,1902
ok i asked austria for support into serbia figured he‚Äôd assume i was going anywhere but serbia  i‚Äôm more than a little surprised by his moves his disband will be very telling,1,True,1,russia,turkey,7,34,Fall,1902

nicely done  do you plan on helping england against germany  if youd like the three of us could take down germany together and then you and i team up on england  what are your thoughts on this general strategy  if you agree we can figure out the specific tactics as we go along,1,True,-1,russia,france,7,5,Spring,1902
i‚Äôm up for it although curious about who takes what and how we‚Äôll go about it would love to hear you and england‚Äôs thoughts,1,True,1,france,russia,7,6,Spring,1902
didn‚Äôt england bounce him in holland,1,True,-1,russia,france,7,7,Spring,1902
yes i believe so,1,True,1,france,russia,7,8,Spring,1902
so i‚Äôd say he‚Äôs antigermany,1,True,-1,russia,france,7,9,Spring,1902
yes i wasnt questioning that,1,True,1,france,russia,7,10,Spring,1902
ok,1,True,-1,russia,france,7,11,Spring,1902
are you  are you shifting towards england,1,True,-1,russia,france,7,12,Fall,1902
trying to get germany‚Äôs allegiance don‚Äôt worry i moved to bur for a reason,0,True,1,france,russia,7,13,Fall,1902
would you like to coordinate on munich,1,,-1,russia,france,7,14,Fall,1902
and if you could suggest to germany that he retreats to north sea he could help you against england,1,,-1,russia,france,7,15,Fall,1902
not sure what was the last message that went through to you,1,,-1,russia,france,7,16,Fall,1902
oh man  youve got a germany problem and your fleets are headed the wrong way,1,True,-4,russia,france,7,17,Fall,1907
i got an ai problem ü§∑,1,True,4,france,russia,7,18,Fall,1907
you just took another unit off of him,1,True,-4,russia,france,7,19,Fall,1907
you should be working with austria against germany in my opinion,1,True,-4,russia,france,7,20,Fall,1907
then what about italy,1,True,4,france,russia,7,21,Fall,1907
hell die on the vine  he either keeps his army out east and disbands a unit defending his homeland or he disbands the unit in the east and loses another dot,1,True,-4,russia,france,7,22,Fall,1907
idunno man i‚Äôm trying to help turkey too but you made it a lot more difficult haha,1,True,6,france,russia,7,23,Winter,1907
turkey cant help against germany tho,1,True,-6,russia,france,7,24,Winter,1907
turkey can‚Äôt stab me like italy can tho,1,True,6,france,russia,7,25,Winter,1907
italy will inevitably start to swing west if the austrian alliance holds,1,True,6,france,russia,7,26,Winter,1907
right  where do you think i want to go  obviously west  into germany and austria,1,,-6,russia,france,7,27,Winter,1907
lets see what italy disbands,1,,-6,russia,france,7,28,Winter,1907
it would be lovely if you headed at germany  hes most likely going to send two armies at warsaw so hes going to keep building  but you can just walk into nth andor nwg sea and just hammer him,1,,-6,russia,france,7,29,Spring,1908
are you freeing germany up to attack me or do you have any interest in ‚Äúrounding the horn‚Äù into munich now that you‚Äôre past switzerland,1,,-6,russia,france,7,30,Fall,1908
hi there what‚Äôre your thoughts on the board to start i realize we don‚Äôt have any negotiations to make but i always like to get to know what people are thinking,1,True,0,england,turkey,7,0,Spring,1901
hello as a corner buddies i am certain we will work sometime in the future perhaps to establish a stalemate line,1,True,0,turkey,england,7,1,Spring,1901
just so you know i have heard that russia is planning on moving south not sure if that is on you or on austria,1,True,0,england,turkey,7,2,Spring,1901
well nothing unusual there to be honest here germany is saying me quite opposite of what you have said it is guessing game now,1,True,0,turkey,england,7,3,Spring,1901
yeah i have been getting some vibes that russia is not telling a lot of truths so we will see,1,False,0,england,turkey,7,4,Spring,1901
how not he did move south,1,True,0,turkey,england,7,5,Fall,1901
you are attacking the wrong target russia and france will overrun everyone on the mainland,1,True,0,turkey,england,7,6,Fall,1903
germany refuses to truce with me not much i can do,1,False,0,england,turkey,7,7,Fall,1903
why would he decline truce he said otherwise to me,1,True,0,turkey,england,7,8,Fall,1903
he just told me that it is too late to side with me and that i should basically suicide attack russia so that he doesn‚Äôt die,1,True,0,england,turkey,7,9,Fall,1903
and you two couldnt agree on anything,1,True,0,turkey,england,7,10,Fall,1903
we are talking more next step is getting france off my back so i can actually use my navy,1,True,0,england,turkey,7,11,Fall,1903
hello there england pleasure to meet you üòÑ,1,True,0,france,england,7,0,Spring,1901
you as well i‚Äôd be interested in creating a dmz in the english channel how about you,1,True,0,england,france,7,1,Spring,1901
i would too and i hope you are telling the truth too,1,,0,france,england,7,2,Spring,1901
of course in all honesty i have two fleets so i could force my way in anyways i don‚Äôt want to do that though what about hol bel is obviously yours,1,True,0,england,france,7,3,Spring,1901
i wouldnt say obviously but i certainly wouldnt mind getting bel and helping you into hol if that were the case,1,True,0,france,england,7,4,Spring,1901
obviously that would be great germany would have to be on board though or else we would be making an enemy,1,True,0,england,france,7,5,Spring,1901
by the way i am going to be asking italy and germany about what they think about you i will let you know what they say,1,True,0,england,france,7,6,Spring,1901
sounds good although i would expect germany to expect hol is his which might cause some conflicts,1,,0,france,england,7,7,Spring,1901
ill ask around and do the same for you,0,,0,france,england,7,8,Spring,1901
appreciated,1,True,0,england,france,7,9,Spring,1901
have you reached out with germany tomorrow,1,True,0,england,france,7,10,Spring,1901
yet,1,True,0,england,france,7,11,Spring,1901
i havent yet but ill message him soon,1,True,0,france,england,7,12,Spring,1901
have you heard anything,1,True,0,france,england,7,13,Spring,1901
germany would prefer to ally with me i‚Äôm not interested in that though have you talked to him yet,1,True,0,england,france,7,14,Spring,1901
yes ive talked with him and told him that id move into bur he offered an fg alliance to me as well which makes me doubt his geniuneness,1,True,0,france,england,7,15,Spring,1901
of course good thing we can just take him out,1,True,0,england,france,7,16,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm playing friendly with germany as long as i can should help us get some info or an easy capture,1,True,0,england,france,7,17,Spring,1901
sounds good to me,1,True,0,france,england,7,18,Spring,1901
what areyour thoughts for this season,1,True,0,france,england,7,19,Fall,1901
he‚Äôs worried about you going to munich how do you want to play that i say that i leak to him that you are going there and then you don‚Äôt actually it could let you get into ruh and also keep him from building there,1,True,0,england,france,7,20,Fall,1901
i would love to move on germany with you however moving alone into ruh would be overextending quite a bit,1,True,0,france,england,7,21,Fall,1901
what would you look for me to do to make you feel better about it,1,True,0,england,france,7,22,Fall,1901
bounce hol maybe,1,True,0,france,england,7,23,Fall,1901
if youre gonna get him to cover mun,1,True,0,france,england,7,24,Fall,1901
my other thought and give me your opinion on this is this he told me he might bounce russia in sweden if i can confirm that and get russia to move into bal instead then germany would be stuck in sweden and i could sneak an army into denmark germany would end up getting two builds but we would be in good position and russia would then be involved,1,True,0,england,france,7,25,Fall,1901
hehe that sounds tricky but exciting unfortunately i wont have a big part to play at least this fall but if you can pull it off with russia i dont see why i wouldnt help you guys,1,True,0,france,england,7,26,Fall,1901
you would be in a good position though and have your two builds as well i still have not gotten a 100 on the bounce attempt or heard back from russia that he likes the idea because it does take some trust from russia,1,True,0,england,france,7,27,Fall,1901
the low risk play is to just bounce in hol,1,True,0,england,france,7,28,Fall,1901
i just realized that if you go ruh you can‚Äôt get bel because of the way you opened i apologize for asking that of you what are your thoughts on that,1,True,0,england,france,7,29,Fall,1901
if youre going to bounce hol i can either save bel for later and move ruh or take it and be able to build a brea par for germany and f mar for defense against italy not too sure what id do do you have any thoughts,1,True,0,france,england,7,30,Fall,1901
i would love if you moved into ruh since it would apply some pressure germany told me they would be moving into mun to cover it because it‚Äôs too risky not to,1,True,0,england,france,7,31,Fall,1901
sounds good let me know if you can get the balden situation figured out,1,True,0,france,england,7,32,Fall,1901
yeah if that won‚Äôt work we can play more cautious,1,True,0,england,france,7,33,Fall,1901
f lon eh understandable how to proceed from here,1,True,2,france,england,7,34,Spring,1902
not sure obviously your fleets make me nervous but how do you want to go after germany,1,True,-2,england,france,7,35,Spring,1902
i can support lvp into hol maybe but a bit worried about where lon would go,0,True,2,france,england,7,36,Spring,1902
i will just reposition my fleets this round lon will be headed to nth and i will surround denmark with the other 2,1,True,-2,england,france,7,37,Spring,1902
i see us supporting each other more in the fall,1,True,-2,england,france,7,38,Spring,1902
that sounds good to me ill probably make an advance on bur then,1,True,2,france,england,7,39,Spring,1902
apologies for the fleet in eng needed to go somewhere and now germany trusts me,1,True,2,france,england,7,40,Fall,1902
ill pull out and let you know what hes going to do this season,0,True,2,france,england,7,41,Fall,1902
was going to ask about that so i can trust that you won‚Äôt take lon,1,True,-2,england,france,7,42,Fall,1902
i hope you can but if you need to defend it i dont blame you,1,False,2,france,england,7,43,Fall,1902
do you plan on bringing yor to den,1,False,2,france,england,7,44,Fall,1902
if not you could cover lon with it for peace of mind,1,False,2,france,england,7,45,Fall,1902
germanys told me that hell just support his centers i can cut ruh and support yorhol if nth isnt busy otherwise i might aim for a cheap shot in mun,0,False,2,france,england,7,46,Fall,1902
yeah i‚Äôll take the support thank you,1,,-2,england,france,7,47,Fall,1902
how bout them russians,1,True,1,france,england,7,48,Fall,1903
what about them,1,,-1,england,france,7,49,Fall,1903
any chance that you realize your stab failed and that you‚Äôre gonna back off,1,,-1,england,france,7,50,Fall,1903

things are still shaking out but overall ok france and england seem to be getting along nicely and will likely roll towards us soon,0,True,0,germany,italy,8,1,Fall,1901
france told me his main focus is to take out england before moving towards us but that seems unlikely let‚Äôs watch out for each other,1,True,0,italy,germany,8,2,Fall,1901
üëçüèΩ,1,True,0,germany,italy,8,3,Fall,1901

huh france has been pretty quiet to me so i was assuming france and england were working together have you heard much from france i probably will try to stay neutral with austria a bit longer we will see,1,,-1,italy,germany,8,5,Winter,1901
are you planning to help austria move back to into vie,1,,-1,italy,germany,8,6,Spring,1902

hi austria yes definitely willing to work together,1,False,0,italy,austria,8,1,Spring,1901
did you have anything in mind,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,2,Spring,1901
yes id like to develop to the balkans keeping turkey busy which would allow a lepanto opening from your side,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,3,Spring,1901
ok that works for me,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,4,Spring,1901
have you been able to gather anything from russia yet,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,5,Spring,1901
we chatted yeah hes in for an alliance against turkey,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,6,Spring,1901

happy thanksgiving üôÇ,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,14,Fall,1901
i think it would be best to keep up the picture that there is some friction between us,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,15,Fall,1901
if you are planning a lepanto this would be the better course,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,16,Fall,1901
do you want to bounce in tri again,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,17,Fall,1901

ugh that was a rough one üò¶,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,22,Winter,1901

sounds good üëç,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,26,Winter,1901

ive tried to give the impression that we have a quibble,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,30,Spring,1902
im checking with g to see if you can help with vie would you be interested,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,31,Spring,1902
ok thanks for the heads up yeah turkey thinks i‚Äôm on his side but i assume that will change very soon haha what were you thinking for vie i‚Äôm interested in helping,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,32,Spring,1902
i want to smooth this over with g before you do anything that may seem aggressive but i was thinking you move to tyr then you can support my move to vie in fall,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,33,Spring,1902
though i wonder if g will respond before the deadline,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,34,Spring,1902
yeah i haven‚Äôt heard back from germany in a while,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,35,Spring,1902
ok keep me updated,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,36,Spring,1902

oh f allied with g  e hm,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,38,Fall,1902
do you want to try the risky play of convoying to smy or go to syr first i can try to fool t supposedly hes asking what youre planning,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,39,Fall,1902
does t really not know or is it feigned ignorance,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,40,Fall,1902
i was thinking syr firstwith my fleets there i doubt t will trust me enough not move back to smy i‚Äôm sure turkey can tell what i‚Äôm doing at this point but is definitely annoyed at me he offered a deal that he would only build armies from now on if i only built fleets which i agreed to other than that we hadn‚Äôt really worked together but because of that agreement he seems to assume i would feel indebted to him,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,41,Fall,1902
im pretty sure he was aware because he said hed build two fleets if id give them greece,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,42,Fall,1902
ah well it would be nice to have support from your fleet when i move from syr to smy hopefully net spring but if you feel that you need to hold in greece i totally understand too,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,43,Fall,1902
im considering moving into bul if that is cleared i can move f gre aeg,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,44,Fall,1902
ok üëç,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,45,Fall,1902
welp i‚Äôm done for let me know your plans for tri and i‚Äôll try to leave you with ven,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,46,Fall,1902
we can get you smy by fall while you pull back ion,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,47,Spring,1903
will you be able to support from aeg if so i can support you into aeg this season,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,48,Spring,1903
you dont need to if you support move into smy t has to hold or support with f smy,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,49,Spring,1903
but yes thats my plan,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,50,Spring,1903
ok perfect,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,51,Spring,1903
thanks,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,52,Spring,1903
we‚Äôre all the moves through the balkans with turkey coordinated,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,53,Fall,1903
were,1,True,0,italy,austria,8,54,Fall,1903
sorry for being mia while at this critical stage these days went quick,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,55,Fall,1903
im surprised to see youd choose to stab me at this point couldve conquered turkey by 1904 which would give you 2 and me 1 cp,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,56,Fall,1903
from there sev is not a stretch since turkey is easily defended,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,57,Fall,1903
now you have gre which will be conquered by t next year im disappointed,1,True,0,austria,italy,8,58,Fall,1903
sorry  i was worried cause i didn‚Äôt hear from you,1,False,0,italy,austria,8,59,Fall,1903
left tri so you still have two units this year if you would accept this as a piece offering maybe we can coordinate again next season,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,60,Winter,1903
thanks ill see if i can come back somehow but i think t will be too strong at this point,1,True,-1,austria,italy,8,61,Winter,1903
perhaps we can convince r to fight turkey,1,True,-1,austria,italy,8,62,Winter,1903
we can try to push into ser if a ser  tri,1,True,-1,austria,italy,8,63,Winter,1903
yeah ser is probably our best bet,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,64,Winter,1903
do you have a feel for how much russia would be willing to cooperate i feel like tr are working pretty closely,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,65,Winter,1903
low at this point doubt theyd want an extra front without being in a good position for a stab,1,True,-1,austria,italy,8,66,Winter,1903
though if we drag it on long enough t might stab r,1,True,-1,austria,italy,8,67,Winter,1903
t says hed support me to albania maybe you can move albti with support from france france made it seem like hed be on your side there then maybe well be in a better position to have a go at serbia,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,68,Spring,1904
im worried to leave are open but i dont really have other options haha,1,False,1,italy,austria,8,69,Spring,1904
i guess ionalb but then i have no way of defending home scs,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,70,Spring,1904
anyways let me know what you think i have a final exam this evening so i probably wont be on again until later this evening fyi,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,71,Spring,1904
oops meant leave gre open,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,72,Spring,1904
why would you want to move from gre to alb that doesnt make sense to me but only if t thinks youd just abandon gre for no reason,1,True,-1,austria,italy,8,73,Spring,1904
i was thinking about setting up a convoy back to venice,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,74,Spring,1904
i assume you are trying to move back to tri,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,75,Spring,1904
never mind,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,76,Spring,1904
ok i am going to move up to alb this season made deal with turkey best case scenario i convoy him out of greece next year and he supports me to push back at france worst maybe too likely case i am just handing turkey supply centers but he will be able to get greece in a season or two either way,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,77,Spring,1904
i cant afford to just use f ion to constantly support greece or else france will keep marching down italy,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,78,Spring,1904
sure if youre doing that then ill need to change my plans i was hoping to attack ser with your support,1,True,-1,austria,italy,8,79,Spring,1904
in this case and also previous season i think the best defense would be a good offense,1,True,-1,austria,italy,8,80,Spring,1904
yeah basically this is what would happen,1,True,-1,austria,italy,8,81,Spring,1904
sorry üò¶ let me know if you need support from adriatic and i could retreat there,1,True,1,italy,austria,8,82,Spring,1904

not yet  we have to actually process a couple moves before i can gather any dots from them oh you meant information  turkeys not super talkative seems to be looking at traditional boring turkish openings  austria strikes me as the kind of guy who probably messages every person on the board with an opening proffer of hey  do you want to ally against mutual neighbor,1,True,1,russia,italy,8,3,Spring,1901
yes i‚Äôve only gathered the same from both of them i suppose their dynamics will be more clear after a few moves let‚Äôs keep each other updated,1,True,-1,italy,russia,8,4,Spring,1901

do you have a preference of where youd like to go  when i play italy i always try to figure out where my 5th build is going to be  as long as its not one of mine i dont think a strong italy is necessarily a bad thing for turkey,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,0,Spring,1901

of course,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,2,Spring,1901
any thoughts on how youd like to handle things in the east  i know it can be a classic ai versus rt  what would you need to see  to prevent that  other than me opening to armenia thats a little bold for me,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,3,Spring,1901
was the bounce in venice arranged  are you actively antiaustrian,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,4,Fall,1901
gah didn‚Äôt go as planned i am not sure if austria wants to work with me what‚Äôs your read russia seems neutral at this point,1,True,0,italy,turkey,8,5,Fall,1901
i‚Äôd be open to a joint attack on greece,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,6,Fall,1901
well  austrias pretty much toast  thoughts,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,7,Winter,1901
yeah it seems like it i think austria was trying to work with russia which was clearly a mistake,1,True,0,italy,turkey,8,8,Winter,1901
i offered him a great deal but he decided to drop his pants for russia  very frustrating to see in what is supposed to be a high quality game  oh well  i am planning on building a fleet and heading into the agean  that is as far west as i plan on going if youd like to work together  i offer you the following  i build only armies from here on out  i think you might need a third army but id ask you to build only fleets beyond that army  france looks like hes going to be a bit slow in moving out on you so maybe with a bunch of fleets and a head start you can get the jump on him,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,9,Winter,1901
yeah that‚Äôs reasonable i can work with that,1,True,0,italy,turkey,8,10,Winter,1901
ok so you don‚Äôt have a problem with me taking greece while you focus on trieste,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,11,Winter,1901

i think you me and he are all on the same page with respect to austria,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,13,Winter,1901
hi  why are your fleets in my area how are they helping you take shots off of austria and  or defend against france what threat did i pose you when i promised to only build armies from here on out trying to figure out what you‚Äôre thinking so that we can work together,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,14,Fall,1902
a i think its bullshit that in a game where were being compensated to communicate with each other you ignore me for an entire season b do you even look at the board before you put in your orders  youre not getting any of my dots brother  and france is about to take at least two off of you,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,15,Fall,1902
well i‚Äôm going to lose this game anyways so   a just because i didn‚Äôt chat with you doesn‚Äôt mean i didn‚Äôt talk with others b im fairly new to diplomacy and never played as italy before honestly just bruteforced the lepanto because of a lack of creativity on my part sorry to be an annoying neighbor best of luck moving forward,1,True,0,italy,turkey,8,16,Fall,1902
well if they give bonus points for honesty you just got some  anyway if you had partnered with me and moved on trieste youd be getting a build right now  sometimes you need to adjust your game based on the conditions on the board  also as italy i never lepanto   well never say never  but the convoy to syrna  theres got to be a specific set of circumstances that result in that   and france not being aggressive and austria letting me have trieste are two of them,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,17,Fall,1902
you live and you learn,1,,0,italy,turkey,8,18,Fall,1902
or you read one of the dozens of strategy articles for italy that are on the internet,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,19,Fall,1902
and out of curiosity why or who were you talking to while ignoring me  you coordinated absolutely none of your moves with anybody else and somebody convoyed into your home territory  id say you invested your diplomacy down a dry hole brother,1,True,0,turkey,italy,8,20,Fall,1902
so  another french fleet,1,True,1,turkey,italy,8,21,Spring,1903
yeah obviously i dont trust him but he says its going to be used to attack england,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,8,22,Spring,1903
i suppose no matter what he told me id tell you that hes attacking you    but hes going to keep attacking you,1,True,1,turkey,italy,8,23,Spring,1903
right,1,,-1,italy,turkey,8,24,Spring,1903
you need a 5th build and i border both greece and trieste  maybe you can get your 5th build from one of them and i could help you out  im just worried that youre going to cripple me while france cripples you  but if we can work together against a common neighbor then we can both gain,1,True,1,turkey,italy,8,25,Spring,1903
maybe i‚Äôll go for tri i think that austria and germany were trying to coordinate to push back at russia in vie i‚Äôll try to gather more info from austria if that‚Äôs still in the works might be able to get to tri easily while he‚Äôs preoccupied with that,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,8,26,Spring,1903
you will probably want to cover rome  im hoping that you convoy back to your peninsula so that you can defend your home centers  i dont know how youre going to cover everything  if i was france i would probably see if youre going to stalemate me or not  if you dont stalemate me then ill take everything i can  if you do then ill reposture towards germany,1,True,1,turkey,italy,8,27,Spring,1903
but regardless im going to protect my home centers from you  so id ask you not to dedicate 3 out of your 4 units to get one of my home dots while in the process you lose two of yours,1,True,1,turkey,italy,8,28,Spring,1903
yeah that sounds reasonable,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,8,29,Spring,1903
agreed it sounds reasonable  i just hope that you are reasonable üôÇ,1,True,1,turkey,italy,8,30,Spring,1903

youll lose one center to him at least  i really dont understand your play,1,True,1,turkey,italy,8,32,Fall,1903
actually youll lose two  youll lose trieste and tunis  you jackass,1,True,1,turkey,italy,8,33,Fall,1903
i had a deal with france risky i know,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,8,34,Fall,1903

i don‚Äôt have a preference at the moment,1,True,-1,italy,turkey,8,58,Fall,1903
ok heres my pitch to you  i can replace your fleet with one that i build but i cant replace your army in greece  so ill build a fleet and ask you to disband the one in eastern med  then well work together to get you into trieste which will make up for losing rome and give you a shot at getting venice back  otherwise youre just going to get caught in the sandwich between france and me with a dying austria trying to get back into things,1,True,3,turkey,italy,8,59,Winter,1903
ok that sounds good to me i have my order in to disband eas   since i didn‚Äôt retreat into tri i‚Äôm trying to leverage that into some coordination from austria on their way out  not holding my breath though but will keep you posted,1,True,-3,italy,turkey,8,60,Winter,1903

is france playing us,1,True,1,germany,england,8,7,Fall,1902
thats a good question whats he telling you,1,,-1,england,germany,8,8,Fall,1902
he asked for support in exchange for staying off my back,1,True,1,germany,england,8,9,Fall,1902
you,1,True,1,germany,england,8,10,Fall,1902
,1,True,1,germany,england,8,11,Fall,1902
he also offered me support oy,1,True,-1,england,germany,8,12,Fall,1902
well what should we do about that,1,True,1,germany,england,8,13,Fall,1902
i could support you into belgium,0,False,-1,england,germany,8,14,Fall,1902

it seems you have unreliable allies,1,True,1,germany,england,8,17,Spring,1903
quite a few of them,1,True,-1,england,germany,8,18,Spring,1903
well hello there  hope youre having a lovely thanksgiving  are you going to bounce russia in sweden,1,True,0,turkey,germany,8,0,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm still undecided where do you stand with russia and austria,1,True,0,germany,turkey,8,1,Fall,1901
not sure austria is feeling things out and russia says he‚Äôs supporting himself into rum,1,True,0,turkey,germany,8,2,Fall,1901
are you planning on throwing the game to france  i think that you really need to consider defense,1,True,0,turkey,germany,8,3,Spring,1904
i‚Äôm trying to deal with russia to stop you and him from steam rolling west if you‚Äôre willing to turn on russia i would be open to turning on france,1,True,0,germany,turkey,8,4,Fall,1904
alright you make an excellent point  this year i will turn on russia  but you need to fight france hes on 11 is guaranteed england eventually and then youre in to position to stop him from getting another 4 for the solo  you should demand part of england or at least bel to keep the two of you even  if he refuses then you know what hes about,1,False,0,turkey,germany,8,5,Fall,1904
so how much of england are you getting  or is he letting you take belgium,1,True,0,turkey,germany,8,6,Winter,1904
oh my  he has no armies,1,True,0,turkey,germany,8,7,Spring,1905
i‚Äôm getting belgium,1,True,0,germany,turkey,8,8,Spring,1905
good for you  and you should be getting stp too,1,,0,turkey,germany,8,9,Spring,1905
it would appear that belgium was not really going to be yours,1,,0,turkey,germany,8,10,Fall,1905
yep  no belgium for you  think hell let you have it this year  will he waive any of his builds,1,,0,turkey,germany,8,11,Winter,1905
in all seriousness if youre willing to prevent the solo im sure russia will listen to reason,1,,0,turkey,germany,8,12,Winter,1905
i reached out to russia let‚Äôs see what he says,1,True,0,germany,turkey,8,13,Spring,1906
russia seems to be open to working together to stop france what has he told you   i should take a dot off of him this turn with more to follow shortly,1,True,0,turkey,germany,8,14,Fall,1906
he hasn‚Äôt answered me,1,True,0,germany,turkey,8,15,Fall,1906
he just replied to me so maybe there‚Äôs something in your inbox i wouldn‚Äôt totally open my back door to him though,1,True,0,turkey,germany,8,16,Fall,1906
he‚Äôs bitter not sounding like i can count on him,1,True,0,germany,turkey,8,17,Fall,1906
most of us out bitter bitter men,0,True,0,turkey,germany,8,18,Fall,1906
are,1,True,0,turkey,germany,8,19,Fall,1906
ughhh that was a unfortunate retreat by france,1,True,1,turkey,germany,8,20,Winter,1906
are you still holding tight with russia france and russia will squeeze me and then you i think it‚Äôs mutually beneficial for us to work closer together,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,8,21,Spring,1907
maybe but this game ends in three years,1,True,1,turkey,germany,8,22,Spring,1907
what were you thinking,1,,1,turkey,germany,8,23,Spring,1907
i‚Äôd be interested in your thoughts,1,True,1,turkey,germany,8,24,Spring,1907
i was thinking i help you take vienna budapest and sevestapol and i take moscow and warsaw that is if i don‚Äôt get clobbered by russia and france first,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,8,25,Spring,1907
im a little disappointed that you would wait until midnight to message me a response but  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   allinall that sounds good  i think france is about to turtle in the south and youre going to lose a lot of dots  but well see,1,True,1,turkey,germany,8,26,Spring,1907
sorry i‚Äôm in gmt2 and just woke up,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,8,27,Fall,1907
oh thats a little exciting  didnt realize,1,True,1,turkey,germany,8,28,Fall,1907
i see you‚Äôve solidified your partnership with russia i think i‚Äôm going to throw my dots to russia just to spite france good luck,1,True,-1,germany,turkey,8,29,Fall,1907
that‚Äôs fine,1,,1,turkey,germany,8,30,Fall,1907

why do you always assume it‚Äôs me,1,True,-10,germany,turkey,8,35,Fall,1910
i‚Äôm in,1,True,-10,germany,turkey,8,36,Fall,1910
because ive had conversations with everyone else,1,,10,turkey,germany,8,37,Fall,1910
and i forget that youre in europe üôÇ,1,True,10,turkey,germany,8,38,Fall,1910
i‚Äôm never the straggler,1,True,-10,germany,turkey,8,39,Fall,1910
then my sincerest apologies  would you mind double checking though,1,True,10,turkey,germany,8,40,Fall,1910
yup in,1,True,-10,germany,turkey,8,41,Fall,1910
üëå,1,,10,turkey,germany,8,42,Fall,1910
good game brother  sorry it didnt end better for you,1,,10,turkey,germany,8,43,Fall,1910
hi germany id love for us to start out on the right footlet me know if youd like to discuss the three bs burgundy belgium and britain or anything else for that matter üôÇ,1,True,0,france,germany,8,0,Spring,1901
yes i‚Äôd be more than happy to discuss this,1,True,0,germany,france,8,1,Spring,1901
i haven‚Äôt spoken with england yet but i‚Äôm in favor of an equal split of belgium and holland between us i‚Äôd like to open against russia so if we can agree to dmz burgundy that will also free you up to focus on either england or italy what do you think,1,True,0,germany,france,8,2,Spring,1901
when you say ‚Äúsplit of bel and hol between us‚Äù does ‚Äúus‚Äù mean you and me if so then you‚Äôre suggesting exactly what i was going to suggest that also goes for the bur dmz i‚Äôve also not heard anything from britain yet but i‚Äôll let you know if i do,1,True,0,france,germany,8,3,Spring,1901
it‚Äôs nice that we‚Äôre on the same wavelength,1,True,0,germany,france,8,4,Spring,1901
i think so too,1,True,0,france,germany,8,5,Spring,1901
england is not playing very nice,1,True,0,germany,france,8,6,Winter,1901
if you plan on building an army in paris i can support you into belgium in the spring im assuming there that your going to move into the channel in the fall what are your thoughts,1,True,0,germany,france,8,7,Winter,1901
im waiting to look at the winter builds to be sure but i think i might focus my energy on the south to start out id appreciate the support into belgium but not sure why it requires a parisian army,0,,0,france,germany,8,8,Winter,1901
again i was assuming your fleet is moving into the channel but just let me know where you want the support from,1,True,0,germany,france,8,9,Spring,1902
thanks for the help now is there anything i can help you with,1,,0,france,germany,8,10,Fall,1902
now that you mention it going after england now would be grand,1,True,0,germany,france,8,11,Fall,1902
keep this between us but my plan was to wait til i could build another fleet and launch my offensive in spring but i take it thats not soon enough for you,1,False,0,france,germany,8,12,Fall,1902
you do whatever you think best but after you getting double support from both me and england trust is a little bit of an issue right now  a strong move towards england would help me settle down,1,True,0,germany,france,8,13,Fall,1902
well if it‚Äôs any consolation i‚Äôm reneging on an agreement to support england convoying to holland,1,True,0,france,germany,8,14,Fall,1902
yeesh i‚Äôm quite nervous about a russia in cahoots with england and turkey in the face of this i‚Äôd like you and me to coordinate more if you‚Äôre willing to trust me,1,True,0,france,germany,8,15,Fall,1902
that‚Äôs all i‚Äôve been looking for from the start you‚Äôve pushed full force into italy but i think we can still turn around go north,1,True,-1,germany,france,8,16,Winter,1902
turning around is a little extreme but im building a fleet it brest and so between that and belgium you and i could take nth andor the channel,1,True,1,france,germany,8,17,Winter,1902
i just offered italy a deal that would allow me to send one fleet back up north if italy agrees then you and i will really be in business,1,True,1,france,germany,8,18,Winter,1902
excellent i hope they agree,1,True,-1,germany,france,8,19,Winter,1902
are you talking to england at all i know that if i were england and faced with an unreliable france i‚Äôd make overtures to germany and plot with them,1,True,1,france,germany,8,20,Spring,1903
of course he‚Äôs trying to convince me to take belgium with his support i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise for us to not work together right now the threat of england and russia is too great i‚Äôm still committed to this partnership so long as you are,0,False,-1,germany,france,8,21,Spring,1903
i am committed just wanted some clues about what england might really intend i offered e support into hol again this season just to see if they‚Äôd refuse it or agree to it and they agreed but neither of e‚Äôs stated goals involve moving to the channel so i‚Äôm thinking it may be feasible for me to move bre there unsupported and have bel support den into nth if you think that‚Äôs a good idea  also i‚Äôd understand if you were thinking if collaborating with e against me but i think long term i can offer you more because i‚Äôll have northern and southern footholds from which to support you in taking over centraleast europe,1,True,1,france,germany,8,22,Spring,1903
you‚Äôve got a way into the channel now what‚Äôs your agreement with italy he‚Äôs very vulnerable right now,1,True,-1,germany,france,8,23,Spring,1903
i‚Äôve decided to try and press my advantage while i have it but keep that between us üòâ,1,True,1,france,germany,8,24,Spring,1903
yeah i couldn‚Äôt imagine he was offering anything more valuable than your position now,1,True,-1,germany,france,8,25,Spring,1903
that turn went well for us if you cut support from norway i‚Äôll take nth,1,,1,france,germany,8,26,Fall,1903
also are you planning to help a hold vienna,1,True,1,france,germany,8,27,Fall,1903
went well for us indeed  i was going to force my way into gob but i guess it would be better to force north sea  will you support me into norway once youre there  still undecided about austria,1,True,-1,germany,france,8,28,Fall,1903
i can offer you that support but england will almost certainly cut it from edinwg  i think its in your interest to help a since everything a loses will end up with turssia which is a greater threat to you,1,True,1,france,germany,8,29,Fall,1903
how about i convoy denyork or holyork in spring then support swenwy in fall,1,True,2,france,germany,8,30,Winter,1903
asking now since it may affect what you build,1,True,2,france,germany,8,31,Winter,1903
i don‚Äôt think landing an army in england is going to be beneficial to us plus i have russia breathing down my neck i need to push east,1,True,-2,germany,france,8,32,Winter,1903
okay fair enoughthough it looks to me like youre doing more neckbreathing than russia at the moment üòõ,1,True,2,france,germany,8,33,Winter,1903
i hope that continues russia has been very anti france he keeps telling me that he‚Äôs waiting for me and england to band together against you before moving west,1,True,-2,germany,france,8,34,Spring,1904
i keep waiting for that too honestly but my progress is about to hit a wall now that italy‚Äôs got nothing to do but fight me back furthermore you‚Äôll need all the resources we can get to stop a russiaturkey victory and i‚Äôm better equipped to help stop that than england is,1,True,2,france,germany,8,35,Spring,1904
i‚Äôm in it with you just look at my positioning you have the upper hand over me if you want to stab you easily can i‚Äôd like to pull off a fg win never managed it before,1,True,-2,germany,france,8,36,Spring,1904
i should have warned you i wasn‚Äôt supporting my hold in nth we could have coordinated that better at any rate do you want me to support skanwy i will if you‚Äôll use that fleet to help me next year,1,True,2,france,germany,8,37,Fall,1904
yeah that was a bit of a miss by us  ill 100 take support from skag to norway  happy to help once im in,1,True,-2,germany,france,8,38,Fall,1904
wait can you actually support sweden in  i need skag to cover denmark  i can still supprort you from den or skag,1,True,-2,germany,france,8,39,Fall,1904
the swe army can also cover den  i‚Äôd prefer the fleet in nwy because then it can support things in nwg if necesssary,1,True,2,france,germany,8,40,Fall,1904
ok,1,True,-2,germany,france,8,41,Fall,1904
alright thanks order‚Äôs placed,1,True,2,france,germany,8,42,Fall,1904
ok so there‚Äôs a lot of pressure from just about everyone for me to turn on you i‚Äôm still interested in working together do you think we can get closer to center parity you will be taking all of england and i‚Äôm hoping to be able to divvy up some of it with you how do you feel about letting go of belgium,1,True,-3,germany,france,8,43,Winter,1904
i‚Äôm willing to,1,False,3,france,germany,8,44,Winter,1904
why the army in munich instead of a fleet in kiel,1,True,3,france,germany,8,45,Spring,1905
im sorry but with turkey squaring up to steal italy out from under me and probably roping austria in to help i need two builds this turn ill hand over belgium next year,1,False,3,france,germany,8,46,Fall,1905
ok so this season you let me in,1,True,-3,germany,france,8,47,Fall,1905
no spring of 1906,1,False,3,france,germany,8,48,Fall,1905
okay clearly i don‚Äôt have your trust but really i am committed to an fg victory i‚Äôm convoying bel onto britain this spring and i‚Äôll leave it open for you just let me know what else you‚Äôd like me to do or if you‚Äôd like to hear about my moves in more detail although in that case i would ask you to reciprocate my main focus for the time being though has to be keeping turkey off my boot,1,,4,france,germany,8,49,Winter,1905
why the 2 army builds,1,,-4,germany,france,8,50,Spring,1906
hi russia can we chat about a possible alliance against turkey,1,True,-1,austria,russia,8,0,Spring,1901
of course we can,1,True,1,russia,austria,8,1,Spring,1901
im opening pretty standard south opening so can certainly focus on turkey,1,True,1,russia,austria,8,2,Spring,1901
sure id welcome a move to ukr,1,True,-1,austria,russia,8,3,Spring,1901
indeed a strong southern deployment do you need assistance somewhere,1,True,-1,austria,russia,8,4,Fall,1901
not yet  but that western opening is irksome,1,True,1,russia,austria,8,5,Fall,1901
you mean englands yeah hes going to try to push into stp,1,True,-1,austria,russia,8,6,Fall,1901
i mean all of it smells of collusion and unfortunately not with russia,1,True,1,russia,austria,8,7,Fall,1901
you think g and e are working together yeah quite possible,1,True,-1,austria,russia,8,8,Fall,1901
what are your plans surrounding rum,1,True,-1,austria,russia,8,9,Fall,1901
turkey is asking me to give them greece,1,True,-1,austria,russia,8,10,Fall,1901
im planning on taking rum  hard to grow without it  personally id prefer you didnt give turkey an extra build but if hes making a strong antiitaly commitment i suppose i could go focus on the north which is clearly what england wants me to do anyway,1,False,1,russia,austria,8,11,Fall,1901
yeah i feel the same way about give t greece,1,True,-1,austria,russia,8,12,Fall,1901
so awkward position but e  g working together must change our priorities somewhat id say,1,True,-2,austria,russia,8,13,Fall,1902
indeed i already told turkey my attention needed to shift north,1,,2,russia,austria,8,14,Fall,1902
do you trust turkey to stay your ally in this situation,1,True,-3,austria,russia,8,15,Spring,1905
about as long as it remains in his interest,1,,3,russia,austria,8,16,Fall,1905
hey england were pretty far apart but i hope we can share some relevant intel here or there,1,True,0,austria,england,8,0,Spring,1901
if theres anything i hear that i think youll benefit by knowing ill pass it along,1,True,0,england,austria,8,1,Spring,1901
greetings  id like to keep our options open for working together i think austriaturkey can be a strong early game partnership  and with the right conditions  a mid to end game one as well  best of luck with regards to galicia and trieste i can let you know if i hear anything,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,0,Spring,1901
hi turkey sounds good turkey is close to my heart and i know it can be a very strong ally,1,True,0,austria,turkey,8,1,Spring,1901
we could always both get 2 builds and stymie russia in this scenario i would only ever build fleets obviously it depends on what our neighbors do but could you trust me that greece would be a walkin,1,False,0,turkey,austria,8,2,Spring,1901
greece may be a stretch i do need to watch what italy does,1,True,0,austria,turkey,8,3,Spring,1901
i know and its always lovely to promise turkey support into rumania and then just let him bounce against russia while you guarantee greece  but if youd like to work together the trust needs to start at some point between us,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,4,Spring,1901
im sorry i mustve misunderstood your intentions i thought you meant for me to walk into greece unsupported,1,True,0,austria,turkey,8,5,Spring,1901
well i was wondering if youd be open to keeping russia out of rumania  but that would involve walking into greece unsupported  unless you thought you could make it to budapest,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,6,Spring,1901
my statement was with regards to my fleet on tri i may not be able to move it to gre in time,0,True,0,austria,turkey,8,7,Spring,1901
i may need it to bump vie,0,True,0,austria,turkey,8,8,Spring,1901
interesting  ive never seen that before  and would love to hear your thoughts on it  though i assume you mean bump venice,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,9,Spring,1901
yeah thats right,1,True,0,austria,turkey,8,10,Spring,1901
its purely defensive,1,True,0,austria,turkey,8,11,Spring,1901
you think hes going for tyrolia and venice,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,12,Spring,1901
that is the standard opening against a,1,True,0,austria,turkey,8,13,Spring,1901
ughhh sorry to hear that brother,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,14,Spring,1901
best of luck i have received no indications from italy or russia how they plan to move i hope any guesses you have to make work out for the best,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,15,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm haven‚Äôt done a good at in a while want to make a go of it,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,16,Fall,1901
so rum for gre,1,True,0,austria,turkey,8,17,Fall,1901
oh he has 2 support now ,1,True,0,austria,turkey,8,18,Fall,1901
not sure what your suggesting our fall moves to be,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,19,Fall,1901
but yes you let me have greece i‚Äôll build two fleets and we‚Äôll get you into rumania in ‚Äò02 that way your fleet can cover trieste and your armies can bounce in budapest,1,False,0,turkey,austria,8,20,Fall,1901
preliminarily im considering stabbing gal with vie then s ser bul  rum which could bounce if f sev s ukr  rum but that would give you bla,1,True,0,austria,turkey,8,21,Fall,1901
that could work as well,1,False,0,turkey,austria,8,22,Fall,1901
you should chat with others and double back we can talk on turkey day,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,23,Fall,1901

hows it going  did you have a great thanksgiving,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,25,Fall,1901
id like to coordinate respecting this seasons moves   heres my pitch  let me into greece ill build two fleets ill have gotten my 5th build from greece and will never ask for another center again  i mean how often does turkey italy and austria fight over greece  lets just remove that from the equation  instead you either use your fleet to cover trieste or head into adriatic  boom my fleets come pouring in youve got the extra unit for support for the attack on venice ill be in the black sea  we get you into rumania in 02 maybe you get venice in 02 and maybe you help me into sevastopol so that i can keep building fleets  its a little unorthodox but with italy trying for venice and russia in galicia  im trying to be your friend but also pitching something that makes sense for me    thoughts,1,False,0,turkey,austria,8,26,Fall,1901
really i wouldnt mind moving into venice at some point but i feel like with this plan im sticking my neck out really far,1,True,0,austria,turkey,8,27,Fall,1901
like  how far cause you need friends and italy and russia i assume both lies to you and attacked you me i prefer to find a partner that i‚Äôm a principled negotiator i like to find a partner with whom i can negotiate in good faith and work with long term    a fleet in greece is great for attacking turkey not so much against italy  if we have three fleets against two italian fleets we can take him  quick also if i‚Äôm in the black sea i can help you against rumania   i‚Äôd ask you to consider this  you can gain two neutrals and lose one of your home centers for a net of four or you can protect your home centers gain one and get position on the guy who attacked you  and earn an ally i think that‚Äôs a very fair prospect,1,False,0,turkey,austria,8,28,Fall,1901
ok clearly you chose the forget the guy thats trying to negotiate with me in good faith and instead ill drop my pants to my ankles for the guys that are lying to me  i get it its cool  it doesnt mean i cant get annoyed though  let me know if youd like to negotiate in good faith  otherwise good luck playing defense against a two build russia  ill play defense until i see whats happening,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,29,Winter,1901
my offer for support in moving into rum still stands,1,True,0,austria,turkey,8,30,Winter,1901
ok would you mind if i also moved my fleet to aeg,1,True,0,turkey,austria,8,31,Winter,1901

italy chose the wrong time to flip sides i was disappointed,1,True,-5,austria,turkey,8,62,Spring,1905
hi france i hope you will consider being a good neighbor and letting me of potential agression by italy since a strong italy would also not be great for you,1,True,0,austria,france,8,0,Spring,1901
ill let you know if i hear anything and i hope youll do the same if it worries you so much we could work together to nip italy in the bud,1,True,0,france,austria,8,1,Spring,1901

oh nevermind you should go for vienna,1,,1,france,austria,8,6,Fall,1902
okay now let‚Äôs talk bootshaped peninsulas you clearly kept mum to italy that i was scheming against them‚Äîof perhaps you blabbed but italy ignored you‚Äîeither way i trust you now not to betray me to them if you‚Äôd like to coconquer the place,1,True,1,france,austria,8,7,Fall,1902
im ears but my hands are a little bit tied,1,True,-2,austria,france,8,8,Spring,1903

well let‚Äôs just say now i‚Äôve got i‚Äôs attention,1,True,2,france,austria,8,12,Spring,1903
which makes it potentially an opportunity for you to move your greek fleet around though that‚Äôd still be a slight risk,1,True,2,france,austria,8,13,Spring,1903
yo italy is the worst if you disband all but vienna i‚Äôll support you into tripoli in spring,1,True,2,france,austria,8,14,Fall,1903
yeah we can try but r wont stop coming,1,True,-2,austria,france,8,15,Fall,1903

ive come back from having two armies but one is much worse,1,True,-2,austria,france,8,20,Fall,1903

you didnt split naptun,1,True,-2,austria,france,8,22,Fall,1903
you were guaranteed at least one but maybe two,1,True,-2,austria,france,8,23,Fall,1903
if you can hold on til a year from now i‚Äôll let you walk into venice   and i thought about it for sure but i guess i just really discounted the possibility that italy would seize two dots but yeah it was a mistake not to,1,True,2,france,austria,8,24,Fall,1903
ayyy italy didnt steal trieste maybe theres good in the world after all,1,True,6,france,austria,8,25,Winter,1903
anyway if you want either support into trieste or for me to cut ionian support so you can take back greece just say the word or some other assistance i havent thought of,1,True,6,france,austria,8,26,Winter,1903
do you plan to use ven this turn to push into rom,1,True,-6,austria,france,8,27,Winter,1903
if not you could attack tri and probably bounce with turkey or r,1,True,-6,austria,france,8,28,Winter,1903
i was planning to use ven for support but i‚Äôll strongly consider it,1,True,6,france,austria,8,29,Winter,1903
will it make a difference to your next move whether i commit to that or not,1,True,6,france,austria,8,30,Winter,1903
its fine if you dont we may be able to push t out in fall,1,True,-6,austria,france,8,31,Winter,1903
hm it would be nice to know if you do it or not either is fine,1,True,-6,austria,france,8,32,Winter,1903
then i‚Äôll do it but just in spring,1,True,6,france,austria,8,33,Winter,1903
ok sounds good,1,True,-6,austria,france,8,34,Spring,1904
if you dont mind my asking though what are you doing with that albanian unit if not just going for trieste this turn,1,True,6,france,austria,8,35,Spring,1904
actually looks like i is going for alb,1,True,-6,austria,france,8,36,Spring,1904
so i need to go to tri can you do your thing in i while i go to tri,1,True,-6,austria,france,8,37,Spring,1904

i expect not might keep one dot though,1,True,6,france,austria,8,41,Fall,1904
now that italy is out of the game perhaps we can work on a strategy against turkey,1,True,-6,austria,france,8,42,Fall,1904
i thought you‚Äôd never ask,1,True,6,france,austria,8,43,Fall,1904
so i think you should move trialb we can bump venice and vienna in tri,1,True,8,france,austria,8,44,Spring,1905
i cant really do that because bud pressures vie and the only reason i can keep is because of germanys support in holding,1,True,-8,austria,france,8,45,Spring,1905
so what are you gonna do then,1,True,8,france,austria,8,46,Spring,1905
ill try to attack bud with vie if you could support tri hold that would be nice,1,True,-8,austria,france,8,47,Spring,1905
you have my support for tri,1,True,8,france,austria,8,48,Fall,1905

ooh postcoffee now  so youve opened north  im focusing south  i really dont want to have to spend a lot of time and effort covering my northern dots so what can we do to keep tensions low up there,1,True,1,russia,england,8,6,Fall,1901
well im planning to build an army and im not planning to put it in norway do you want support into sweden,1,True,-2,england,russia,8,7,Winter,1901
gdii hate this app i never saw your comment so i assumed you were being silent cause you were going to shuffle barents and norway so that tap was defensive i see youre focused elsewhere so it wont be repeated,1,True,2,russia,england,8,8,Spring,1902
in fact can support to sweden if you want,1,True,2,russia,england,8,9,Fall,1902
no problem at all i would certainly appreciate that,1,,-2,england,russia,8,10,Fall,1902

bounce in black i assume  or is there anything clever youd like to try,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,8,0,Spring,1901
probably best unless youre really looking for a rat and want to rotate out but im guessing thats not the safest play,1,True,1,russia,turkey,8,1,Spring,1901
that is a nice strong southern opening,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,8,2,Fall,1901

straight to hell if i dont change my ways putting ukr into rum no move to black  you are free to rotate  the western opening irks me,1,,1,russia,turkey,8,4,Fall,1901
before and after going for trieste italy hasnt really made any any overtures to me about working together against austria  i dont like to see deceit behind every door but we may be looking at an ai  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,8,5,Fall,1901

well  you clearly enjoy puns üòä,1,,-1,turkey,russia,8,7,Fall,1901
look austria is asking me to bounce you in rumania  i dont know if thats a great idea  he also told me that hes going to make a go for galicia  so  i think he might be full of shit ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,8,8,Fall,1901
probably  he strikes me as the kind of guy who opened all of his s01 negotiations by promising to ally with everyone against a common neighbor whatev  im clearly positioned to be all over him and at least reasonably friendly with you  id like to continue down that road if you dont mind  and the way the west looks after one turn id give decent odds that ill be looking to pitch a full rt in the near future  im thinking thats probably good for you since the north looks more organized than the south üôÇ,1,True,1,russia,turkey,8,9,Fall,1901
yeah it looks like his whole change to why dont you take greece while i protect my home centers was a ruse  let me know what bul can do for you  id like a dot at some point obviously but we have a great chance to make some headway into the balkans,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,8,10,Winter,1901
eh lets just erase him  youll likely end up with the lions share of dots actually as i need to pay attention to the north but its worth it if i get less totally random negotiation and dont have to worry too much about the southern flank,1,True,2,russia,turkey,8,11,Winter,1901
i am not a dot grabbing ho  i know this is big talk for a man in the black sea but im not  how do you recommend we proceed against austria im 100 down with wiping him out with you,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,8,12,Winter,1901
meh you in the black sea doesnt bother me as much as me in the black sea would bother you,1,True,2,russia,turkey,8,13,Winter,1901
and moves depend on how aggressive you want to be and whether youre prioritizing rotating the fleet out  either way i think we try to put you in rum and me in bud,1,True,2,russia,turkey,8,14,Winter,1901
me in rum now  that sounds like a perfect arrangement especially with me helping you into budapest   austria has offered me support into rumania so maybe we can use that to our advantage,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,8,15,Winter,1901

sure black didnt really bother me  as to tactics the current support is for bul  rum but if youre willing to switch im willing to support con  rum so bull can cut serbia if youre game,1,True,2,russia,turkey,8,22,Spring,1902
that looks about right italy should back off now that frances intentions are more obvious i do indeed have to focus on the north and you should still have austrias trust as well as mine,1,True,2,russia,turkey,8,23,Spring,1902

ok let‚Äôs see what italy says he‚Äôs doing with his adriatic fleet,1,True,1,turkey,russia,8,64,Fall,1904
the real trick is going to be convincing him to keep the army in apulia instead of the fleet in trieste,1,True,-1,russia,turkey,8,65,Fall,1904

assuming serbia is the mover unless you tell me otherwise,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,8,96,Fall,1905
that‚Äôs the mover do i tap silesia does warsaw support galsil or are you not going for berlin,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,97,Fall,1905
oh i was kinda assuming youd tap bohemia and id blow up silesia but again im only half paying attention right now due to work   berlin seems unlikely but i guess not less likely than anything else,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,8,98,Fall,1905
he has to cover denmark sweden kiel and berlin,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,99,Fall,1905
let me know what gal should do üòä,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,100,Fall,1905
tap bohemia ill handle tapping silesia  m definitely diving for a german dot,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,8,101,Fall,1905
i will tap bohemia,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,102,Fall,1905
there is a chance that he forces galicia i mean it‚Äôs what i‚Äôd do thoughts  honestly i haven‚Äôt been super impressed by the tactical play of germany this game  so i‚Äôm not super worried,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,103,Fall,1905
yeah he doesnt seem very innovative tactically i can step up the pressure on that assumption,1,True,-3,russia,turkey,8,104,Spring,1906
thoughts on bohtyr,1,True,3,turkey,russia,8,105,Spring,1906
i was thinking trieste to tyr and bohmun but good either way,1,True,-3,russia,turkey,8,106,Spring,1906
i don‚Äôt want to completely rule out getting germany to our side,1,True,3,turkey,russia,8,107,Spring,1906
yeah damnit thats why i was softshoeing him so much there for a while,1,True,-3,russia,turkey,8,108,Spring,1906
too bad you went to tyr instead of boh we could have popped his army,1,True,3,turkey,russia,8,109,Spring,1906
i think i can grab venice with no problem  and i think much more recommendations,1,True,3,turkey,russia,8,110,Spring,1906
damn i shut my brain of for the weekend cause i didnt think we were going to process until monday do we want to start plucking off france yet or wait for him to finish moving on germany  i could argue it either way,1,True,-3,russia,turkey,8,111,Fall,1906
i think i take dots off of france,1,True,3,turkey,russia,8,112,Fall,1906
wanted to check in make sure you were comfortable with everything i‚Äôm going to try to get position on france and really make him have to overcommit in the south which will free you up to take german dots in the north if you can plop some fleets down we can actually take germany out and ‚Äúthree way‚Äù this with france which is not usually what a french three way means but  y‚Äôknow,1,True,3,turkey,russia,8,113,Fall,1906
lol yeah im good with all that,1,True,-3,russia,turkey,8,114,Fall,1906
they both retreated to tyrolia ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1,True,4,turkey,russia,8,115,Winter,1906
whoops and i wouldve moved from galicia instead of vienna if id realized you were emptying tyrolia fwiw  anyway berlin is forced now,1,True,-4,russia,turkey,8,116,Winter,1906
i could have given you more detail i did say i was going for position  üòä,1,True,4,turkey,russia,8,117,Winter,1906
you did and its what i would have done but like i said before last week i didnt have a whole lot of brain power left to spend on this game much better this week,1,True,-4,russia,turkey,8,118,Winter,1906
end of year can be a motherfucker,1,True,4,turkey,russia,8,119,Winter,1906
want me to fill tyrolia now  berlin roll still be forced in the fall,1,True,-4,russia,turkey,8,120,Spring,1907
i think that‚Äôs best we should roll germany now,1,True,4,turkey,russia,8,121,Spring,1907
want rum to backfill galicia,1,True,4,turkey,russia,8,122,Spring,1907
shouldnt be necessary  probably better to get to trieste,1,True,-4,russia,turkey,8,123,Spring,1907
already orders to serbia,1,True,4,turkey,russia,8,124,Spring,1907
should be very interesting to see france‚Äôs moves here he hasn‚Äôt really impressed me with his moves so far more of was super fortunate to have a null value in italy and an ineffective england,1,True,4,turkey,russia,8,125,Spring,1907
thoroughly unimpressed,1,True,4,turkey,russia,8,126,Fall,1907
all around there were a half dozen ways to stop me from developing the position sound munich now hes losing not just berlin but he needs french help to hold munich,1,True,-4,russia,turkey,8,127,Fall,1907
if france doesn‚Äôt take other german dots,1,True,4,turkey,russia,8,128,Fall,1907
germany has threatened to throw all his dots to you if i don‚Äôt attack you now     so i‚Äôm going to keep pressing against france i don‚Äôt think either of us is a solo threat so let‚Äôs get this down to three players and split that sweet sweet cash pool üí∞ üí¥,1,True,4,turkey,russia,8,129,Fall,1907
at this point im just punishing poor play üòÉ,1,True,-4,russia,turkey,8,130,Fall,1907
i agree with that sentiment,1,True,4,turkey,russia,8,131,Fall,1907
wow he did vacate all his shit,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,132,Winter,1907
ummmm do i have anything to worry about,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,133,Winter,1907
aside from knowledge that all we do is ultimately destined to be meaningless as the universe inevitably slides toward heat death  nope not even remotely three years wouldnt be enough to eliminate you even if i felt so inclined and i dont,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,8,134,Winter,1907
i tend to agree  but ive seen some pretty shitty play so far  im building fleet con  i assume youre building 3x armies just in case germany doesnt disband sil  we might need to cover his options in the event he gets into galicia,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,135,Winter,1907
you are correct in all counts,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,8,136,Spring,1908
i will be in position to cover rum and bud if you need help there  i think it would be preferable not to let him into gal in the first place of course  im rotating my army into venice and we can kick him out of piedmont if he tries to play fuckfuck games with regards to your army in tyrol,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,137,Spring,1908
im covering galicia venice or tyrolia are good covers for you,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,8,138,Spring,1908

i believed you,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,146,Fall,1908
yep but you also supported into rum just to make sure which i respect  im of course building in warsaw and dont anticipate having any units next to your dots the rest of the game piedmont can support venice to tuscany  it would be somewhat appreciated if you supported silesia to munich,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,8,147,Winter,1908
ok supporting silesia to munich and i‚Äôd prefer if you supported romtuscany,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,148,Spring,1909
wait no venice to tuscany is much better,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,149,Spring,1909
done and done,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,8,150,Spring,1909
i assume retreating to venice cause no illwill,1,True,-2,russia,turkey,8,151,Spring,1909
sure  im not super worried about it,1,True,2,turkey,russia,8,152,Spring,1909

piedmont is yours to command if you can support silesia to munich thats awesome im trying to impress on france the importance of moving to eliminate sweden,1,True,-1,russia,turkey,8,156,Spring,1910
i mean let him have denmark,1,True,1,turkey,russia,8,157,Spring,1910
silesia to munich got it,1,True,1,turkey,russia,8,158,Spring,1910
if he asks sure but skagerrak is guaranteed and ends the german,1,True,-1,russia,turkey,8,159,Spring,1910

are you going to support him into swe,1,True,1,turkey,russia,8,163,Fall,1910
germany needs to be at zero or he gets part of the draw,1,True,1,turkey,russia,8,164,Fall,1910
yes im supporting him into sweden and not tapping norway as i should because i dont trust him not to eff it up,1,True,-1,russia,turkey,8,165,Fall,1910
oh he‚Äôs an incredibly bad player,1,True,1,turkey,russia,8,166,Fall,1910
or at least hasn‚Äôt made the best moves in this game in my opinion,1,True,1,turkey,russia,8,167,Fall,1910
we‚Äôve done alright together,1,True,1,turkey,russia,8,168,Fall,1910
not too bad all things considered i do feel like i skated through the mid game when i shouldnt have survived if the middle board had been a little more tactically minded,1,True,-1,russia,turkey,8,169,Fall,1910
i was tempted to go after you and if board top meant anything in this format i probably would have,1,True,1,turkey,russia,8,170,Fall,1910
fair,1,True,-1,russia,turkey,8,171,Fall,1910
oh silesia to munich again but this time actually protecting denmark,1,True,-1,russia,turkey,8,172,Fall,1910

honestly,1,,-1,russia,turkey,8,174,Fall,1910
rome to tunis nap to rome second option would be tys to tunis blow up tuscany and still move nap to rome all of that based on if this game were to continue,1,True,-1,russia,turkey,8,175,Fall,1910
rome to tunis is the move,1,True,1,turkey,russia,8,176,Fall,1910
the game is over as soon as france i puts his moves,1,True,1,turkey,russia,8,177,Fall,1910

lol  man i made the comment to turkey that the italian would probably go ahead and dive for smy because it was lowrisk and even having to turn around and deal with you the chance of an extra unit would be helpful but i didnt think the poor bastard would actually move his army to the corner of the board out of the way given your positioning  wow  i dunno what you said to him but he really misread that position,1,True,1,russia,france,8,2,Fall,1902
haha italy must be some kinda optimist because i said nothing to them i‚Äôll be honest with you i advised turkey to try and snatch sevastopol and i had you slated to lose at least one dot how you got england to help you in the north and turkey on your side is an impressive mystery to me i‚Äôd ask if you wanted to be allies but it‚Äôs clear you have your pick,1,True,-1,france,russia,8,3,Fall,1902

hey turkeyjust a word of advice which may already be obvious to you but now would be a good time to try and snatch sevastopol with your black sea fleet supported by your rum army because russia cant defend all three of vienna warsaw and sevastopol so you have like a 13 chance of getting to take it,1,True,1,france,turkey,8,0,Fall,1902
thank you  i think i would be guaranteed to take it  speaking of taking  are you going to take italy in the rear  youre certainly gearing up for it,1,True,-1,turkey,france,8,1,Fall,1902

not sure didnt really discuss build with him,1,True,-1,turkey,france,8,24,Spring,1903
have you and austria talked at all some things italy said makes me think they may be collaborating,1,True,1,france,turkey,8,25,Spring,1903
after he took bulgaria off of me  im sure he and italy are trying to work together,1,True,-1,turkey,france,8,26,Spring,1903
well just keep ia out of the aegean and they‚Äôre no threat to the anatolian wanted to warn you though not to bank on i shifting units back west to defend the homeland because i made a deal with i to back off in exchange for tunisia,1,True,1,france,turkey,8,27,Spring,1903
are you going to actually back off,1,True,-1,turkey,france,8,28,Spring,1903
doing so allows me to devote more resources to englandgermany who are more pressing threats to me right now don‚Äôt you agree,1,True,1,france,turkey,8,29,Spring,1903
no  i think england and germany are at each others throats and if i were you i would balance that power make sure neither wins out and consolidate gains against italy  it takes naval superiority or a unit behind munich to break through into germany  you can hold a stalemate line with 2 armies which you have,1,True,-1,turkey,france,8,30,Spring,1903
also with england having two armies on the island theres no way youre taking a dot  and with only two fleets theres no way hes attacking you,1,True,-1,turkey,france,8,31,Spring,1903
do you think given this situation that italy won‚Äôt actually believe our deal is credible and will actually send a unit or two back to defend,1,True,1,france,turkey,8,32,Spring,1903
i would  but i also would have instead of just letting france into a position of power  you have an advantage press it,1,True,-1,turkey,france,8,33,Spring,1903
truth be told that was always my plan i just didn‚Äôt want to say so to you in case you turned around and told italy not to trust me but you‚Äôve made me see that that ruse is already flimsy at best,1,True,1,france,turkey,8,34,Spring,1903

not to be callous  but we receive a larger split of the prize money the fewer players make it to the draw can you maybe not make us all have to band together and preserve the smaller powers just to stop your solo threat maybe work with russia against germany and let me make some gains against italy and austria while you finish off italy and gut england it‚Äôs not a lot of money but since there‚Äôs no prize for board top we might as well maximize our gains,1,True,-2,turkey,france,8,36,Winter,1903

ok so  its 1903  the game ends in 1910  lets revisit this at the end of 1905  can we agree on that  also part of playing diplomacy is playing to the scoring system  which in this case is all surviving players have an equal share of the draw  so if youre not going to win outright winning is having the smallest draw possible  so in a way i am offering you a chance to have the best possible win  maybe,1,True,-2,turkey,france,8,38,Winter,1903

well you clearly know how to play the game  sometimes players are a little slower on the uptake when it comes to scoring systems  both lady and gentlemen players  there are far too few lady players in the hobby and i would hate to have done or said anything to turn one off from playing  i do sympathize however  ive seen the bullshit that ladies have to put up with to play board games sometimes  i usually call attention to it to ridicule the person doing it and was a little sensitive when i got accuse of doing it myself,1,True,-2,turkey,france,8,43,Winter,1903

i am willing to do that but my only hesitation is that you clearly don‚Äôt need the extra builds to go after russia they‚Äôve left most of their dots wide open to you am i missing something or is this about balancing power with me,1,True,4,france,turkey,8,63,Spring,1906
there is definitely a power balance element,1,True,-4,turkey,france,8,64,Spring,1906
but im only at 8  i need 4 fleets defending against you plus 2 armies to ensure that i hold trieste  i also have a unit on the front line with germany  that leaves literally one unit a con that is available to do anything antirussian and it literally cant reach a russian center this year  however if i get 2 builds off of italy they become two armies and wham bam im in ukr and arm and hes fucked,1,False,-4,turkey,france,8,65,Spring,1906
so i need for russia to be the only one on the line with germany and that army thats in bohemia to be in venice   your call but you can easily fall back and make a stalemate line in tunis with your fleets that i cant crack  mar s pie gol s tus wes s tyr tun s tyr tus h tyr h    however even with this youre still a threat to solo  i would need to get munich or stp otherwise youve got a path to a solo   so yeah we need to balance of power this  maybe you also vacate tunis to take the solo off the table  i know that you want to get a solo victory so i understand if you decide that this isnt the path you want to take  but if youre genuine about you and me twowaying this thing  ive laid out the path,1,False,-4,turkey,france,8,66,Spring,1906
in principle i‚Äôm not against our balancing power nor am i fixated on soloing but hear me out on this unless i go barrelling into tyrolia‚Äîwhich i won‚Äôt and you‚Äôd have at least two turns of warning if i did‚Äîyou only need trieste to hold trieste if you build an army in smyrna on the pretense of convoying it somewhere then you can walk into sevastopol next year as an initial stab you will almost certainly be able to take vienna with bohemia and trieste followed by budapest with help from albania having moved to serbia that‚Äôs russia down to two dots and you up to 11 with nary a cession from me meanwhile germany would be fending me off so you‚Äôd not have to worry about german attacks on oldaustria  i‚Äôm still pretty inexperienced at this game so if there‚Äôs some obvious issue here i‚Äôm not seeing just tell me but surely you can understand my hesitance to give up so much without first seeing any proof of loyalty from you,1,True,4,france,turkey,8,67,Spring,1906
thank you for the honest response  so im more experienced than you  didnt say better player  and ive seen a lot of games  youre at 12 and the 6 you need for a solo you have relatively easily if we dont work together on the other side of the board  edi hol and  with the fleets you have available  den swe nor and stp   thats assuming no gains in mainland germany  so this means that germany and russia are going to need to work together in the north to stop you  which im willing to allow unless you let me take the italian dots    also ive already built a con  were in spring moves,1,True,-4,turkey,france,8,68,Spring,1906
wow that was a short winter but with all three italian dots plus bud ven sev all attainable by you in two years if i hand over italy all you‚Äôll need to solo is the remains of russia and one other dot and italy isn‚Äôt exactly splittable not with you and me so flush with fleets  how about this we illustrate our commitment this spring by each overtly stabbing our allies and making no moves against each other or into the ionian then in fall i‚Äôll let you into venice and start moseying out of italy and shift my focus northward so you‚Äôd be pretty much guaranteed three dots this year and the remaining two italian dots next year meanwhile i‚Äôll be doing what i can to break even,1,True,4,france,turkey,8,69,Spring,1906

as a reminder were being compensated to participate in a game where our language is being evaluated for honestydishonesty  its pretty shitty that youve gone radio silent and pretty disrespectful to the organizer of the game   im going to easily take naples and might be able to grab tunis when its all said and done  but thats as far as i can go  why dont you just walk away build a defensible line and focus on grabbing those 34 supply centers in the north,1,True,-2,turkey,france,8,97,Spring,1908
which as i recall has been my pitch to you the past two weeks,1,True,-2,turkey,france,8,98,Spring,1908

you have demonstrated remarkably thin skin this game  success in diplomacy relies on adjusting to the conditions of the current game state reading the board making reasonable requests based on the game state not reading into other peoples responses what you want to see versus what they probably mean etc  i opened with pitching for a 3way split from the get go  literally in 1902 or 1903 and we said lets revisit it in 1907  youre the one who said that they wanted a solo and then you get upset when i say ok when you ask me to do something that would give you the best chances of attaining it  gtfoh    i guess you can call that gaslighting  i call it applying years of experience and calling a spade a spade  moving on which is all ive been trying to do you need  at most  one more fleet in the south beyond your mar tys and tun  which i assume will be your fleet in lvp headed south  that leaves your remaining seven units didnt include the a pie  to hold russia in check and take scandinavia  id be willing to not put any additional pressure on you in the south if that makes you feel more comfortable but  in all honesty  your solo chance is done  lets play for the best possible result moving forward and thats a threeway with no remaining germany,1,True,-2,turkey,france,8,100,Spring,1908
you‚Äôre right that i should have read the board rather than reading what i wanted to into your response that was a valuable lesson for me here‚Äôs one for you you don‚Äôt always get what you want i don‚Äôt care about an extra five dollars so it makes no difference to me whether a stray power is left on the board‚Äîthat‚Äôs your obsession but frankly the more i hear from you the more i get the sense that you‚Äôre accustomed to controlling things and that makes the idea of inconveniencing you all the more appealing another skill involved in this game is well diplomacy and perspective taking‚Äîyou found a thinskinned player who is less serious about the game than you are and rather than adjust your communication tactics accordingly you‚Äôve succeeded in repeatedly pissing her off,1,True,2,france,turkey,8,101,Spring,1908
how about you play for your best result,1,True,-2,turkey,france,8,102,Spring,1908
jeeze it‚Äôs like talking to a wall i keep telling you for me that means not rewarding asshole behavior,1,True,2,france,turkey,8,103,Spring,1908
i havent been an asshole  youre the one accusing me of lying and then trying to gaslight you  and acting as if my lying to you is somehow justifiable provocation for you to give both you and yourself an inferior result when the point of this exercise is to see how people tell the truth or lie when trying to achieve an optimal result,1,False,-2,turkey,france,8,104,Spring,1908
youre treating this as if its some facetoface tourney game and i just called you a lying b or this is an online game on webdip and i just called you  something nasty in the forum  ive been respectful to you obviously our 2dimensional backandforth has not resulted in a lot of  productive dialogue but there arent too many scenarios where turkey and france work together long term  youve continually taken things ive written as personal attacks and obsessed on ok as some sort of longterm alliance that i stabbed you over,1,False,-2,turkey,france,8,105,Spring,1908
also germany threw his dots to russia because he was pissed off at you  clearly things worked out swimmingly between you and england and italy im sure was your best friend there at the end of the game  i on the other hand have had a gamelong and productive partnership with my ally  maybe in all of this im not the asshole  maybe you take a long look in the mirror and if being a good neighbor and telling the truth is how you judge assholeness in your book consider what your neighbors had to say about you as they exited this game instead of the guy who said we can two way if you give me italy and you said no attack russia and well split the dots and i replied with ok,1,True,-2,turkey,france,8,106,Spring,1908
what it looks like to me is you were planning on getting a solo in this game and things didnt work out the way you wanted them to  instead of accepting this and going for your optimal result you decided to get emotional and are now lashing out at the one person whos actually trying to engage you in dialogue and work out mutually beneficial results  and youre calling me names,1,True,-2,turkey,france,8,107,Spring,1908
unless we‚Äôre speaking very different dialects of english ‚Äúok‚Äù means ‚Äúyes‚Äù no more and no less i acted in accordance with an agreement i thought we had made when i otherwise would have done more to defend against you for you to act as if that doesn‚Äôt constitute a betrayal is ludicrous to me  i‚Äôm not saying i play this game like a patron saint i lie and backstab just like anyone the difference between you and me besides our skill and experience level is that when i betray someone i don‚Äôt turn around and act as if i haven‚Äôt to me that reeks of disrespect and makes me sick way more than getting called a name,1,True,2,france,turkey,8,108,Spring,1908
im generally an honest guy and genuinely interested in working with people to achieve mutually beneficial results  what im not good at and clearly i need to improve on is working with people who are thinskinned  after my first goaround at this and i was put into a game of redditors who stopped talking to each other after 1902 i was told that i was being put into a pool of experienced players  i assumed from the getgo that you were actually an experienced player who was trying to make it sound like you werent,1,False,-2,turkey,france,8,109,Spring,1908
there might actually be a dialect issue  a filler word is an apparently meaningless word phrase or sound that marks a pause or hesitation in speech also known as a pause filler or hesitation form some of the common filler words in english are um uh er ah like okay right and you know  i type like i talk and i often use ok as a bridge or delaying word after someone has spoken and i then respond,1,False,-2,turkey,france,8,110,Spring,1908
so thats actually good feedback  i will refrain from using ok when responding in this and other online forums  i honestly didnt think i had agreed to your suggestion and got defensive when you accused me of lying  im not suggesting that i pointedly said no or didnt let you think that i was considering it but i didnt really consider myself as having agreed to it  language is funny  and multiple uses of turns of phrases can take things in different directions  and weve gone down a deep dark path that i dont think either of us are really enjoying,1,False,-2,turkey,france,8,111,Spring,1908
anyway id really like to move forward and spend the next few weeks pursuing the optimal result for both of us  and after i take naples what would you like to see  no fleets pushed up into tuscany and piedmont  i can do that if it makes you feel more comfortable  i think if you made a mistake or two or guessed wrong in 1910 i might be able to steal tunis  but i find it incredibly unlikely  so ill hold the line here if thats ok with you,1,,-2,turkey,france,8,112,Spring,1908
i don‚Äôt really believe your spiel about the use of ‚Äúok‚Äù but i do appreciate you actually acknowledging the issue instead of pretending it didn‚Äôt exist thank you   but frankly what better thing do you have to do with your units right now than defend or mount an offensive against me if you‚Äôre not going to turn on russia you have quite successfully hemmed yourself in  i can‚Äôt really even divert more resources to the north since as you acknowledge i need those fleets for a defensive line in the med so it‚Äôs not as if detenting with you would allow me to divert more units toward eliminating germany why is this so important to you the only consequence i can see is plus or minus three italian dots,1,True,2,france,turkey,8,113,Spring,1908
because i‚Äôm still committed to obtaining our optimal results so i‚Äôm asking what it would take for you not to overcommit to the south,1,,-2,turkey,france,8,114,Spring,1908

it looks to me like between me and russia germany‚Äôs northern holdings are pretty much toast even if i do at least try to take back my boot esp if there‚Äôs any chance russia would collaborate with me up there  does it matter how many dots each winning player personally has in a multiway draw if it‚Äôs already established that you me and russia are the winners with no strays what harm is there in you and me duking it out just to keep the game interesting,1,True,2,france,turkey,8,116,Spring,1908
what i wasam trying to avoid is a scenario in which you a work with germany and b send way more strength to the med than you can actually use  i was concerned since i had continually offended you that you were going to go fullon spite against me  since it would appear that youre not going to do that ok  as iron sharpens iron i will fight you in the med over the remaining dots  perhaps well both learn something  and while i was genuinely willing to hold what i currently have i will tell you the truth that i am going to continue the attack,1,True,-2,turkey,france,8,117,Spring,1908

yeah that makes sense i feel like france both him and england have reached out i think it‚Äôs kind of a three way diplomatic stalemate for the moment,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,14,Fall,1901
anything you have heard about my side,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,15,Fall,1901
no to be honest  my communication with austria and turkey has been minimal i am down to try to chat them up if i can be helpful to you,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,16,Fall,1901
not sure how much luck you would have you‚Äôre welcome to try though austria has not been talkative at all,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,17,Fall,1901
yeah we‚Äôve barely spoken well i‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre responsive i am so so so much more likely to help and ally with talkative players than players who kinda ghost,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,18,Fall,1901
i know right despite that i‚Äôm trying to ally with austria fighting them doesn‚Äôt usually end up well for me when i play as italy,0,True,0,italy,germany,9,19,Fall,1901
yeah that‚Äôs fair i was germany in my last game never fought with italy once we had a pretty good relationship and i ended up allying with them in the late game,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,20,Fall,1901
always nice to have the option i have no clue who i hope to ally with so far,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,21,Fall,1901
yeah same,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,22,Fall,1901
oh dear,1,True,1,germany,italy,9,23,Winter,1901
what‚Äôs wrong was england not supposed to do that,1,True,-1,italy,germany,9,24,Winter,1901
no sir lol,1,True,1,germany,italy,9,25,Winter,1901
what is your relationship with france like,1,True,1,germany,italy,9,26,Winter,1901
well it was supposed to be good but they just moved their fleet to the sc of spain which seems unnecessary,1,True,-1,italy,germany,9,27,Winter,1901
why,1,True,-1,italy,germany,9,28,Winter,1901
also what are your thoughts on russia,1,True,-1,italy,germany,9,29,Winter,1901
mostly just curiousity,1,True,1,germany,italy,9,30,Winter,1901
seems like a good dude,1,True,1,germany,italy,9,31,Winter,1901
i‚Äôm pretty sure france and england are gonna go for you i mentioned to him that he could help you out in the north as that would benefit me i like you and don‚Äôt want france getting too big,1,True,-1,italy,germany,9,32,Winter,1901
did he say anything,1,True,-1,italy,germany,9,33,Winter,1901
what have your conversations with france been like do you think france is allied with england,1,True,1,germany,italy,9,34,Spring,1902
yes i do i am negotiating him getting that fleet out of spain and he said he has to clear it with england,1,True,-1,italy,germany,9,35,Spring,1902
yikes,1,True,1,germany,italy,9,36,Spring,1902
yeah so you‚Äôre in trouble have you heard from russia or austria,1,,-1,italy,germany,9,37,Spring,1902
yeah been talking to russia austria only a little,1,True,1,germany,italy,9,38,Spring,1902
is russia gonna help or nah,1,True,-1,italy,germany,9,39,Spring,1902
we‚Äôll see,1,True,1,germany,italy,9,40,Fall,1902
hey italy how‚Äôs it going,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,41,Winter,1902
some good some bad as i think you can see austria was being uncooperative so it was nice to coordinate a little hit on them unfortunately france got a little bold,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,42,Winter,1902
yes that is unfortunate it seems to me that france and england are in lock step,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,43,Winter,1902
i wanted to ask what your plans for that army in tyr are,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,44,Winter,1902
well with the french being aggressive i might have to support ven holding after i build otherwise it‚Äôll probably be attacking austria,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,45,Winter,1902
is france asking you about attacking england he told me he would and i was curious whether or not he‚Äôs being honest,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,46,Spring,1903
yes he asked me,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,47,Spring,1903
can i trust him,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,48,Spring,1903
he has been extremely untrustworthy this game i would recommend trying to work with him but protect yourself as much as you can don‚Äôt trust him in any places where it makes you vulnerable,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,49,Spring,1903
but negotiating peacean attack on england can‚Äôt hurt,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,50,Spring,1903
not saying to betray him at all he has been a fantastic ally that i would love to end the game with but we should keep an eye on russia‚Äôs growth,1,,0,italy,germany,9,51,Winter,1903
yeah i‚Äôm totally with you russia says he wants a three way victory with me you and him i think the best thing we can do is build to parity,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,52,Winter,1903
exactly france is gonna try and get us to break off i‚Äôm good staying with russia for now though,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,53,Winter,1903
agreed,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,54,Winter,1903
if he helps me with turkey and austria and actually gives me supply centers then i will have enough that he can‚Äôt really stab both of us which is the point he made if he‚Äôs gonna go for a solo we will know this year,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,55,Winter,1903
i think our best bet is to ride this out take russia at his word but be prepared to work together if he turns on one of us,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,56,Winter,1903
sounds great,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,57,Winter,1903
lol,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,58,Winter,1903
is france trying to recruit you,1,,0,italy,germany,9,59,Winter,1903
yes he said ‚Äúwe need to do something about russia‚Äù,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,60,Winter,1903
yeah i‚Äôm playing along with him right now i‚Äôm supposed to be convincing you that france is trustworthy,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,61,Winter,1903
lolololololol,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,62,Winter,1903
he hasn‚Äôt even convinced me that he‚Äôs trustworthy so i don‚Äôt know why he thinks i would do that üòÇ,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,63,Winter,1903
yeah he‚Äôs a real champ,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,64,Winter,1903
he‚Äôs been so annoying all game,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,65,Winter,1903
and he wants me to ally with austria and turkey who have both already stabbed me this game,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,66,Winter,1903
yes just as france has also support england in stabbing me,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,67,Winter,1903
he knows he‚Äôs kinda beat with russia‚Äôs support france will be worn down over the next few years,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,68,Winter,1903
yeah he picked a bad ally and then that ally quit i‚Äôll be turning to crush him once we deal with the east,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,69,Winter,1903
amen i‚Äôm hoping to take many of his supply centers to establish some parity i think the best thing we can do to keep the alliance strong is make sure we‚Äôre all about the same size,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,70,Winter,1903
yeah that was the only reason i got a little worried is because he‚Äôs now doubled us,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,71,Winter,1903
hey italy good looks looks like england austria and turkey are virtually toast,1,,0,germany,italy,9,72,Fall,1904
hey italy wanted to check in and say hi things seem to being going really well for our alliance,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,73,Spring,1905
yeah i agree i still wanna make sure that france doesn‚Äôt become a threat russia is playing nice,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,74,Spring,1905
russia is been good to me i‚Äôm still weary of a stab,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,75,Spring,1905
how‚Äôs it going italy wanted to check in,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,76,Fall,1905
pretty good i‚Äôll be heading toward france here,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,77,Fall,1905
epic let‚Äôs carve them up,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,78,Fall,1905
how are you feeling about russia,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,79,Fall,1905
good he‚Äôs been nice to me and has continued to support me,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,80,Fall,1905
yeah i still trust him and feel good about the alliance,1,True,0,germany,italy,9,81,Fall,1905
me too,1,True,0,italy,germany,9,82,Fall,1905
i think when turkey is officially eliminated we be able to get france to surrender,1,True,2,italy,germany,9,83,Fall,1906
yeah he‚Äôs just starting to break,1,True,-2,germany,italy,9,84,Fall,1906
and happy new year cheers to the russiagermanyitaly alliance,1,True,-2,germany,italy,9,85,Fall,1906
happy new year,1,True,2,italy,germany,9,86,Fall,1906
i will support pic to bre and set my win condition to three way win,1,True,4,italy,germany,9,87,Fall,1907
sounds great italy thanks for being such a great ally,1,True,-4,germany,italy,9,88,Fall,1907
you as well good game,1,,4,italy,germany,9,89,Fall,1907
hi there i know you will not be inclined to trust me but i am not a fan of attacking austria immediately as italy as such i hope we can work together i‚Äôll be playing pretty safe until i have a grasp of the board have you heard from anyone yet,1,True,0,italy,austria,9,0,Spring,1901
hello italy  i would be fine with being friendly  how would you suggest we prove said friendliness to each other  i am on the late side of messaging so i have received a few messages,1,True,0,austria,italy,9,1,Spring,1901
i will hold ven i‚Äôm assuming you would hold tri if you trust me enough to move out of tri then i‚Äôd move out of ven when i see it in the fall but that takes trust on your part,1,,0,italy,austria,9,2,Spring,1901
what have you heard from russia and turkey,1,True,0,italy,austria,9,3,Spring,1901
not much from russia  i am currently speaking with turkey,1,True,0,austria,italy,9,4,Spring,1901
let me know how those go are you negotiating the balkans,1,,0,italy,austria,9,5,Spring,1901
trying to figure out how to deal with all of that yes,1,True,0,austria,italy,9,6,Spring,1901
if we are to be at peace i would suggest tyr remains a neutral territory between the two of us  if you move there i will assume you do not have the friendliest of intents,1,True,0,austria,italy,9,7,Spring,1901
that sounds great to me agreed,1,True,0,italy,austria,9,8,Spring,1901
agreed,1,True,0,austria,italy,9,9,Spring,1901
has there been any discussion over gre,1,True,0,italy,austria,9,10,Fall,1901
we havent i am planning to take greece you should take tunis  any thoughts on next season and how we can work together,1,True,0,austria,italy,9,11,Fall,1901
not yet are you and russia on good enough terms that you feel comfortable,1,True,0,italy,austria,9,12,Fall,1901
so far  we kept gal neutral which is as we discussed  so so far seems fine,1,True,0,austria,italy,9,13,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm fine with holding our armies at ven and tri as long as you want since i‚Äôm more sea based however i feel like you will want to move out of there at some point do you want to try and resolve that,1,True,0,italy,austria,9,14,Fall,1901
i am open to your ideas  if we sit forever we are just wasting a units movement,1,True,0,austria,italy,9,15,Fall,1901
i need my build this season so vacating ven and trusting you to not take it is too big of a risk for me right now you could stab me without any consequence to yourself so i have to view me having ven as a protection against that you may have a different opinion but i don‚Äôt see you as being in the same boat even if you vacate tri and i take it which i won‚Äôt you would still get a build and i would end up being stuck fighting you without much momentum so i propose that you move out of tri first and when i see that you can‚Äôt take ven then i will move out of ven,1,True,0,italy,austria,9,16,Fall,1901
i realize this is a risk for you so if you have a counter plan or just don‚Äôt like the idea i understand,1,True,0,italy,austria,9,17,Fall,1901
i will think on this  regardless i will not attack ven,1,True,0,austria,italy,9,18,Fall,1901
and i will not attack tri,1,True,0,italy,austria,9,19,Fall,1901
i appreciate the trust however we will be stuck in the same position assuming you build back into tri,1,,-1,italy,austria,9,20,Winter,1901
would you like to coordinate an attack on turkey for this year,1,True,-1,italy,austria,9,21,Spring,1902
i am open to your ideas though i would prefer trying to find a way to work against france though i need to think of ideas on that  let me know what your idea is and we can go from there meanwhile i will also try to think of ideas,1,True,1,austria,italy,9,22,Spring,1902
russia is planning on supporting germany against france and england if you did so as well that would slow them down you could use your two balkan units to help us against turkey we could get you bul and help you keep it i have some ideas for move combinations if you agree,1,True,-1,italy,austria,9,23,Spring,1902
what makes you worried about france,1,True,-1,italy,austria,9,24,Spring,1902
well neither france nor england went into the english channel  that leads me to believe they are working together  so if that is correct there are only 2 directions for france to go  through germany  or south through you,1,True,1,austria,italy,9,25,Spring,1902
gotcha would you be interested in coordinating an attack on turkey,1,True,-1,italy,austria,9,26,Spring,1902
what do you suggest  also what did you think about what i said about france,1,True,1,austria,italy,9,27,Spring,1902
,1,True,1,austria,italy,9,28,Spring,1902
france has messaged me to tell me that there is tension that he think he has diffused with you  i have played this game enough to not believe him as i said why would he leave you alone  his placement seems certain that he is friendly with england  i guess we will see after spring but i would be careful there,1,True,1,austria,italy,9,29,Spring,1902
yeah france and i are in negotiations that i hope are genuine but i will be playing cautious  i do not trust france at all and if what they told me is true then england is wearing the pants in their alliance,1,,-1,italy,austria,9,30,Spring,1902
russia has a solid plan to hurt turkey it‚Äôs gonna take some trust on your part though we need you to hold off on taking bul if you feel like you need to take it though then go for it,1,True,-1,italy,austria,9,31,Spring,1902
it looks like turkey and russia are allied,1,True,-1,italy,austria,9,32,Fall,1902
to the detriment of turkey they didnt want to listen and they put themselves in such a bad space  i think the person playing turkey does not understand this game  i gave them a solid plan and instead they gave up the black sea o well,1,True,1,austria,italy,9,33,Fall,1902
how do you want to handle the situation,1,True,-1,italy,austria,9,34,Fall,1902
im not sure  meanwhile i warned you about france and he has moved his fleet into gold of lyo what do you think he is doing with that fleet it cant be to help you,1,True,1,austria,italy,9,35,Fall,1902
ug this is a mess now in the south,1,True,1,austria,italy,9,36,Fall,1902
do you want me to support your fleet into the agean,1,True,1,austria,italy,9,37,Fall,1902
also if i were you you should send your army in tunis up to tuscany  he will probably try to take pie this turn,1,True,1,austria,italy,9,38,Fall,1902
yeah that support would be good,0,,-1,italy,austria,9,39,Fall,1902
also france and i agreed to that move because we were in negotiations now negotiating him out,1,True,-1,italy,austria,9,40,Fall,1902
you might be able to get a free sc at warsaw i guess you could just overpower rum too he doesn‚Äôt have much to defend against you,1,True,-1,italy,austria,9,41,Fall,1902
i hope you are right with france  i will support your fleet into aeg should you chose to go there,1,True,1,austria,italy,9,42,Fall,1902
i‚Äôd be willing to negotiate a cease fire,0,,1,italy,austria,9,43,Winter,1902
hi there as probably the weakest nation i have always felt that italy can benefit from having russia as a friend and that it can be mutually beneficial do you have any initial thoughts going into the game,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,0,Spring,1901
i fully agree russias well served by a friend in italy as well im primarily concerned with which proverbial horse im going to back in the inevitable austria vs turkey rumble what do you think,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,1,Spring,1901
i‚Äôd personally favor austria,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,2,Spring,1901
for now i tend to agree austria can become a thorn later on but turkeys an immediate threat,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,3,Spring,1901
sounds good hopefully austria and i can reach an agreement you vouching for me and not hitting gal would help,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,4,Spring,1901
ive reached out to them but theyre yet to respond ill tell them about it as soon as i get a response,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,5,Spring,1901
yeah i havnt heard back yet either,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,6,Spring,1901
have you talked to turkey yet,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,7,Spring,1901
i have yes weve essentially agreed to bounce in the black sea and weve talked about fighting the austrians still no word from the austrians on my end about possibly fighting the turks,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,8,Spring,1901
what about rum i‚Äôm trying to figure out if i can snag gre i doubt i can if you‚Äôre getting rum though,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,9,Spring,1901
im going to be moving into rum on the second turn with the army from warsaw,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,10,Spring,1901
got it,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,11,Spring,1901
so youll likely be doing a lepanto right assuming that the austrians ever speak to you of course,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,12,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm not really sure lepanto‚Äôs are kind of risky plus turkey thinks i‚Äôm going to which makes it pretty ineffective and yeah i need to hear from austria what do you think the odds of me being able to land gre are,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,13,Spring,1901
with austrian support the turks wouldnt be able to stop you but it all really depends on them if you get the turks to think youll be on their side you might be able to get them to support your landing but thats a longshot,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,14,Spring,1901
because getting to 5 would be nice i would actually have some options but yeah we need contact from austria,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,15,Spring,1901
yeah the more time goes on the more im thinking of playing along with the turks for at least long enough to dismantle them but i really really dont want to do that,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,16,Spring,1901
yeah hopefully we hear from austria soon just so that there are options for everyone including turkey,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,17,Spring,1901
yeah them being afk really forces a scramble for their territory,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,18,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm guessing they aren‚Äôt actually afk and have just not gotten on the discord yet although this is strange,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,19,Spring,1901
if they do end up going afk i would have to assume we would restart the game,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,20,Spring,1901
i certainly hope so the games never as interesting with one nation doa,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,21,Spring,1901
any news on austria,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,22,Spring,1901
they just responded to my message no big breakthrough but at least theyre alive,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,23,Spring,1901
yeah same gonna work on staying peaceful,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,24,Spring,1901
we agreed to leave galicia empty but the way they worded it makes me feel kinda onedge about it hopefully they dont do anything thatll derail everything,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,25,Spring,1901
we‚Äôre leaving tyr open he must be planning on going after turkey then,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,26,Spring,1901
regardless even if he does try something funny ill be in a position to counter it hopefully its as you said,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,27,Spring,1901
i will be too not leaving ven until he isn‚Äôt an immediate threat,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,28,Spring,1901
solid choice no reason to move it unless the french start getting funny ideas,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,29,Spring,1901
which i doubt that attack never works,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,30,Spring,1901
yeah it always leaves them too open to attack by the other two members of the western triple,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,31,Spring,1901
turkey is responding to austria but hasn‚Äôt responded to me something to keep an eye on,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,32,Spring,1901
well if the austrians were willing to tell you that then its a good sign about whether or not weve got the austrians on our side at the very least then again if theyre talking to each other its bad news for me,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,33,Spring,1901
if they both went after you i‚Äôd probably intervene,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,34,Spring,1901
it would be too good of an opportunity,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,35,Spring,1901
thered be plenty of openings for you to exploit thats for sure lol,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,36,Spring,1901
exactly,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,37,Spring,1901
god germany had me so goddamn worried about getting bounced in sweden and they didnt even twitch toward denmark this turn ffs,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,38,Fall,1901
better than a potential bounce i might try to find out what the alliance situation is in the western theatre it looks like turkey might be scared of a lepanto with his hold,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,39,Fall,1901
he is im communicating with him consistently keeping him unaware that im not on his side hes going to move to armenia to build a fleet in smyrna and hes going to pivot the ankara fleet to constantinople so that it can leave,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,40,Fall,1901
thank you for the information i suppose i‚Äôll be needing to propose an attack on them with austria then,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,41,Fall,1901
any word on if the austrians are letting you have greece,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,42,Fall,1901
i‚Äôll ask right now,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,43,Fall,1901
are you getting much from austria they don‚Äôt seem very chatty,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,44,Fall,1901
austria is gonna take gre,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,45,Fall,1901
well that sucks not much to be done about it though,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,46,Fall,1901
and yeah  i havent gotten much from austria at all just a single volley of messages that one time in the first season,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,47,Fall,1901
i just heard back from them again they still trust you regarding gal,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,48,Fall,1901
very good though at this point they kinda have to,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,49,Fall,1901
so what are your thoughts on turkey they will have 4 units after this year and possibly be in bla,1,True,-1,italy,russia,9,50,Fall,1901
as long as the three of us you me and to a lesser degree austria stay together we can take them easily no matter how good their positioning,1,True,1,russia,italy,9,51,Fall,1901
do you want to start moving after this season then,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,52,Winter,1901
yes ill be making a move on them in the first season of the new year,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,53,Winter,1901
we can try to coordinate with austria but it‚Äôll probably be hard,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,54,Winter,1901
im communicating with them as much as i can,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,55,Winter,1901
it might be better to leave them out of it not sure if we can trust them,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,56,Winter,1901
yeah the move to vienna definitely indicates that they intend to build a fleet,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,57,Winter,1901
yeah we have an arrangement where he moves out of tri and i would move out of ven when i saw that however he‚Äôs gonna build right back into tri so that‚Äôs a problem,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,58,Winter,1901
what are your thoughts on germany,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,59,Winter,1901
well they seem like theyre about to have a hard time if france and britain are combined against them which it seems they are,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,60,Winter,1901
i was thinking about trying to become friendly with them since france is not looking that friendly right now speaking of do you think that i should be worried about that fleet going to the south coast of spain plus they will be building in mar,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,61,Winter,1901
you probably should ive currently got a working relationship with the germans but im thinking of upgrading it to a fullon alliance given the francebritain alliance thats unfolding,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,62,Winter,1901
i was going to propose that you send a fleet or something over to help him against england,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,63,Winter,1901
we‚Äôre on the same page üòÇ,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,64,Winter,1901
well if you want to help out you could always start putting light pressure on them not enough to provoke a reaction before were finished with the turks but enough to keep them from being able to fullfocus the germans,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,65,Winter,1901
not sure what we get from germany on this other than that england and france don‚Äôt get too big too fast,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,66,Winter,1901
eh we keep the french and british from growing out of control while we take turkey out then once were ready we can cannibalize them i reckon,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,67,Winter,1901
i don‚Äôt know how much i can dedicate to both turkey and france though i‚Äôm assuming we will want both my fleets on turkey,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,68,Winter,1901
probably just an army to pie,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,69,Winter,1901
of course turkey needs to be destroyed asap but even a slight distraction counts,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,70,Winter,1901
the only problem being that once turkeys gone traditionally austria starts either looking west or east for their next target and were on either side of that,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,71,Winter,1901
at this point i think i‚Äôd trust you enough to say this and if i can‚Äôt then i‚Äôm probably screwed either way but i think we should look to eat turkey up toward the end of our turkey campaign or else immediately after,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,72,Winter,1901
they are not a reliable communicator and my armies need to go somewhere,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,73,Winter,1901
i was wondering how to broach that subject myself i am absolutely in support i think that we should limit austrias gain to bulgaria and once weve got turkey on the ropes turn and eliminate them as fast as possible so we can both pivot to the west,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,74,Winter,1901
that sounds good to me hopefully he is responsive enough that he is useful against turkey,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,75,Winter,1901
as for how to split the austriaturkey gains well make hows this sound you trieste smyrna serbia greece and bulgaria me constantinople ankara vienna and budapest,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,76,Winter,1901
constantinople of course so that my fleet can get out and contribute in the med,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,77,Winter,1901
that sounds great,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,78,Winter,1901
have you proposed the thing to germany i‚Äôll vouch for you unless you don‚Äôt want you and i working together to be too public,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,79,Winter,1901
id already agreed to help them by taking norway and deploying my fleets to fuck with the brits i figure that as long as we keep cooperating along those lines then thats effectively an alliance no need to be all formal about it the two of you should definitely start to closely cooperate though,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,80,Winter,1901
france made some interesting choices with that build normally building fleets in the north would be something that puts the british deeply on edge,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,81,Spring,1902
yeah i‚Äôm kinda confused glad they didn‚Äôt build a fleet in mar too,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,82,Spring,1902
i‚Äôm still gonna play cautious,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,83,Spring,1902
even so if they move precisely right they can guarantee that the german fleet in belgium doesnt survive,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,84,Spring,1902
yeah it‚Äôs not looking great for my guy germany over there he‚Äôs gonna need some help,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,85,Spring,1902
well they cant kill the fleet in belgium and keep norway at the same time but then again if the germans do as i asked they wouldnt be able to do either even if they prioritized norway germany may not have the upper hand but they still have a decent position,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,86,Spring,1902
yeah i‚Äôm gonna message england about that fleet in bre and see what he says,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,87,Spring,1902
i think he anticipates me coming for norway and thats the reason that he built a fleet in edinburgh,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,88,Spring,1902
well we will see if france moves that fleet in spain back into the mid atlantic which would confuse me things are gonna get messy,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,89,Spring,1902
maybe they figure that they can get to the british when theyre out of position and grab up the majority of the supply centers before anyone can stop them,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,90,Spring,1902
yeah i really don‚Äôt know what people are thinking over there i‚Äôve tried to get a feel for the alliances even by offering to exchange info but haven‚Äôt been able to crack them according to germany england was not supposed to do what they did fairly obvious it is possible that we have misread things though and england acted on their own france did tell me they want to stay neutral until they trust someone england sneak attacking germany could have scared france leading to the fleet build this is obviously speculative though,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,91,Spring,1902
england slipped up with their language at one point and told me that they dont trust the french to stay allied with them if they dont keep them in check,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,92,Spring,1902
just got that from england as well he says he views the fleet as aggressive and unnecessary and that france says they are still allies despite this he is angry with france though so he told me that france is planning on attacking me with that mini force,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,93,Spring,1902
excellent ill work on the french to try and drive that wedge deeper,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,94,Spring,1902
should i hold off on messaging france wouldn‚Äôt be the worst thing to make them think i‚Äôm oblivious,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,95,Spring,1902
they started playing their cards very close to their chest with me though so i dont know if they trust me anymore if you can get them off guard as far as your skill goes i can definitely see that going to your advantage,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,96,Spring,1902
i definitely dont like that the austrians decided to build a fleet in trieste that doesnt indicate trust worthiness,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,97,Spring,1902
any chance at least one of your armies will be heading down to keep austria honest,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,98,Spring,1902
i wish that i had the armies to spare but with the brits displaying some amount of suspicion i dont know if i can afford to have any fewer than 3 units up there,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,99,Spring,1902
hey weird pitch are you alright if i let slip to the french that the brits might have given away some of their plans regarding you it has a lot of potential to drive a wedge into that alliance,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,100,Spring,1902
yeah that‚Äôs fine with me i‚Äôd like to keep france away from me i‚Äôm kind of worried about france and austria teaming up on me there wouldn‚Äôt be much i can do,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,101,Spring,1902
hopefully the revelation that their plans have been revealed will keep them off your back,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,102,Spring,1902
that sounds great i messaged austria about going after turkey he said that he is interested but is more worried about france that is reassuring to me though maybe you could reach out and try to figure out how we could do both,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,103,Spring,1902
theres not much i can do about france without dealing with the british first but the best thing that we could do for the time being is see to it that the turks are eliminated  on that note im working a deep subterfuge with the turks this turn im going to support them to hold in bulgaria while my fleet moves with their consent no less into the black sea in fall i plan to convoy my army from rumania to constantinople from there we can annihilate them completely hopefully within the third year,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,104,Spring,1902
that sounds great by the way you have successfully pissed off france he sent me a long message about how i will not be attacked and that i should trust him,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,105,Spring,1902
excellent driving that wedge deeper as we speak need them to decide that im a better partner than the british,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,106,Spring,1902
sounds great i‚Äôm still not sure about france so keep working on france to convince them not to attack me either,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,107,Spring,1902
test message i‚Äôm not getting the thumb option,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,108,Spring,1902
weird wasn‚Äôt working when i messaged england,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,109,Spring,1902
yeah it messes up from time to time the french have assured me emphatically that they never had any plans to attack you to begin with and have indicated a temptation to make a rush at liverpool if i advance the front in scandinavia,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,110,Spring,1902
interesting does not seem like a solid alliance we are working on demilitarizing the mediterranean so that i i don‚Äôt have to be worried,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,111,Spring,1902
im going to keep up the temptations but i think that ive pushed hard enough at them for this season at least,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,112,Spring,1902
hopefully i can trust france after this,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,113,Spring,1902
one can certainly hope in any case youll be in decent position to counter them if they make a move toward you,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,114,Spring,1902
yeah unless austria does too but i doubt that,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,115,Spring,1902
austria seems earnest at the very least but the glut of units they have that have to sit sedentary certainly puts me on edge,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,116,Spring,1902
yeah i was hoping to coordinate an attack with them but i don‚Äôt know now,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,117,Spring,1902
destroying turkey would be faster if they took bulgaria in fall but i dont want to give them another build that has to sit around doing nothing,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,118,Spring,1902
i was thinking about going ion  aeg and nap  ion i would go into eas but i have a feeling turkey will move there do you have any idea what their moves are from your spying,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,119,Spring,1902
yeah if they don‚Äôt take it it isn‚Äôt the end of the world,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,120,Spring,1902
i desperately need the turkish move into the aegean to not bounce so that i can convoy an army to constantinople i believe that they intend to move both fleets out at the same time but i know for fact that they want to move into the aegean with the fleet in constantinople at the very least id recommend bouncing the eastern med and moving the fleet in naples out to the tyrrhenian sea so that if the french do move toward you youre in better position to stop it,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,121,Spring,1902
sorry i had intended to make move recommendations and tell you what turkeys plan was at the point where i told you that i was going to move an army to constantinople but apparently i completely failed to do that,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,122,Spring,1902
okay that‚Äôs fine as long as things will work,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,123,Spring,1902
unless the turks catch on it should work like a charm,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,124,Spring,1902
sounds great i may not move into the tyrr just because of an agreement i made with france,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,125,Spring,1902
fair im just concerned that the agreement was only so that you wouldnt move while they put themselves into position,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,126,Spring,1902
yeah i‚Äôll keep an eye on it,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,127,Spring,1902
the austrians are expressing doubt about my plan im concerned that they think im proposing something thatll get them doublecrossed theyre impatient for bulgaria,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,128,Spring,1902
that‚Äôs understandable i‚Äôll see what they say to me,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,129,Spring,1902
im mostly worried that theyll act alone or worse make a move on me,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,130,Spring,1902
i don‚Äôt think so they‚Äôre a lot more worried about this france thing for some reason,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,131,Spring,1902
i cant imagine why theres an entire switzerland between the two of them,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,132,Spring,1902
i know i don‚Äôt get it,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,133,Spring,1902
austrias gone rogue,1,,2,russia,italy,9,134,Fall,1902
goddamnit theyre going to ruin the entire offensive,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,135,Fall,1902
standby for possible drastic shift in allegiances,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,136,Fall,1902
yeah austria is dumb,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,137,Fall,1902
how do you feel about shifting our plans to attack the austrians instead,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,138,Fall,1902
i was going to ask you the same thing,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,139,Fall,1902
you should start communicating with them ive gotten them to agree to let you have greece you should talk to them about convoying there,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,140,Fall,1902
as in talk to turkey,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,141,Fall,1902
right yeah if you hadnt started already i mean,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,142,Fall,1902
will do i have to figure out my france thing too,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,143,Fall,1902
yeah its not looking very much like a dmz over there,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,144,Fall,1902
we both agreed to move into those because we weren‚Äôt sure what to do yet,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,145,Fall,1902
sounds like the french are trying to maneuver themselves into some kind of position while feigning indecision,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,146,Fall,1902
yeah i‚Äôm having him move out before i do,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,147,Fall,1902
good idea,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,148,Fall,1902
it‚Äôd be good for me to get a build here though so that i can support myself,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,149,Fall,1902
do you think it‚Äôs too risky to go ven  tyr,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,150,Fall,1902
nah if you can take the austrians by surprise and nab two supply centers at once so much the better especially since you could immediately build in venice after that,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,151,Fall,1902
tyr isn‚Äôt a supply center,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,152,Fall,1902
thhhbt got it mixed up with trieste in my head still if you succeed to take greece itd be a hugely powerful play,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,153,Fall,1902
plus he hasn‚Äôt attack ven all game,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,154,Fall,1902
hopefully he doesnt take you for a turncoat,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,155,Fall,1902
yeah i‚Äôm gonna try and butter him up a little by saying i‚Äôm worried about you and turkey,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,156,Fall,1902
speaking of i have a feeling turkey doesn‚Äôt like me especially after that bounce are you sure he‚Äôll support me into gre,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,157,Fall,1902
ive given them the sweet talk about how its all temporary and well kill you later blah blah so i think theyre sufficiently convinced to do it,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,158,Fall,1902
okay because me getting gre doesn‚Äôt really leave him with anything of austria,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,159,Fall,1902
theyve told me that theyre willing to accept that so long as youre going to be an immediate target obviously im reassuring them as to that fact but intend asap to execute the plan that i had had in mind before austria ruined my attack plan,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,160,Fall,1902
because i think that plan was sweet and im pissed that i didnt get to do it,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,161,Fall,1902
hahahaha it was sweet austria should go down quick though i‚Äôd say the only variables are if turkey gets their fleet too far out it will slow me down and if france gets aggressive,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,162,Fall,1902
with the builds i get from austria if all goes right i should be able to crush turkey with no more support from you than is necessary to claim your fair share of builds to use on the french front hopefully,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,163,Fall,1902
üëçüèª,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,164,Fall,1902
also worried about if turkey doesn‚Äôt play ball but you have to take risks sometimes,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,165,Fall,1902
yeah hopefully we go 23 for risky alliances the second successful case being the germans thusfar,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,166,Fall,1902
that‚Äôs my favorite part about the italyrussia alliance it‚Äôs very mutually beneficial and doesn‚Äôt take much risk,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,167,Fall,1902
the only problem being that in the early game its very difficult to mutually support,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,168,Fall,1902
this is true,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,169,Fall,1902
soon enough well be able to though hopefully,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,170,Fall,1902
yeah if austria goes down,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,171,Fall,1902
oh my god austria has no idea how this game even works,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,172,Fall,1902
apparently they betrayed me because they knew i was up to something because theres no way that they could have taken bulgaria but its pretty obvious that they could greece goes to bulgaria serbia supports f ionian breaks the aegeans support im so fucking frustrated,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,173,Fall,1902
that‚Äôs very annoying who told you that austria,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,174,Fall,1902
the austrians themselves told me that yes,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,175,Fall,1902
i meant to say turkey,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,176,Fall,1902
ah no the austrians themselves admitted that thats the reason they betrayed me last turn they were talking about twenty minutes ago,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,177,Fall,1902
turkey is being cagey about letting me into gre can you prod or at least find out if they‚Äôre gonna do it,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,178,Fall,1902
will do my best,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,179,Fall,1902
they say yes that that is the plan was a very brief message though,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,180,Fall,1902
yeah he said he‚Äôs supporting me in,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,181,Fall,1902
what‚Äôre your moves this round just curious how things are gonna work i‚Äôll share mine too if it makes you uncomfortable,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,182,Fall,1902
good good and hes supporting the convoy from tunis yes,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,183,Fall,1902
yes,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,184,Fall,1902
im going to protect warsaw and do everything i can to hold onto rumania i fed the austrians some bullshit lines trying to get them to back off and focus on the turkish threat hopefully thatll work black seas going to support rumania to hold and ukraines moving to warsaw,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,185,Fall,1902
yeah i have austria supporting me into the aegean with gre so that‚Äôll be a wasted move,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,186,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm gonna hold in tys and move into tyr,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,187,Fall,1902
good can you get them to tell you what theyll be doing with the rest of their units i need to know whether to defend warsaw or rumania,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,188,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm gonna try and get turkey to hit ser to cut any potential support,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,189,Fall,1902
yeah i‚Äôll ask,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,190,Fall,1902
thanks ill admit its got me anxious,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,191,Fall,1902
are you too worried about rum to let bul hit ser to cut support,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,192,Fall,1902
or do you think we don‚Äôt need to worry he won‚Äôt support gre holding,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,193,Fall,1902
theres too many risks if you ask me if the austrians supported from greece to bulgaria wed get greece but the turks would lose bulgaria and wed have a shit time i dont think hell try to support greece holding,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,194,Fall,1902
yeah i‚Äôm realizing that he won‚Äôt either,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,195,Fall,1902
any specifics the most important one is what hell do with galicia,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,196,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm thinking about going tys to tus i don‚Äôt think france will move into tys if they stab because they should expect me to hold i‚Äôm guessing they would convoy or move into tus and pie right,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,197,Fall,1902
yeah i haven‚Äôt heard back yet i‚Äôm just guessing he won‚Äôt support gre because he doesn‚Äôt have a reason to,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,198,Fall,1902
that seems the most likely option i think its a good idea to do that the french have the opportunity to ruin you completely if they manage to secure both,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,199,Fall,1902
yeah i‚Äôm worried about that not sure what else i can do other than send ven to pie but i wanna get moving on austria,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,200,Fall,1902
the faster them and turkey are destroyed the faster you can pivot completely toward the french i just wish i could convince france that the english were a better option,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,201,Fall,1902
yeah they‚Äôre pretty annoying,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,202,Fall,1902
just like the real french,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,203,Fall,1902
hey now i happen to quite like the french in reality lol,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,204,Fall,1902
just messing around,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,205,Fall,1902
i gotcha the france in this game definitely has their general aloofness down pat for sure though,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,206,Fall,1902
they‚Äôre very difficult to negotiate with they are saying that me being in lyo is more risky for them than them being in tys is for me,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,207,Fall,1902
thats a stinking lie and they know it,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,208,Fall,1902
exactly,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,209,Fall,1902
france all of the sudden agreed pretty suspicious,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,210,Fall,1902
extremely dont trust them,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,211,Fall,1902
moving into tus is a win win either i‚Äôm prepared for the attack or we both move out of the spaces and the dmz is active,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,212,Fall,1902
yea gods if only the austrians hadnt been chief among morons wed be in such a better spot,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,213,Fall,1902
this will be a big turn,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,214,Fall,1902
indeed this is big makeorbreak time,1,False,2,russia,italy,9,215,Fall,1902
yeah we‚Äôre taking a lot of risks france and austria could attack me turkey could screw us up,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,216,Fall,1902
hell if the british get tricky again the germans may not recover,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,217,Fall,1902
yeah they‚Äôre worried about england holding hol otherwise england might not recover,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,218,Fall,1902
well if england fails to recover we might have a shot at this yet,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,219,Fall,1902
it‚Äôll be interesting,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,220,Fall,1902
you have no idea how much information you can get from some people if you feign a willingness to betray an ally the english have effectively handed the war in the north to me if theyre telling the truth and if they arent it proceeds as normal anyways,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,221,Fall,1902
what‚Äôd they say,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,222,Fall,1902
with the promise to betray the germans in a turns time theyve agreed to back away from st petersburg told me a great deal of frances plans and given me an opening to break through their fleets if all goes according to plan,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,223,Fall,1902
and if theyre lying then nothing of value was lost,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,224,Fall,1902
so what‚Äôre france‚Äôs plans,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,225,Fall,1902
and nice work,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,226,Fall,1902
i only got information as pertains to germany unfortunately theyre allegedly not going to menace munich but instead throw all their support against belgium,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,227,Fall,1902
nice should help you and germany our,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,228,Fall,1902
out,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,229,Fall,1902
i certainly hope so any blow struck against the british and french is a possible relief to you,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,230,Fall,1902
yeah i‚Äôm really hoping france doesn‚Äôt hit me and i get gre,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,231,Fall,1902
that would be the ideal situation i shudder to think of the worstcase this turn though,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,232,Fall,1902
i might have to stay up and see what happens,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,233,Fall,1902
i have no choice but to either way im busily researching for a big paper i have to write by the end of the week,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,234,Fall,1902
college,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,235,Fall,1902
yeeeeep its a real pain in the ass,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,236,Fall,1902
it really is,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,237,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm in finals this week,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,238,Fall,1902
same though its mostly over i had two today,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,239,Fall,1902
same i‚Äôm done tomorrow i‚Äôm at msu,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,240,Fall,1902
iupui myself,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,241,Fall,1902
good stuff,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,242,Fall,1902
well prayers up for good grades and good luck with france,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,243,Fall,1902
ill drink to that,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,244,Fall,1902
aside from france making a move on you i could not be happier with the results,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,245,Fall,1902
true,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,246,Winter,1902
ok so if the french werent riding your ass we could make amazing progress this year but unfortunately they are unfortunately as well the turks are rearing to get at you too ill convince them otherwise and if we make sufficient progress unfortunately the only way i envision it working is if the turks get serbia for now similar with how the austrians would have gotten bulgaria i will be in budapest and if things go really well ill stab the turks before years end to keep their minds off of you if the french back off we can easily get you trieste and then start making serious gains on your front  hows that sound as far as a general road map goes considering the situation i think that it would also be far more expedient for us to switch smyrna for vienna in our center shares but i understand if youd prefer to stick with what we had planned previously,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,247,Winter,1902
yeah i already told turkey they could have ser it was part of negotiating gre and yes france is really ruining things i could lose ven if they coordinate with austria which is probably somewhat unlikely since austria has stabbed everyone so far this game,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,248,Winter,1902
i‚Äôm not sure if we will need to switch those but i am open to figuring it out when the time comes,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,249,Winter,1902
even if they do coordinate the only way they can guarantee it is by moving with the fleet in the adriatic this turn and you can take it back immediately after that if the turks and i work together to disrupt the hell out of them  the current worst case is that the french can now support the convoy move into tuscany,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,250,Winter,1902
i‚Äôll be building an army in ven which will help with everything,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,251,Winter,1902
it will indeed things are going to be extremely rough if the french dont decide that they need to pull back,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,252,Winter,1902
yeah hopefully you can convince them,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,253,Winter,1902
i‚Äôll be arguing it too,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,254,Winter,1902
you could also try to tell the austrians that if theyre going to be cool now that youll back off but they seem fully in league with the french,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,255,Winter,1902
maybe try to convince them to disband adriatic rather than albania,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,256,Winter,1902
worth a shot,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,257,Winter,1902
i moved into tyr though,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,258,Winter,1902
well if they do that you can support tyr into piedmont and send tys to tus and that would not only block the french convoy again but force the french to retreat its worth a shot,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,259,Winter,1902
yeah i‚Äôll see,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,260,Winter,1902
hang on let me pitch it as getting the italians to back off rather than as you offering it might be that they trust me more since they backed off of galicia when i asked,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,261,Winter,1902
that‚Äôs fair,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,262,Winter,1902
as soon as they respond ill tell you what they said that would be a godsend in backing the french away even if itd be a setback on the austrian front im more worried about the french dont know about you,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,263,Winter,1902
i am too i can‚Äôt fight on two fronts,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,264,Winter,1902
as long as you hold the french off and and i can hold the turks back long enough to put them down easy it shouldnt be too much of a crisis and here i thought the sweating would be over after last seasons results silly me,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,265,Winter,1902
it‚Äôll be interesting for sure üòÇ,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,266,Winter,1902
hopefully the pressure that im about to lay down in the north will be enough to get the french concerned and pull back,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,267,Winter,1902
i‚Äôm still trying to figure out if there‚Äôs a way to split the england france alliance not sure who would be more likely to attack who but either way it would cause the french to retreat,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,268,Winter,1902
soon enough ill have the english on the ropes if everything goes as i intend it to that would definitely cause the french to need to reassess the situation,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,269,Winter,1902
france sounds a little apologetic and defeated could be a ruse but i‚Äôm hopeful,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,270,Winter,1902
it is 100 a ruse dont believe them for a second,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,271,Winter,1902
hahaha i would never move differently because of it just hoping it is followed by a retreat,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,272,Winter,1902
what‚Äôre you doing for your build,1,,-2,italy,russia,9,273,Winter,1902
thatd be super cool i asked the turks if i was allowed to build in sevastopol because i want to convoy from there to one of their home supply centers when the time comes,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,274,Winter,1902
i obviously didnt tell them that last part,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,275,Winter,1902
hahahahaha we‚Äôll see what they say then,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,276,Winter,1902
the austrians did it the mad bastards they deleted the fleet in the adriatic,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,277,Spring,1903
hahaha did you suggest that,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,278,Spring,1903
i did indeed didnt expect it to work but here we are,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,279,Spring,1903
wonderful that will make defense easier,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,280,Spring,1903
for me,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,281,Spring,1903
well it means that you can support yourself into piedmont and make it impossible to lose venice at least not until next year,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,282,Spring,1903
the only hurdle is determining whether or not the french are going to try to convoy again or try a different plan of attack,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,283,Spring,1903
yeah it‚Äôs gonna be tough i‚Äôm gonna have to play cautious,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,284,Spring,1903
lol france is out here trying to get me to let him into tyr,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,285,Spring,1903
foh,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,286,Spring,1903
üòÇ,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,287,Spring,1903
this fucking guy lol,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,288,Spring,1903
like what kind of wacky races plan does he think hes gonna pull off,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,289,Spring,1903
he claimed it would be low risk,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,290,Spring,1903
i told him low risk is him turning around and attacking england,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,291,Spring,1903
if you want turkey to take ser then you should hit bud i‚Äôm supporting him in,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,292,Spring,1903
i think you should we will have turkey in a corner and he trusts you it‚Äôs okay if he gets a build as long as it comes from austria,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,293,Spring,1903
im attacking budapest as my part yeah,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,294,Spring,1903
though doesnt supporting him have the same effect with less rksk,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,295,Spring,1903
true either way works,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,296,Spring,1903
the fucking people i‚Äôm this game good god,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,297,Fall,1903
in,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,298,Fall,1903
god the turks ugh,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,299,Fall,1903
you could have had ionian support greece not that it would have mattered,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,300,Fall,1903
took a big risk trusting the french to back off,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,301,Fall,1903
i realized that even if they didn‚Äôt back off i would be able to respond,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,302,Fall,1903
and yeah i should have had the support in i was changing my orders last minute and didn‚Äôt fix that but yeah it would not have mattered,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,303,Fall,1903
what do you want from tri,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,304,Fall,1903
if you could support me into budapest from there i can support you into effectively all of the territories you need from austriaturkey aside from greece and bulgaria,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,305,Fall,1903
im moving from galicia sorry thats necessary information,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,306,Fall,1903
will do,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,307,Fall,1903
turks are gonna be pissed when they see the news,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,308,Winter,1903
good work lots of builds for you i will have to catch up kind of sucks that england quit,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,309,Winter,1903
it does but considering how things were going for them i dont exactly blame them especially since the french were just about to turn coat,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,310,Winter,1903
so which do you want first vienna or serbia,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,311,Winter,1903
not sure yet cleaning this up is gonna be a mess hopefully germany can keep france small enough while we do it,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,312,Winter,1903
i dont think we can keep the french from getting one build but if all goes well we can get you two builds at least then pick up the others the next year and be ready to turn around and finish off the french,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,313,Winter,1903
i might go army the turks are so weak that i think the fleet would be a waste,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,314,Winter,1903
and if you do it right they will have to disband bul,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,315,Winter,1903
i would assume turkey will stop attacking ion now that it had to defend itself,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,316,Winter,1903
i dont think itd be a bad idea to have a third army running around especially since youll have more builds to consider stocking up on them in the near future im guessing the turks are going to withdraw both fleets to smyrna and constantinople respectively but if you have the ionian poke the aegean and i have rumania poke bulgaria i can guarantee that my fleet makes it into constantinople and from there we can guarantee your fleet makes it into the aegean from there youll have smyrna and at the same time youll have armies marching into greece and bulgaria if all goes well,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,317,Winter,1903
i was thinking about negotiating a mutual retreat with france and then being sneaky and moving into wes could slow them down i‚Äôll have to look at the board more though to see if it would be too much them retaliating into tys could be rough but if they actually retreat i‚Äôd be fine or my armies might be enough to keep him from hitting an sc,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,318,Winter,1903
i‚Äôm gonna look into it more,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,319,Winter,1903
and yes i like everything you said up there,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,320,Winter,1903
what are you thinking after this will you be eating germany,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,321,Winter,1903
you have been wonderful all game but as you hit double digits i have to start worrying about a solo,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,322,Winter,1903
i dont think that doing serbia or vienna first has any material difference honestly though serbia first would mean you could possibly take greece this year as well  as far as my plans go i admit that a solo would be nice but i have no intent of turning on either you or the germans i already proposed a 3 way draw to the germans and they have said that theyre all for it,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,323,Winter,1903
obviously sounds great to me it‚Äôs kind of being handed to us at this point üòÇ,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,324,Winter,1903
i certainly dont blame you for worrying but if i intended to go alone id have no reason to help you into all the bits of turkey and austria weve agreed to which youll see i wont fail to do,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,325,Winter,1903
so what will you be doing with all those other units then,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,326,Winter,1903
makes sense,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,327,Winter,1903
well me and germany will have our eyes on you üòâ,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,328,Winter,1903
yeah the austrians had me worried for a while there but convincing them to back off put things nicely back on track for me at least and once we have austria and turkey dead ill likely keep most of my units in and around ukraine with the exception of any which could better be used to help you or germany out in limited enough number to keep from doing anything even if i did intend to turn on you two of course üòú,1,,5,russia,italy,9,329,Winter,1903
id hate to get you two worried about it,1,,5,russia,italy,9,330,Winter,1903
and lol yeah im sure you will,1,,5,russia,italy,9,331,Winter,1903
vienna and serbia both present effectively the same problems whether you go for one of them first or the other,1,,5,russia,italy,9,332,Winter,1903
yeah i was thinking about that too not positive how i wanna tackle it,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,333,Winter,1903
yeah france is already trying to get me to turn on you,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,334,Winter,1903
so i figure his only chance is to either get you folks to turn on me or get me to turn on you,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,335,Spring,1904
i think of the two going for vienna first is the most safe,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,336,Spring,1904
okay that‚Äôs fine with me,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,337,Spring,1904
sorry i just remembered i was supposed to attack with ion ended up not mattering,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,338,Spring,1904
no worries though it did just occur to me that if both turkey and austria are going to go into civil disorder that you could have also had greece this turn if we went for serbia first,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,339,Spring,1904
yeah this is gonna be weird,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,340,Spring,1904
of course they will wake up as soon as we start assuming that,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,341,Spring,1904
naturally which is why we should continue to act as though they were both still around,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,342,Spring,1904
are you supporting me into ser and aeg or just ser,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,343,Fall,1904
never heard back about aeg so i didn‚Äôt want to risk turkey hitting ion and me not going anywhere sorry,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,344,Fall,1904
no worries its not a big deal all things considered,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,345,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm just glad you had that support to ser in,1,True,-5,italy,russia,9,346,Fall,1904
yep the austrians are effectively dead and the turks are going to follow quickly,1,True,5,russia,italy,9,347,Fall,1904
what luck bulgaria and greece are both walkins now ill start pulling away from our border in austria and the balkans,1,True,4,russia,italy,9,348,Spring,1905
yeah looking good,1,True,-4,italy,russia,9,349,Spring,1905
from what i can tell we don‚Äôt need to coordinate anything this season,1,True,-4,italy,russia,9,350,Spring,1905
not particularly things are going quite well,1,True,4,russia,italy,9,351,Spring,1905
i can support you into bulgaria just in case the turks unexpectedly submit orders though,1,True,4,russia,italy,9,352,Spring,1905
sounds good,1,True,-4,italy,russia,9,353,Spring,1905
think its time to pivot toward the french i can support your fleet from the ionian into the aegean and then into smyrna from there and thatll finish the turks,1,True,4,russia,italy,9,354,Fall,1905
will do,1,True,-4,italy,russia,9,355,Fall,1905
and last but not least i support you into smyrna and the turks are done for,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,356,Spring,1906
sounds great,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,357,Spring,1906
i think when turkey is eliminated we may be able to get france to surrender,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,358,Fall,1906
probably yes,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,359,Fall,1906
happy new year im going to be forcing my way into the midatlantic from there i can support you into spain youll probably end up being the one of us with 12 supply centers at the end considering the positioning of everything,1,True,2,russia,italy,9,360,Fall,1906
sounds wonderful happy new year to you as well,1,True,-2,italy,russia,9,361,Fall,1906
shall we request that france surrenders and announce the intentions of a three way,1,True,0,italy,russia,9,362,Spring,1907
that sounds right to me,1,True,0,russia,italy,9,363,Spring,1907
i will be supporting your fleet into por and setting my condition to three way win,1,True,0,italy,russia,9,364,Fall,1907
excellent support the germans into brest as well if you can,1,True,0,russia,italy,9,365,Fall,1907
hey italy just saying high i doubt we will cross paths until later in the game but if you feel so inclined you could attack france üòâ france is probably the strongest county and i think me you and germany should shut them down before they can get up and running anyways good luck and have fun,0,True,0,england,italy,9,0,Spring,1901
thanks for reaching out yeah as italy i will have to feel the board out before making any commitments,1,True,0,italy,england,9,1,Spring,1901
of course,1,True,0,england,italy,9,2,Spring,1901
things are looking pretty peaceful in the west,1,True,0,italy,england,9,3,Fall,1901
i would have thought france would have gone army in bre and fleet in mar do you know why he flipped them,1,True,-1,italy,england,9,4,Spring,1902
yes‚Äîhe said he wanted to get support to belgium but he could have done this with a fleet as well so i think it may have been an aggresive moveeven though he insists we are still allies and for this reason im going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you although not completely full fledgedthe fleet in spain and the army in mar just a fair warning and since it seems like you dont have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france up to you,0,True,1,england,italy,9,5,Spring,1902
oh yeah i can see that hit coming from a mile away the fleet going to sc is pretty obvious that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt build a fleet in mar,1,True,-1,italy,england,9,6,Spring,1902
i appreciate it though you worried about russia at all,1,True,-1,italy,england,9,7,Spring,1902
yep turkey is basically giving away centers i wouldnt be suprised if germanys back door opened up,1,True,1,england,italy,9,8,Spring,1902
yeah germany is pretty worried about you guys from what i have heard and turkey seems kinda dumb he‚Äôs been scared of me pulling a lepanto all game and it‚Äôs gonna cost him,1,True,-1,italy,england,9,9,Spring,1902
will you do me a favor and let france move into the mid atlantic for a turn we are trying to demilitarize the mediterranean but he needs to use the atlantic to get out of spain,1,True,-1,italy,england,9,10,Spring,1902
hi there i figured it would be good to open up talks between us what‚Äôre your initial thoughts i plan on playing rather conservatively until i see how some alliances are shaking out,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,0,Spring,1901
same on my end to be honest first game ive ever played with any money on the line lol,0,True,0,turkey,italy,9,1,Spring,1901
hm if youre okay starting conservatively could i make the ask that you start by opening to tyn or move to take tun with a fleet,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,2,Spring,1901
i‚Äôd still plan on moving into ion it gives me more options,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,3,Spring,1901
yea i have no issue with ion in and of itself  id just rather not see you also setting up a lepanto by prepping a convoy to tun p,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,4,Spring,1901
if you reeeally want to try a lepanto we can go for it lol but i think wed stall out a bit too much to make it worthwhile,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,5,Spring,1901
you know what a lepanto is right,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,6,Spring,1901
i may be an idiot but im not stupid ,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,7,Spring,1901
im just saying that if you come at me with a lepanto i dont think itd be beneficial for either of us lol,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,8,Spring,1901
got it sounded to me like you were proposing that you and i do a lepanto lol,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,9,Spring,1901
i doubt austria would trust me enough for that and yeah i‚Äôd have to catch you off guard so even you mentioning one makes it unrealistic,1,False,0,italy,turkey,9,10,Spring,1901
alrighty glad were on the same page  that means rome isnt going to apu or nap right ,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,11,Spring,1901
it is i‚Äôm not going to do a lepanto though you can try to defend against it if you‚Äôd like but it won‚Äôt do you any good i‚Äôm not trying to start a fight with austria immediately either,1,False,0,italy,turkey,9,12,Spring,1901
i realize this may be alarming to you but i quite honestly do not want to attack you in my experience a lepanto is a lot better deal for austria than italy i am truly planning on just getting my build and then reading the board,1,False,0,italy,turkey,9,13,Spring,1901
we can continue to negotiate if you would like to i don‚Äôt want to start off on the wrong foot,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,14,Spring,1901
have you heard from austria or russia yet i have not one reason i‚Äôm moving the way i am is because i have some interest in gre however i‚Äôm not going to try and sneakforce my way in there i was wondering if you and austria have talked about gre or if you and russia had discussed rum since that has some implications as well,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,15,Spring,1901

sure what do you have in mind,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,29,Fall,1902
i was hoping to get my army into gre i‚Äôd need support from you though we‚Äôd be able to get you into ser after that,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,30,Fall,1902
that sounds reasonable to me  geographically tho do you think it could make more sense for you to get tri and ser while i get greece,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,31,Fall,1902
maybe we could make that exchange later i was trying to get my army involved in things,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,32,Fall,1902
i guess a convoy to albania would be possible but then we might have to delay taking greece hmm,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,33,Fall,1902
yeah i‚Äôm trying to get that army involved and take a sc this turn because it‚Äôs fall plus i could use the build with france getting scary you don‚Äôt really have anyone attacking you,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,34,Fall,1902
alright thats fair yea putting in the order now then,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,35,Fall,1902
supporting tun to gre,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,36,Fall,1902
yep üëç,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,37,Fall,1902
thank you we‚Äôll get you some builds soon have you talked to russia about swapping rum if he takes more of austria,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,38,Fall,1902
we havent really  discussed that do you think theyd be open to it,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,39,Fall,1902
possibly i know he wants to get rid of austria pretty badly so,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,40,Fall,1902
what‚Äôre you doing with bul this round,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,41,Fall,1902
russia asked for it to support rum again,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,42,Fall,1902
what do you think about it attacking ser i think that would guarantee it can‚Äôt support gre holding or an attack on rum,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,43,Fall,1902
do you think that would work,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,44,Fall,1902
im a bit nervous about losing bul to be honest,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,45,Fall,1902
and i dont think the russians would be super pleased either,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,46,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm just trying to guarantee that i get gre you know,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,47,Fall,1902
is there a good way to do it,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,48,Fall,1902
yea i feel you,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,49,Fall,1902
gre is supporting me into the aeg obviously i‚Äôm not gonna actually move that way so that takes away one thing,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,50,Fall,1902
austria also has been talking to me about attacking russia so maybe i can leverage that,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,51,Fall,1902
yeah if you could get him to support bul to rum then we would know that he‚Äôs not attacking you or russia because obviously you won‚Äôt actually attack rum,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,52,Fall,1902
i think hed probably want to me to support him at this point while i would in theory be able to take sev but im not sure that helps us,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,53,Fall,1902
cuz that could just free up ser even more yknow,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,54,Fall,1902
alright ill be back online in a few hours  have to go give an exam,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,55,Fall,1902
understandable so currently you are supporting a rum hold with bul,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,56,Fall,1902
thats what i have yea,1,True,0,turkey,italy,9,57,Fall,1902
we can leave it as that,1,True,0,italy,turkey,9,58,Fall,1902
would you like support into ser this year,1,True,1,italy,turkey,9,59,Spring,1903
yes please thanks,1,True,-1,turkey,italy,9,60,Spring,1903
if u want to support aeg to con id appreciate it,1,False,-5,turkey,italy,9,61,Fall,1905
hi there i think us attacking each other early game is pretty dumb what‚Äôre your thoughts,1,True,0,italy,france,9,0,Spring,1901
i agree even with the element of surprise its just too easy to defend the piedmontmarseilles corridor  if france attacks italy it will most likely be austria who benefits and likewise if italy attacks france the spoils probably go to germany  given that what are your plans are you planning to attack austria early or thinking of the standard move of  f naples  ionian a rome  naples a venice h,1,True,0,france,italy,9,1,Spring,1901
yeah i‚Äôm not planning on going for austria off the bat i feel like it usually just locks the two weakest countries into a fight that hurts us both,1,True,0,italy,france,9,2,Spring,1901
understood good to know,1,True,0,france,italy,9,3,Spring,1901
seems like everything went pretty much according to plan not sure why turkey stayed in smy instead of backfilling to con seems a bit passive to me,1,True,0,france,italy,9,4,Fall,1901
he‚Äôs scared of me pulling off a lepanto what‚Äôs the deal for you guys seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of eng did you and germany agree to that bounce in bur,1,True,0,italy,france,9,5,Fall,1901
yeah england and i demilitarized the channel and the bounce with germany was arranged,1,True,0,france,italy,9,6,Fall,1901
looks like you guys still have to figure out your 2 on 1 then,1,True,0,italy,france,9,7,Fall,1901
my own view is that france can afford to remain neutral longer than england or germany can   as long as i can prevent an englishgerman alliance i can afford to remain noncommital and find the right time to strike  of course i already have a hypothesis for who i suspect would be the better ally but i dont think i can share that p,1,True,0,france,italy,9,8,Fall,1901
understandable,1,True,0,italy,france,9,9,Fall,1901
not sure if its true but i heard england has been telling you i plan to invade italy,1,True,1,france,italy,9,10,Spring,1902
would just like to point out that if that were the case i would have built a fleet in marseilles my priority is securing burgundy and thats why i built the army,1,True,1,france,italy,9,11,Spring,1902
i had heard that and was already suspicious your fleet going to sc of spain was alarming him telling me that made it worse the only way i will believe you is if your fleet moves back into the atlantic,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,12,Spring,1902
however there isn‚Äôt much i can do to attack you only defend,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,13,Spring,1902
in my view the fleet going to sc of spain is a concession to england but apparently he doesnt see things the same way i suggest that we demilitarize western mediterranean for now my fleet will go on standby in lyon to defend marseilles,1,True,1,france,italy,9,14,Spring,1902
why do you need to defend mar i do not want you in the lyon,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,15,Spring,1902
since gulf of lyon borders several of my supply centers and none of yours i view it as part of my territory however i would be willing to demilitirize it if you agree to demilitirize tyrrhenean sea which is to you what lyon is to me,1,True,1,france,italy,9,16,Spring,1902
that sounds like a good deal to me agreed,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,17,Spring,1902
so wes lyo and tys are a dmz,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,18,Spring,1902
let me confirm with england that theyre comfortable with me going to mid atlantic in order to get a portugal out but agreed if theres no issue there,1,True,1,france,italy,9,19,Spring,1902
okay let me know,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,20,Spring,1902
if england says no ill move to gulf of lyon first but return to spain it provides a temperary hedge while allowing a portugal to get out,1,True,1,france,italy,9,21,Spring,1902
understandable,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,22,Spring,1902
did you hear back yet,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,23,Spring,1902
until i hear otherwise from you i will be moving into tys,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,24,Spring,1902
apologies i didnt hear back from england until after i had retired for the night im in central europe time so turn change is early in the morning for me,1,True,1,france,italy,9,25,Fall,1902
occupying tys while i am in lyon is totally fair but we are now in a bit of a standoff,1,True,1,france,italy,9,26,Fall,1902
yeah we are in a weird position now how do you want to handle it,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,27,Fall,1902
here i my view tys is more vulnerable for me than lyo is for you it borders two of my home centers which as opposed to 1 home and 1 neutral for you additionally you are in a very good position to defend those centers if i were to move into lyo so i propose that i hold in tys and you move from lyo to spa sc i‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre moving spa to gas and when i see that i will leave tys and our dmz will be in effect,1,,-1,italy,france,9,28,Fall,1902
hmmm can i assume that f ionian will be going east against either turkey or austria,1,True,1,france,italy,9,29,Fall,1902
how is your relation with austria actually,1,True,1,france,italy,9,30,Fall,1902
the situation with germany and england has become very messy and delicate retreating to spain makes sense on paper but it is a very passive move which would also leave me vulnerable if you chase into lyo,1,True,1,france,italy,9,31,Fall,1902
not sure what ion is doing yet austria and i are still talking the relationship is good though,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,32,Fall,1902
has austria been responsive to you,1,True,1,france,italy,9,33,Fall,1902
they havent really responded to me for the most part,1,True,1,france,italy,9,34,Fall,1902
what is messy and delicate about it i think you can see that i will be attacking toward the east it would not make sense for me to send a lone fleet to attack you,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,35,Fall,1902
no they are hard to talk to they have about one time each day they respond to messages,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,36,Fall,1902
i mean if austria doesnt play ball i have no way to be sure that you wont pivot west,1,True,1,france,italy,9,37,Fall,1902
i think you would see that coming,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,38,Fall,1902
you will have a unit in mar and a unit in spa if you move from lyo to spa there wouldn‚Äôt be anything i could take,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,39,Fall,1902
we should figure this out before the game moves,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,40,Fall,1902
apologies was actually about to go to bed  missed your earlier messages,1,True,1,france,italy,9,41,Fall,1902
good to talk about it though,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,42,Fall,1902
but on further consideration i dont have a problem with you remaining in tys for now,1,True,1,france,italy,9,43,Fall,1902
youre right that its less threatening than i thought at first,1,True,1,france,italy,9,44,Fall,1902
will you be moving out of lyo to spa,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,45,Fall,1902
can do,0,False,1,france,italy,9,46,Fall,1902
yeah plus i have made no indication of attacking you this game,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,47,Fall,1902
thats true and appreciated,1,True,1,france,italy,9,48,Fall,1902
of course,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,49,Fall,1902
i realize that for now mar is gonna have to hold,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,50,Fall,1902
yeah theres nowhere it can really go the most i could do is f belgium s a burgundy  belgium a marseilles  burgundy but not only does this risk losing control of an important province in burgundy it leaves my fleet trapped in picardy where england would likely be offended,1,True,1,france,italy,9,51,Fall,1902
yeah it seems like england is being a pain do you think you guys will make headway with germany this round that would help give you guys some room,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,52,Fall,1902
,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,53,Fall,1902
is he worried about russia,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,54,Fall,1902
he has some justification to be worried about russia considering that russia hit norway in force and england wont be able to recover it,1,True,1,france,italy,9,55,Fall,1902
im guarrenteed to take belgium but need to see if england can hold holland and how germany disbands in order to get a better sense of whether we can continue to push against germany,1,True,1,france,italy,9,56,Fall,1902
makes sense,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,57,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm sure russia is trying to get you to help with england,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,58,Fall,1902
indeed as is germany,1,True,1,france,italy,9,59,Fall,1902
no surprises there,1,True,1,france,italy,9,60,Fall,1902
of course not france is always better off with england as a friend not really the other way around though it‚Äôs impressive that you pulled that off,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,61,Fall,1902
i think the dynamic does matter a bit but i think as soon as germany gambled hard for belgium it made it very difficult to come to a deal with them,1,True,1,france,italy,9,62,Fall,1902
yeah that was weird by him he was upset about england moving into hol but like it was open,1,True,-1,italy,france,9,63,Fall,1902
it was a really strange early game in general,1,True,1,france,italy,9,64,Fall,1902
even as the main beneficiary of early conflict between england and germany i wasnt quite sure what to make of it,1,True,1,france,italy,9,65,Fall,1902
naughty naughty,1,True,0,italy,france,9,66,Winter,1902
hehehe worth a shot,1,True,0,france,italy,9,67,Winter,1902
i had a pretty terrible turn all around was putting in moves at 2am central europe time and ended up with a bunch of misorders,1,True,0,france,italy,9,68,Winter,1902
not gonna pretend i put in a convoy order by accident though,1,True,0,france,italy,9,69,Winter,1902
i don‚Äôt suppose you‚Äôll realize you have bigger fish to fry and head back,1,True,0,italy,france,9,70,Winter,1902
there would be no hard feelings,1,True,0,italy,france,9,71,Winter,1902
will need to figure out how to recover from that misorder in general,1,True,0,france,italy,9,72,Winter,1902
england isn‚Äôt looking too good russia tricked him last round and now he‚Äôs kinda screwed,1,True,0,italy,france,9,73,Winter,1902
i‚Äôm getting a build in case you needed another reason to back off,1,True,0,italy,france,9,74,Winter,1902
yeah im not on top of my game right now but i did notice your build and englands dilemma,1,True,0,france,italy,9,75,Winter,1902
alright i put some thought into it i think we can turn this around into a mutually beneficial arrangement,1,True,0,france,italy,9,76,Spring,1903
i would like your permission to go to tyrolia,1,True,0,france,italy,9,77,Spring,1903
from there i can break through germanys line in munich and also support you into austria,1,False,0,france,italy,9,78,Spring,1903
i dont think theres too much risk on your end from being stabbed  that unit would be really isolated from the rest of my forces,1,False,0,france,italy,9,79,Spring,1903
if you agree suggest that you do a venice  piedmont  tyrolia and send a tyrolia  bohemia,1,True,0,france,italy,9,80,Spring,1903
i‚Äôm not going to do that the only benefits are things i could do myself,1,True,0,italy,france,9,81,Spring,1903
why do you not realize that england is an easier and better target for you,1,True,0,italy,france,9,82,Spring,1903
you can get his scs well before russia does,1,True,0,italy,france,9,83,Spring,1903
you have a point actually especially since this fight against germany is going nowhere,1,True,0,france,italy,9,84,Spring,1903
let me speak to germany about it,1,True,0,france,italy,9,85,Spring,1903
i know i‚Äôm biased but i think he‚Äôs a lot easier target than i am or germany is,1,True,0,italy,france,9,86,Spring,1903
part of why i sided with him over germany is that he seemed more competent but this is going nowhere time to reconsider,1,True,0,france,italy,9,87,Spring,1903
yeah you have been strangely loyal to him,1,True,0,italy,france,9,88,Spring,1903
i dont think it was a mistake to side with england at the start but i think i should have cut my losses earlier instead of not only sticking with him but also opening a second front against you,1,True,0,france,italy,9,89,Spring,1903
still waiting to hear back from germany but russia is on board and thats good enough for me germany has reason not to trust me and it might be good to make a demosntration of good faith anyways,1,True,0,france,italy,9,90,Spring,1903
ill draw down a pie  mar,1,True,0,france,italy,9,91,Spring,1903
would like to demilitarize pie going forward although it would be understandable if there are some hard feelings there,1,True,0,france,italy,9,92,Spring,1903
yeah we can build a dmz once you have pulled out,1,True,0,italy,france,9,93,Spring,1903
okay now we need to figure out tys and lyo,1,True,0,italy,france,9,94,Fall,1903
im perfectly content to just stay as is to be honest we could also bounce off each other with f lyo  tys f tys  lyo if youre worried about me going to wes,1,True,0,france,italy,9,95,Fall,1903
but if you have something else in mind im happy to hear it,1,True,0,france,italy,9,96,Fall,1903
i can‚Äôt be doing that i need to use it to support ion with turkey being dumb,1,True,0,italy,france,9,97,Fall,1903
let me think how late will you be checking messages tonight,1,True,0,italy,france,9,98,Fall,1903
probably not much later to be honest,1,True,0,france,italy,9,99,Fall,1903
been sleeping too late recently,1,True,0,france,italy,9,100,Fall,1903
im generally averse to just holding but i can do that for this turn if you need to support f ionian,1,True,0,france,italy,9,101,Fall,1903
can you just hold this turn instead of hitting it,1,True,0,italy,france,9,102,Fall,1903
make amends for my illfated incursion,1,True,0,france,italy,9,103,Fall,1903
was about to ask i‚Äôll fix it this coming year,1,True,0,italy,france,9,104,Fall,1903
thank you,1,True,0,italy,france,9,105,Fall,1903
thank you small amounts of trust regained,1,True,0,italy,france,9,106,Winter,1903
they are now twice as large as the next largest power,1,,0,france,italy,9,107,Winter,1903
we need to do something about russia,1,,0,france,italy,9,108,Winter,1903
yeah i know they‚Äôre getting big,1,True,0,italy,france,9,109,Winter,1903
turkey should be on board for sure and it seems like england dropped,1,True,0,france,italy,9,110,Winter,1903
so need to get germany on board,1,True,0,france,italy,9,111,Winter,1903
let them know that i promised to cooperate and that you will back them up if i break my word on this,1,True,0,france,italy,9,112,Winter,1903
i will aim to fight the russians in england while relieving the pressure on germany in the west,1,True,0,france,italy,9,113,Winter,1903
does this mean you are going to pull out of lyo,1,True,0,italy,france,9,114,Winter,1903
depends if you are pulling out of tys p,1,True,0,france,italy,9,115,Winter,1903
like i said earlier im perfectly content to just stay there but would also be willing to discuss demilitirization,1,True,0,france,italy,9,116,Winter,1903
how does me moving into tun sound,1,True,0,italy,france,9,117,Spring,1904
it would certain be the most parallel option to me moving to spain,1,True,0,france,italy,9,118,Spring,1904
sounds like a deal to me,1,True,0,italy,france,9,119,Spring,1904
sounds good,1,True,0,france,italy,9,120,Spring,1904
not a fan of your move to west med,1,True,-3,france,italy,9,121,Spring,1906
i know i havent really earned much trust from you but we need to present a united front against russia and germany or else russia will win,1,True,-3,france,italy,9,122,Spring,1906
no you haven‚Äôt,1,True,3,italy,france,9,123,Spring,1906
for what its worth ive kept our demilitirization since our discussion,1,True,-3,france,italy,9,124,Spring,1906
and germany is likely to be the main beneficiary in the event of a french collapse,1,True,-3,france,italy,9,125,Spring,1906
well looks like this is it for me,1,True,-6,france,italy,9,126,Fall,1907
given that i pissed away a winning position with an illadvised stab on you i doubt ill be missed much,1,True,-6,france,italy,9,127,Fall,1907
but best of luck for the rest of the game,1,True,-6,france,italy,9,128,Fall,1907
nah we‚Äôre going for a three way so that‚Äôs it for all of us good game though,1,True,6,italy,france,9,129,Fall,1907
how‚Äôs it going austria looking forward to a fun and exciting game,1,True,0,germany,austria,9,0,Spring,1901
hello germany  how do you feel about being friendly  if so lets leave boh and tyr as neutral zones  what do you think,1,True,0,austria,germany,9,1,Spring,1901
yeah let‚Äôs do it,1,True,0,germany,austria,9,2,Spring,1901
sounds great  hopefully when that plays out we can work together more in the future,1,True,0,austria,germany,9,3,Spring,1901
yeah for sure,1,False,0,germany,austria,9,4,Spring,1901
hey austria how‚Äôs it going,1,True,0,germany,austria,9,5,Winter,1901
doing great  your turn worked out reasonably well  thank you for keeping the territory neutral  is there anything we can currently work on together or should we continue to keep neutral for now,1,True,0,austria,germany,9,6,Spring,1902
i‚Äôd like to make sure the neutral territories in between us stay neutral boh tyr sil my only concern is that your move to vie is inching closer my way,1,True,0,germany,austria,9,7,Spring,1902
i will keep all of those as neutral  i think we can make good allies and hopefully able to help each other in the next year or so,1,True,0,austria,germany,9,8,Spring,1902
agreed looking forward to it,1,,0,germany,austria,9,9,Spring,1902
good evening i think its important that we get our affairs in order regarding sweden im sure you know that you can easily bounce me to keep me out but id like to convince you otherwise let me know if theres anything specific youd like in return otherwise i think that assistance against possible english attack and an agreement to leave warsaw silesia and prussia alone is good,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,0,Spring,1901
hi russia thanks for reaching out i‚Äôm open to an arrangement similar to those terms neutrality in pru sil war boh if that comes up as well as and really especially potential assistance against england i would also like your support into nwy down the road i think splitting scandinavia is reasonable and that takes pressure off of me to look to war as a future build how does that sound to you looking forward to a fun and exciting game,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,1,Spring,1901
id prefer for us to cooperate to take the british down completely i get norway you get as many british home territories as you can convince the french to let you have aside from that those neutral zones sound good to me,1,False,1,russia,germany,9,2,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm not sure i‚Äôm ready to just hand over norway and sweden unfortunately,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,3,Spring,1901
youll get norway then,0,False,1,russia,germany,9,4,Spring,1901
sounds good to me thank you so much for being agreeable i view norway as a gesture of goodwill and i will definitely remember it hopefully i will find another way to help you in the future üòÉ,1,False,-1,germany,russia,9,5,Spring,1901
hey what‚Äôs up russia,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,6,Winter,1901
not much austria moving toward viennas a little weird right think thats because theyre going to make a second fleet or something,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,7,Winter,1901
oh damn i didnt even see the brits moving into holland was that planned,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,8,Winter,1901
yeah obviously not which is why i reached out,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,9,Winter,1901
it looks like you‚Äôre going to have a fight on your hands in scandinavia and i am very willing to help you however i can,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,10,Winter,1901
well seeing as itd be pretty difficult for me to let you have norway at this point we should probably talk about that first i was already building a fleet on the north coast of st petersburg just for insurance against the brits but that can easily become an offensive if you broke any possible support from the north sea i could walk into norway in spring,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,11,Winter,1901
count me in,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,12,Winter,1901
alright from there i can try to push them out of the northnorwegian seas and you can move into the netherlands and beyond have you talked with the french we dont necessarily need them but for a proper sealion their help would definitely be a good thing to have,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,13,Winter,1901
yeah agreed my theoryfear is that they may be in negotiations with england france was asking me to take denmark and holland and then all of the sudden changed course and supported my incursion into belgium,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,14,Winter,1901
that is awfully suspicious,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,15,Winter,1901
agreed,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,16,Winter,1901
ill probe them for information let me see what i can get out of them even if they were involved with that theyll probably play their cards pretty close to the chest though,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,17,Winter,1901
agreed i will reach out to austria to see what‚Äôs going on there,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,18,Winter,1901
dont expect much the austrians arent exactly what id call chatty,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,19,Winter,1901
part of me wants to take the chanel to keep england on the defensive haha,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,20,Winter,1901
thatd be a hell of a move if it worked but i guarantee theyre going to be trying to move there to attempt to put themselves in belgium so youd only end up bouncing them,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,21,Winter,1901
ill talk with the brits too to see if theyll flash their plans at me im on decent terms with them,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,22,Winter,1901
that would be great,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,23,Winter,1901
the british are immensely cocky about their chances against you i wouldnt be even slightly surprised to find that they have the french in their pocket for the time being,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,24,Winter,1901
thank you for the intel what would you advise for me moving forward particularly with my two incoming builds,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,25,Winter,1901
considering what were up against id build a fleet in kiel and an army in berlin but you need to switch the army in denmark for a fleet as soon as possible and get that down to the french border,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,26,Winter,1901
if france and britain are determined to they can ensure that the fleet in belgium is destroyed unfortunately but they cant do that while also holding both norway and the netherlands,1,,1,russia,germany,9,27,Winter,1901
the english and french both made some odd choices with their builds i think the british anticipate me coming for them,1,False,1,russia,germany,9,28,Spring,1902
not great,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,29,Spring,1902
either way i think ill be able to outmaneuver them long enough to force a disband,1,,1,russia,germany,9,30,Spring,1902
have you spoken with the french recently they havent done anything overtly aggressive toward you so maybe you can still flip them ive got reliable intelligence that apparently the english dont approve of that fleet build in brest so we might be able to break that alliance up with a determined effort,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,31,Spring,1902
that‚Äôs wonderful news we‚Äôve spoken a bit he doesn‚Äôt seem particularly committed to england but the two of them have been speaking,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,32,Spring,1902
theyre savvy i think theyre playing both sides of the table until it becomes clear who has the upper hand,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,33,Spring,1902
agreed we need to be in sync with our moves to play the advantage let me know what you think would be good next steps for me,1,,-1,germany,russia,9,34,Spring,1902
the near term goal in my mind is breaking england to persuade france to complete the sea lion,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,35,Spring,1902
im trying to sow distrust among them at the moment but i dont know if ill have much luck with england theyre being very cagey but anyways the survival of your fleet in belgium at this point depends on you either convincing the french not to block you out of either the english channel or piedmont or using the fleet in kiel to support an attack against the army in the netherlands the first isnt ideal because its relying on the french but the second isnt ideal because its keeping kiel stationary and thus blocking the exit of the danish army which is practically deadweight where it is since it cant support to any of the seazones around it   id move munich to ruhr and berlin to munich additionally i would do the second option with your fleets whether or not you get an agreement from the french it leaves you in a much better strategic position even though it effectively ensures the loss of belgium,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,36,Spring,1902
current orders f bel h a den h a ber  kie f kie  hel a mun s ber  kie,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,37,Spring,1902
i‚Äôve been have good conversations with france,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,38,Spring,1902
if youre going to have belgium hold you might as well have it bounce off of the north sea to break any possible support that it can give either to holland or norway i have as well im doing everything i can to convince them that attacking the british is a great idea,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,39,Spring,1902
nice good call any other suggestions i‚Äôm pretty open to anything,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,40,Spring,1902
italy says that france and england are allies,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,41,Spring,1902
they are but ive been working to break it up ive not got any suggestions for the time being other than what you have you should be able to guarantee that you have holland by the end of the year though you may lose belgium in the process,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,42,Spring,1902
cool as long as your on board with my current moveset plus the bounce into the north sea,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,43,Spring,1902
i absolutely am hopefully the french either stay uncommitted to the attack or join our side,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,44,Spring,1902
i ran those other moves by france with the except of the north sea move you suggested should i tell france to build trust or would the potential of it getting back to england be risky,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,45,Spring,1902
i think that its almost guaranteed that it would get back to the english i wouldnt tell them much more about your plans at all if you can help it,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,46,Spring,1902
sounds good let me know if you have any other thoughts if not my moves are submitted,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,47,Spring,1902
if something crosses my mind ill let you know asap,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,48,Spring,1902
great call with the north sea,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,49,Fall,1902
what are you thinking for my next steps i don‚Äôt like france‚Äôs moves,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,50,Fall,1902
france is definitely coming for you but hows this for a tricksy little solution to the issue   currently you are at serious risk of losing belgium that sucks but if you move yourself to holland you can avoid the destruction of that fleet even better though if you make another move toward the north sea i can now support that move with norway meaning that unless the british successfully predict that you are in position to take edinburgh and threaten london unless they pull fleets back if they pull fleets back it takes pressure off of me and allows me to forwarddeploy my own fleets which are currently pinned down by british blockade  furthermore you can move your fleet from the helgoland bight into holland to take it and use kiel to support munich to ensure munich holds for long enough that the british have to disband there are risks involved in the maneuver of course the british could not only move themselves to belgium but they could move their fleet from the north sea into holland bouncing you out and keeping all of their forces intact despite the loss of the north sea,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,51,Fall,1902
word i actually love that strategy,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,52,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm in we need to think strategically about what information we deliver to englandfrance and how,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,53,Fall,1902
so ill be supporting from belgium to the north sea then theres a further significant risk that the british will use one of their fleets in the north to defeat norways support and thus keep the north sea and netherlands and take belgium  personally i actually am not a fan of the move too many risks to be realistically successful this turn better saved until next year i think youre better off using the helgoland bight to support belgium in a retreat to holland for the time being and then perform this maneuver next year when your position is more solid and the british have lost a unit if munich werent under enough risk that you could use kiel to support into holland as well it would be much more viable  sorry to be doing all these thought problems in full view im just trying to work out how best to break britain and get ourselves on the offensive this turn aint it though i think,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,54,Fall,1902
doesnt help that the austrians are actively betraying me,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,55,Fall,1902
no no i trust your judgement if we‚Äôre going to win this fight against england we need to be lock step,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,56,Fall,1902
i couldnt agree more,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,57,Fall,1902
no it does not i have minimal communication with them we basically exchanged a half dozen messages keeping the neutral territories neutral,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,58,Fall,1902
just so you know in advance given my newfound conflict with them i may have to occupy warsaw indefinitely,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,59,Fall,1902
thanks for bringing that up totally fine with me i have bigger problems for the foreseeable future  fighting with my one reliable ally is the last thing i want,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,60,Fall,1902
yeah its a real touchandgo situation but i really think that reducing the british for the time being was good progress,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,61,Fall,1902
yeah for sure,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,62,Fall,1902
what full moveset would you recommend for me,1,,-1,germany,russia,9,63,Fall,1902
a kie s mun a mun h f bel  hol f hel s bel  hol a den h  this moveset still leaves some risk if they anticipate it unfortunately but i doubt that theyd risk me being able to move to ska for it we can only hope though your position is still extremely unstable,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,64,Fall,1902
where is that london army going that‚Äôs my question,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,65,Fall,1902
france is telling me that i need to cede belgium to him for any further cooperation while i crave france coming on board for the sea lion i don‚Äôt trust anything he says,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,66,Fall,1902
well it tried to go to norway if the british anticipate me being conservatively defensive in norway which is my current plan then theres the possibility that they will attempt to convoy it to holland with ruhrs support which wouldnt succeed but would bounce you enough that theyd keep it  either way you cant stop the french from taking belgium anyways you might as well agree for the time being,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,67,Fall,1902
yeah that‚Äôs fair,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,68,Fall,1902
how are your conversations with france going,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,69,Fall,1902
ive got a tricky plan to either reverse psychology them into putting us in an advantageous position or find out if theyre trustworthy standby,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,70,Fall,1902
dope,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,71,Fall,1902
dont tell france anything even remotely specific for the time being they might just be feigning this willingness to cooperate in order to get strategically useful information to plan their next attack to ideally counter whatever you tell them,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,72,Fall,1902
yeah that‚Äôs a good read,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,73,Fall,1902
by the way im currently buttering them up with some nonsense about not giving a toss about you if they come to you as if delivering that as a world shattering revelation dont be fooled im playing them,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,74,Fall,1902
okay word,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,75,Fall,1902
yup yup just didnt want you to be alarmed if the french tried to get you to come after me over some bullshit i said to them,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,76,Fall,1902
word sounds good,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,77,Fall,1902
dont think i accomplished much honestly,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,78,Fall,1902
that‚Äôs unfortunate but not unexpected,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,79,Fall,1902
yeah hopefully everything goes well this season,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,80,Fall,1902
hopefully i can at least help you beat them in the future lol,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,81,Fall,1902
well if i can break this blockade the british have me in then ill be out there in a flash to defeat them with you,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,82,Fall,1902

my current moves fyi,1,True,-1,germany,russia,9,86,Fall,1902
yep that looks solid to me,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,87,Fall,1902
news from the front the english just blabbed offhand to me that the french are going to support themselves into belgium which means munich isnt at risk i dont know if i trust that intelligence but it would mean you could use kiel to ensure entry into the netherlands,1,True,1,russia,germany,9,88,Fall,1902
the english are either far more gullible and temperamental than the english or theyre trying to play me,1,,1,russia,germany,9,89,Fall,1902
i think i might have them duped they just said that theyre going to come talk to you please relay back what they told you maintain the original order set again my duping them effectively was me agreeing to fuck you over so be aware if they come to you with that nonsense,1,,1,russia,germany,9,90,Fall,1902
cheers i could hardly have imagined better results,1,True,2,russia,germany,9,91,Winter,1902
thanks so much hopefully english occupation of belgium will weaken their alliance,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,92,Winter,1902
england accidentally sent me a message,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,93,Winter,1902
‚Äúgermany doesn‚Äôt have to disband‚Äù,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,94,Winter,1902
you can tell he‚Äôs annoyed lol,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,95,Winter,1902
well of course he is the french supported him into belgium though so it was probably just so that they wouldnt have to disband two units i honestly wish the french would have taken it instead you probably wouldnt have the army in the ruhr sitting around in your business,1,True,2,russia,germany,9,96,Winter,1902
yeah it‚Äôs frustrating,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,97,Spring,1903
i‚Äôm worried about holding munich and holland,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,98,Spring,1903
i would also love to see us dislodge england from the north sea,1,,-2,germany,russia,9,99,Spring,1903
hey france is asking me to attack north sea he said he wants to turn on england,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,100,Spring,1903
he told me the same i dont believe him for a second,1,True,2,russia,germany,9,101,Spring,1903
he says   f pic  eng a brit  pic f hol  f nwy sf hel  nth a kie s f hol h,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,102,Spring,1903
yeah he wants to get you out of position,1,True,2,russia,germany,9,103,Spring,1903
what moves do you suggest,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,104,Spring,1903
i would take a defensive stance for now support netherlands and munich while i move into the norwegian sea,1,True,2,russia,germany,9,105,Spring,1903
a den s kie f hel s hol f hol h a kie s mun a mun h,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,106,Spring,1903

looks like france is sincere,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,108,Fall,1903
thats rare,1,True,2,russia,germany,9,109,Fall,1903
norway will support helgoland bight to the north sea if you use netherlands to support as well they may have a hard time stopping us kiel needs to move into ruhr yesterday though use munich to support if you can,1,True,2,russia,germany,9,110,Fall,1903
i‚Äôm in,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,111,Fall,1903
a den  kie f hel  nth f hol s hel  nth a kie  ruh a mun s kie  ruh,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,112,Fall,1903

so i can convoy it to the island in the spring,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,114,Fall,1903
sounds solid to me,1,True,2,russia,germany,9,115,Fall,1903
what‚Äôs your long term thinking once we get the leg up on england,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,116,Fall,1903
well once youre in ruhr and the north sea you can easily muscle your way through the french with italys help the italians and i take out the austrians and turks we end this with a three way draw if we all stay cordial,1,True,2,russia,germany,9,117,Fall,1903
i‚Äôm down i‚Äôve been getting a long great with italy literally nothing would make me happier than that plan,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,118,Fall,1903
yeah the time limit on this game isnt nearly enough to seek out a solo win anyways so might as well have a ni e draw with the folks ive been trusting the whole game,1,True,2,russia,germany,9,119,Fall,1903
yeah i agree honestly makes it more fun as well,1,True,-2,germany,russia,9,120,Fall,1903
yep,1,True,2,russia,germany,9,121,Fall,1903
looks like the french had the same general idea as you should i support your convoy to yorkshire with the fleet in edinburgh,1,,5,russia,germany,9,122,Winter,1903
that would be great thanks,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,123,Winter,1903
what full move set do you advise,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,124,Spring,1904
ruhr supports netherlands to belgium north sea convoys denmark to yorkshire munich holds,1,True,5,russia,germany,9,125,Spring,1904
what are your thoughts on ruhr to belgium supported by netherlands,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,126,Spring,1904
would mean the fleet in the netherlands isnt accomplishing anything in the future and would leave ruhr open to a possible sneak by the french wouldnt recommend,1,True,5,russia,germany,9,127,Spring,1904
makes sense can the english navy retreat to the netherlands,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,128,Spring,1904
no you cant retreat to where the attack originated,1,True,5,russia,germany,9,129,Spring,1904
dope,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,130,Spring,1904
hey russia what do you suggest for my next moveset i don‚Äôt want france to get two english supply centers haha,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,131,Fall,1904
make a move on liverpool alone at worst youll bounce and ill be moving to clyde to help you next season you should push into the english channel and try to sneak into burgundy at the same time,1,True,5,russia,germany,9,132,Fall,1904
so what specific moves i was actually thinking of supporting my army into london with the north sea to lock in another build,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,133,Fall,1904
then a ruh  bur supported by mun,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,134,Fall,1904
f bel h,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,135,Fall,1904
more longterm gain in taking the channel,1,True,5,russia,germany,9,136,Fall,1904
how so with the north sea fleet,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,137,Fall,1904
so the moves would be  a yorkshire to liverpool a ruhr to burgundy a munich s the above f north sea to english channel f belgium s the above,1,,5,russia,germany,9,138,Fall,1904
with the english channel you can practically walk across france while they panic and shit themselves trying to stop you,1,,5,russia,germany,9,139,Fall,1904
my fear is the fleet in london taking the north sea,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,140,Fall,1904
you want my fleet in norway to follow up,1,True,5,russia,germany,9,141,Fall,1904

i‚Äôm okay with that but i want to hold the north sea long term,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,144,Fall,1904
sounds good to me,1,True,5,russia,germany,9,145,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm really happy with the russiagermanyitaly alliance 3 way victory game plan things are looking really good right now and i think it‚Äôs important that the three of us make sure we‚Äôre on the same page as to what that map looks like,1,False,-5,germany,russia,9,146,Fall,1904
agreed need to make sure were all relatively equal,1,True,5,russia,germany,9,147,Fall,1904
exactly i think eating up most of the french and english supply centers should bring me up to parity what do you think the balkans look like for you and italy,1,True,-5,germany,russia,9,148,Fall,1904
everything i dont have right now is going to italy,1,True,5,russia,germany,9,149,Fall,1904

hey russia things are looking good against france what do you recommend for my next move set,1,True,-4,germany,russia,9,191,Winter,1906
picardy to paris supported by burgundy munich hold belgium to picardy english channel to london supported by north sea liverpool to wales irish sea supports liverpool is safe because wales can just move straight back and so is edinburgh because i can just bounce them out there as well paris is occupied and safe picardy is primed to take brest,1,True,4,russia,germany,9,192,Winter,1906
paris cant hold because ill be using north atlantic to poke brest,1,True,4,russia,germany,9,193,Winter,1906
excellent thanks for all the help russia,1,True,-4,germany,russia,9,194,Winter,1906
move into brest with the fleet in picardie and set yourself to threeway draw and well have it,1,True,4,russia,germany,9,195,Fall,1907
sounds great man thanks for everything,1,True,-4,germany,russia,9,196,Fall,1907
hey germany  how are things going would you like to have alliance was against france,1,True,0,england,germany,9,0,Spring,1901
what‚Äôs up england things are good tgif,1,True,0,germany,england,9,1,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm not looking to commit to anyone just yet i hope that‚Äôs no trouble,1,True,0,germany,england,9,2,Spring,1901
ok do you mind if i ask how your relationship with france is,1,,0,england,germany,9,3,Spring,1901
not well formed at this point,1,True,0,germany,england,9,4,Spring,1901
have you been talking to russia much,1,True,0,germany,england,9,5,Spring,1901
not much why,1,True,0,england,germany,9,6,Spring,1901
just feeling around,1,True,0,germany,england,9,7,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm so excited to be playing this game now that things are calming down with the holidays i will have more free time,1,True,0,germany,england,9,8,Spring,1901
yea an early attack  from russia wouldn‚Äôt be fun,1,True,0,england,germany,9,9,Spring,1901
nice,1,,0,england,germany,9,10,Spring,1901
no it wouldn‚Äôt for either of us,1,True,0,germany,england,9,11,Spring,1901
hey germany what are you thinking about an alliance we cant wait forever also what about belgium im assuming we both want it and a bounce would not be good as it would mean nothing for both of us,0,True,0,england,germany,9,12,Fall,1901
if you agree to attacking france i would be willing to let you have holland and belgium i would launch a fullon russia attack with yorkshire to norway and nwg to bar denmark would be left empty for that year and then you or me depending on the situation could get it in 1902 what do you think,0,True,0,england,germany,9,13,Fall,1901
because your only going to be able to have 2 of belgium denmark or holland this year,1,True,0,england,germany,9,14,Fall,1901
hmm i‚Äôm not willing to give up denmark thats a quick pick up for me,1,True,0,germany,england,9,15,Fall,1901
i would however be down to work together in exchange for passage into belgium this turn and holland next turn with one of my new units,1,True,0,germany,england,9,16,Fall,1901
i mean its up to you but both belgium and holland are easy pick ups to,1,True,0,england,germany,9,17,Fall,1901
yeah it‚Äôs true,1,True,0,germany,england,9,18,Fall,1901
how about i stay neutral for a turn or two i don‚Äôt want to wed myself to an alliance just yet but i would be down to decline any offers from france to turn on you i can‚Äôt stay neutral for very long but i think i can get through a few turns,1,True,0,germany,england,9,19,Fall,1901
wait your saying that in order to work with you i need to give you belgium and holland do you realize how ridiculous that is france wants an alliance with me too you know and while i would rather work with you if your going to make demands like that,1,,0,england,germany,9,20,Fall,1901
ehh no net really saying that‚Äôs a necessary condition lol,1,True,0,germany,england,9,21,Fall,1901
but of course i would like them,1,True,0,germany,england,9,22,Fall,1901
obviously france is reaching out to me too,1,False,0,germany,england,9,23,Fall,1901
i want to communicate with you because there are 3 centers up for grabs here and 3 units to get them now if we bounce its mutually bad but if we can communicate we can end up getting all of them because i really dont want to see a strong russia and i think they are an easy target for england i would really like to attack them im planning on moving to nwy and bar and offering you both holland and belgium as long as you dont move to denmark this turn,0,True,0,england,germany,9,24,Fall,1901
if your not interested than which centers would you like,1,,0,england,germany,9,25,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm open to it what‚Äôs the rational for me staying out of denmark though just curious,1,True,0,germany,england,9,26,Fall,1901
im not saying you shouldnt move there as that is typically a german center im fine with you moving there later its just you wouldnt be able to get there this turn if you take holland and belgium,1,True,0,england,germany,9,27,Fall,1901
i see do you see an issue with me taking denmark now and holland later,1,True,0,germany,england,9,28,Fall,1901
you could i think it would be better to get holland now and denmark later though since that would put more pressure on france and would also be more defensively sound,0,True,0,england,germany,9,29,Fall,1901
that makes sense my view is that with you and russia fighting it out over scandinavia i‚Äôm a little more worried about protecting myself there,1,,0,germany,england,9,30,Fall,1901
i hope you don‚Äôt mind if i go through with denmark,1,True,0,germany,england,9,31,Fall,1901
okay,1,True,0,england,germany,9,32,Fall,1901
i also think the move to belgium puts pressure on france,1,True,0,germany,england,9,33,Fall,1901
germany doesn‚Äôt have to disband,1,False,-1,england,germany,9,34,Winter,1902
wrong person lol,1,False,-1,england,germany,9,35,Winter,1902
how‚Äôs it going turkey looking forward to a fun and exciting game,1,True,0,germany,turkey,9,0,Spring,1901
its going good,1,False,0,turkey,germany,9,1,Spring,1901
that‚Äôs great i‚Äôm so excited for this game,1,True,0,germany,turkey,9,2,Spring,1901
greetings germany  the risk of an early conflict between france and germany is pretty high so suggest that we clear the air early on  the biggest question here is burgundy which borders one of your home supply centers and two of mine it is important to me that burgundy remains unoccupied  my suggestion is that we set up a bounce between a munich  burgundy a paris  burgundy this has the secondary benefit of allowing us to put on some theater about how the other broke their word to win sympathy points i also believe that germany often wants a munich to stay put anyways to guard against an attack through tyrolia  let me also know your thoughts regarding belgium i am not super attached to claiming it so would be open to bargain my support on the belgian question for a future alliance  best of luck to you,1,True,0,france,germany,9,0,Spring,1901
hi france thanks for taking the initiative and for your thoughtful message let‚Äôs do the bounce in burgundy i‚Äôm really looking forward to getting to know you and everyone in this game,1,True,0,germany,france,9,1,Spring,1901
appreciated what are your thoughts on f kiel to denmark vs netherlands assuming berlin to kiel is a typical no brainer,1,True,0,france,germany,9,2,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm going to hol if that‚Äôs alright with you i‚Äôm very interested in your idea of giving me free pass into belgium for an alliance against england,1,True,0,germany,france,9,3,Spring,1901
i would have preferred a move to denmark but holland isnt a problem for me either  its up to you,1,True,0,france,germany,9,4,Fall,1901
are you aiming to claim belgium in year 1 as it is theres no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize,1,True,0,france,germany,9,5,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm down to do into bel it you feel comfortable with it,1,True,0,germany,france,9,6,Fall,1901
id personally prefer that you take denmark and holland than belgium but i wont stop you if youre set on belgium,1,True,0,france,germany,9,7,Fall,1901
actually just spoke to england and changed my mind i think it makes more sense for you to go to belgium,1,False,0,france,germany,9,8,Fall,1901
why what did england tell you,1,True,0,germany,france,9,9,Fall,1901
what is your relationship with france like,1,True,0,germany,france,9,10,Winter,1901
sorry typo i meant to say england lol,0,True,0,germany,france,9,11,Winter,1901
england hasnt been very talkative with me but our conversation has been pretty cordial,1,True,0,france,germany,9,12,Winter,1901
anyways what are your thoughts in terms of builds f kiel is a near given if you want to seize holland,1,True,0,france,germany,9,13,Winter,1901
gotcha i‚Äôm pretty unnerved by the holland move that wasn‚Äôt planned i told him i wanted to stay nutreal between the two of you as long as i can,1,True,0,germany,france,9,14,Winter,1901
yeah i‚Äôm thinking f kiel a ber,1,True,0,germany,france,9,15,Winter,1901
taking belgium so that you could easily fill holland later seems a bit aggressive for someone wishing to stay neutral,1,True,0,france,germany,9,16,Winter,1901
yeah that was not the move in retrospect,1,True,0,germany,france,9,17,Winter,1901
got too big for my bridges,1,True,0,germany,france,9,18,Winter,1901
still even if that his reasoning it seems like a very bold move by england,1,True,0,france,germany,9,19,Winter,1901
yeah it makes me uncomfortable,1,True,0,germany,france,9,20,Winter,1901
well things could be a lot worse if russia had convoyed a livonia to sweden they could occupy the baltic,1,True,0,france,germany,9,21,Winter,1901
curious to see what england will build though,1,True,0,france,germany,9,22,Winter,1901
me too,1,True,0,germany,france,9,23,Winter,1901
it will be very telling,1,True,0,germany,france,9,24,Winter,1901
i‚Äôm definitely interested in working out a peace on our front so i can focus on battening down the hatches from the english attack,1,True,0,germany,france,9,25,Winter,1901
im always happy to listen to offers what were you thinking,1,True,0,france,germany,9,26,Winter,1901
i mean i‚Äôm pretty much at your deposal,1,True,0,germany,france,9,27,Winter,1901
literally i‚Äôm really annoyed that england moved into holland and so i‚Äôm down to organize a sea lion on your terms,1,True,0,germany,france,9,28,Winter,1901
my fleet in brest will hopefully pressure england into moving to the channel meaning that you might be able to take holland with belgium and kiel,1,True,0,france,germany,9,29,Spring,1902
can then backfill with a kiel and aim to get your fleets at sea to convoy a denmark out,1,True,0,france,germany,9,30,Spring,1902
would want to see a munich go east instead of continuing to bounce in burgundy as well,1,True,0,france,germany,9,31,Spring,1902
let me know your thoughts on these,1,True,0,france,germany,9,32,Spring,1902
put some more thought into it and i think my earlier suggestion is stupid please ignore it  i think we will need to gauge whether russia will move against england to that end suggest that f kiel move to heligoland while a munich supports a berlin to kiel,1,True,0,france,germany,9,33,Spring,1902
we can then see if russia attacks norway before taking first steps,1,True,0,france,germany,9,34,Spring,1902
my sense is that russia is looking to move against england,1,True,0,germany,france,9,35,Spring,1902
current orders f bel h a den h a ber  kie f kie  hel a mun s ber  kie,1,True,0,germany,france,9,36,Spring,1902
got it makes sense,1,True,0,france,germany,9,37,Spring,1902
hey france  can you explain your burgundy move to me it‚Äôs really hard for me not to read your moveset as you and england teaming up against me,1,True,0,germany,france,9,38,Fall,1902
ill be blunt  i think its very difficult for france to work with germany while germany holds belgium theres simply nowhere else that french armies can go,1,True,0,france,germany,9,39,Fall,1902
with the moves i suggested to you you should be well placed to seize holland while i take belgium this would then put us in place to evict england from the north sea and convoy out,1,True,0,france,germany,9,40,Fall,1902
if you are interested in working together you should order a kiel  f heligoland support f belgium  holland or else use f heligoland and f belgium to attack the north sea in my view yielding belgium is a precondition to further cooperation,1,True,0,france,germany,9,41,Fall,1902
makes sense i got a little overambitious on the belgium play and am open to yielding it to you,1,True,0,germany,france,9,42,Fall,1902
my fear is that you will work with england to attack mun,1,True,0,germany,france,9,43,Fall,1902
it would be an extremely risky proposition for  me since a ruhr is likely to have its support cut,1,True,0,france,germany,9,44,Fall,1902
a burgundy s a ruhr  munich is more likely to succeed but i dont see whats in it for me,1,True,0,france,germany,9,45,Fall,1902
okay so my attempt to attack you went nowhere,1,,0,france,germany,9,46,Spring,1903
would you be willing to bury the hatchet and focus on england,1,,0,france,germany,9,47,Spring,1903
not asking you to trust me on this before i demonstrate my seriousness,1,,0,france,germany,9,48,Spring,1903
but assuming i go to the channel would you be willing to follow with an attack on nth,1,,0,france,germany,9,49,Spring,1903
i am very very on board,1,True,0,germany,france,9,50,Spring,1903
let me look at it i‚Äôm out right now but i am very interested in that move,1,True,0,germany,france,9,51,Spring,1903
right ive already asked russia about this they should be on board,1,True,0,france,germany,9,52,Spring,1903
my suggestion is f pic  eng a bit  pic f hol  f nwy s f hel  nth a kie s f hol h,1,True,0,france,germany,9,53,Spring,1903
let me know your thoughts but keep in mind that its getting late in central europe time so i might not be able to change the orders before the deadline if you suggest revisions,1,True,0,france,germany,9,54,Spring,1903
what are your planned moves,1,True,0,germany,france,9,55,Spring,1903
what is russia thinking of doing,1,True,0,germany,france,9,56,Spring,1903
i think russia is on board with those moves,1,True,0,france,germany,9,57,Spring,1903
apologies i didnt see these because i forgot to rate some earlier messages,1,,0,france,germany,9,58,Winter,1903
we need to do something about russia though  they are now twice the size of the next biggest power,1,,0,france,germany,9,59,Winter,1903
i can withdraw from burgundy if that would ease cooperation,1,,0,france,germany,9,60,Winter,1903
yeah withdraw if you like,1,True,0,germany,france,9,61,Spring,1904
what are you thinking with russia,1,True,0,germany,france,9,62,Spring,1904
russia is on track to winning i think we need to out in a united front to contain them,1,,0,france,germany,9,63,Spring,1904
if denmark and nth hit norway and sweden while hol backfills to nth that would put a lot of pressure on them,1,,0,france,germany,9,64,Spring,1904
munich could also go to silesia while ruhr fills into munich,1,,0,france,germany,9,65,Spring,1904
russia is well on their way to winning  we need to put up a united front against them if we want to have a shot,1,,0,france,germany,9,66,Fall,1904
are you in,1,,0,france,germany,9,67,Fall,1904
as im sure you know turkey is a potential threat to us both id like to talk to you about possibly curtailing that threat,1,True,1,russia,austria,9,0,Spring,1901
i cant be online but i am open to hearing your ideas,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,1,Spring,1901
 online too much longer is what i meant to type,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,2,Spring,1901
well the ideas mostly consist of cooperating to take them down you me and the italians im going to be moving from warsaw to ukraine to take romania and im going to be bouncing them in the black sea,1,True,1,russia,austria,9,3,Spring,1901
so i am open to working with you but i would like to see you leave gal as a neutral territory and i will as well,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,4,Spring,1901
thats my intent i was going to ask you to do the same but you beat me to it,1,True,1,russia,austria,9,5,Spring,1901
sounds good  we will do that and learn that we can trust one another,1,False,-1,austria,russia,9,6,Spring,1901
excellent looking forward to working together,1,True,1,russia,austria,9,7,Spring,1901
great  enjoy your weekend and catch you in the fall season üôÇ,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,8,Spring,1901
i can use the army in rumania to support you into bulgaria this season and the turks cant stop it,1,,1,russia,austria,9,9,Spring,1902
ok ive actually made a huge planning breakthrough bear with me ive got the turks duped into thinking im on their side so im going to be supporting them to stay put in bulgaria in spring their plan is to move their fleet in constantinople to the aegean and for the plan to work its important that that succeed  in the fall im going to be convoying an army directly into constantinople because the turks are allowing me to move my fleet into the black sea well have them destroyed within the next year and then we can pivot to the french and germans,1,True,1,russia,austria,9,10,Spring,1902
so if they are letting you into the black sea then why dont you support me into  bulgaria and then i can support you into constantinople  they made a bad move in the first year so together we could take them out i believe pretty handily,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,11,Spring,1902
for several reasons if we take bulgaria this season theyre pushed back into constantinople with the possibility of three units supporting and not even close to enough units for us to push through them if we take constantinople and bulgaria simultaneously in fall we not only deprive them of an additional build we also put ourselves in the position to destroy them in the next year completely,1,False,1,russia,austria,9,12,Spring,1902
hey you cool youre making a lot of aggressive moves here i need you to chill out before you ruin the entire offensive i told you well in advance of the end of the turn that i was tricking the turks here and that wed have you in bulgaria by the end of this turn why are you doing this,1,,1,russia,austria,9,13,Fall,1902
i didnt believe you  if you really wanted to work with me there was no reason not to help me into bulgaria when i could have then leant my help in return  all you had to do was move moscow into sevestapol and your fleet into black sea and we could have been golden  when you told me you werent going to help that said to me that this is a set up  i am not sure where this leaves us but we could have been in a much stronger position,1,False,-1,austria,russia,9,14,Fall,1902
are you serious did you even read what i sent to you i told you that we were going to take constantinople and bulgaria in one fell swoop in the fall take the turks completely by surprise and have them annihilated before the next build phase if the army in bulgaria was knocked back to constantinople wed have another two years of maneuvering to knock them out ahead of us you ruined that,1,True,1,russia,austria,9,15,Fall,1902
dude look at the map  that would not work,1,False,-1,austria,russia,9,16,Fall,1902
unless he was completely stupid there is no chance that could possibly have worked,1,False,-1,austria,russia,9,17,Fall,1902
it literally did work it would have worked like a charm if you hadnt messed it up the turks trust me implicitly i could have landed in constantinople and theyd have been taken entirely by surprise because they thought i was allied to them i told you literally all of this,1,False,1,russia,austria,9,18,Fall,1902
so you were trusting him not to do that as well even with his army sittin right in arm,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,19,Fall,1902
then at best you et the territory you wanted i get nothing and at worst he takes sevestopol from you because that is what he told me he was going to do,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,20,Fall,1902
no because if that was the case they wouldnt trust me and the would defend bulgaria,1,False,-1,austria,russia,9,21,Fall,1902
sorry man ive played this too many times to know what was likely to happen in that situation,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,22,Fall,1902
his army in armenia is a feint play fighting because he didnt want you and italy to think that we were on the same side which i specifically told you was happening because i needed you to fucking trust me when for one turn i supported the turks to stay put to keep the subterfuge up i was going to build in sevastopol to prevent them coming toward me once the act fell you were going to be 21 going into bulgaria because the italians were going to cut its only possible support you were going to get bulgaria id get constantinople and the next season would see us wipe them out the rest of the way,1,,1,russia,austria,9,23,Fall,1902
again  if he is trusting you then he is not trusting me  which means you take the territory and i dont,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,24,Fall,1902
are you a fucking amateur greeceserbia outnumbers bulgaria they cant get support from the aegean because the italians were going to cut that support it was going to be a fucking walkin victory with the added bonus of forcing that army to disband because id have parachuted into constantinople,1,,1,russia,austria,9,25,Fall,1902
i have the turks practically taking marching orders from me this was going to be the perfect offensive until you decided to go off script,1,,1,russia,austria,9,26,Fall,1902
whatever it doesnt matter we can get back on track the turks are going to go wholehog on greece youll have to support it to keep it remove yourself from galicia away from my territory regain my trust and well restart from where we were spring this year if you dont then youve got quite the situation on your hands one that austria never wins,1,,1,russia,austria,9,27,Fall,1902
the only way he can take greece is with your help,1,False,-1,austria,russia,9,28,Fall,1902
which means why would i trust you and leave galicia,1,False,-1,austria,russia,9,29,Fall,1902
there needs to be some sort of trade that might make things believeable between the 2 of us,1,False,-1,austria,russia,9,30,Fall,1902
hes assuming that youre going to use all your support on attacking rumania and that italys going to make another play for the eastern med obviously in fact its not even possible for me to anything more than tangentially involved and thats assuming that you were going to use your support from serbia toward greece anyways im just telling you what he told me if you want to criticize his tactics talk to him   whats this trade youre proposing,0,True,1,russia,austria,9,31,Fall,1902
quite frankly since youre the one doing the betraying and i have thusfar told you literally nothing but the truth and tried to help you i feel absolutely no need to give you much but im curious about your proposal anyways,0,True,1,russia,austria,9,32,Fall,1902
no proposal then,1,True,1,russia,austria,9,33,Fall,1902
i was not home for the night,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,34,Fall,1902
ah i see,1,True,1,russia,austria,9,35,Fall,1902
well i am going to watch the caps hockey game  i will be back after to see what you have to say but any suggestion will have to go along with you trusting me to leave my army in gal  in exchange you would have to help me somehow and if the trust holds then next year i could move out of gal  anyhow i will be back on probably around 1030p,1,False,-1,austria,russia,9,36,Fall,1902
out watching the caps vs bruins game with some friends,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,37,Fall,1902
anyhow  my suggestion was going to be i stay in gal for a turn and you support me into bulgaria with rum  that still allows you to also take one of turkeys territories if he still trusts you  if that happens i move out of gal next turn renewing the safe border and then we finish off turkey,1,False,-1,austria,russia,9,38,Fall,1902
we can still accomplish the same thing,1,False,-1,austria,russia,9,39,Fall,1902
im honestly not sure how we trust each other right now it would be a leap on both our parts,1,False,-1,austria,russia,9,40,Fall,1902
what are your thoughts  i need to make moves and get some sleep,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,41,Fall,1902
ill check messages in the morning before i make moves  i need to get some sleep  until later,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,42,Fall,1902
no i did nothing to break your trust you move out of galicia or i wont deal with you we made an agreement i told you in advance of all my plans and you raised only minimal objections before deciding to make moves to betray me   i wont be coerced into allowing you to break our very first agreement just because you didnt think hard enough about what i told you to see how it would work,1,True,1,russia,austria,9,43,Fall,1902
i wrote that since it didnt seem like you were responding,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,44,Fall,1902

ah well  i didnt get to edit my orders either,1,True,-1,austria,russia,9,49,Fall,1902

hey i can get the italians to back off of tyrolia if you disband the fleet in the adriatic instead of the one in albania they need to fight the french off and their move into greece and tyrolia was something that was going to be called off if last nights adjudication hadnt happened so damn fast,1,False,3,russia,austria,9,54,Winter,1902
hey austria just dropping in to say hello our paths probably won‚Äôt cross for a while but may i suggest you attack russia i think an austriaturkey alliance would work well since i‚Äôve seen way to many games where russia is left to their own devices and all of the sudden have half the board anyways good luck and have fun,1,True,0,england,austria,9,0,Spring,1901
i wish you luck as well  perhaps we can work together further into the game,1,True,0,austria,england,9,1,Spring,1901
so what are you thinking about russia i would hate to see them run off with the game this early on especially because turkey doesnt seem like the most competent player,1,True,0,england,austria,9,2,Spring,1902
i am honestly undecided  russia had a nice first turn but we also agreed on a good neutral territory and that promise was kept so i like people who are trustworthy,1,True,0,austria,england,9,3,Spring,1902
hey there neighbor,1,True,0,turkey,austria,9,0,Spring,1901
thoughts on how we want to split the balkans,1,True,0,turkey,austria,9,1,Spring,1901
hello there yourself,1,True,0,austria,turkey,9,2,Spring,1901
what are your thoughts  i havent spoken to anyone else yet so i am open to ideas before that  we would most certainly need to deal with russia sooner rather than later,1,True,0,austria,turkey,9,3,Spring,1901
agreed  id rather deal with russia from the get go as well have you heard anything from italy tho im kind of worried of committing north if theyre an unknown quantity,1,True,0,turkey,austria,9,4,Spring,1901
all i have heard from italy thus far is they dont want to fight so hopefully that is the case,1,True,0,austria,turkey,9,5,Spring,1901
yea hopefully  my hands are kinda tied until they commit somewhere tho so ill probably be playing pretty neutral too,0,,0,turkey,austria,9,6,Spring,1901
italy also mentioned they were interested in going for greece so might be best to go there with support just in case ya,1,True,0,turkey,austria,9,7,Fall,1901
i appreciate the heads up  why didnt you move your army in smyr up,1,True,0,austria,turkey,9,8,Fall,1901
this setup is better for fending off italy if they come my way and i also have the option of going to arm this turn,1,,0,turkey,austria,9,9,Fall,1901
so whats the plan now,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,9,10,Spring,1902
i am not sure things are certainly a lot tighter  and it is more difficult since you didnt move your army up earlier what ideas do you have,1,True,1,austria,turkey,9,11,Spring,1902
hey havent heard from you i would like to make some plans for movement,1,True,1,austria,turkey,9,12,Spring,1902
sorry your messages just came though for some reason,1,True,-1,turkey,austria,9,13,Spring,1902
we could coordinate an attack on rum while i deploy my fleets towards italy perhaps,0,True,-1,turkey,austria,9,14,Spring,1902
just so you know i think we should be working against russia  apparently you let him know that you would let him into the black sea which he is talking to me about taking advantage of if you help me into rum we should be able to get you into sevestapol in the fall,1,True,1,austria,turkey,9,15,Spring,1902
i agree  i figured getting into sev could be easier if he thinks he can move his fleet,0,True,-1,turkey,austria,9,16,Spring,1902
i currently have my orders supporting ser unless you want to go with bud instead,0,True,-1,turkey,austria,9,17,Spring,1902
i told russia i would help him take con in fall if he helps me take bulgaria in spring,1,True,1,austria,turkey,9,18,Spring,1902
i think that would work right,1,True,1,austria,turkey,9,19,Spring,1902
if you move fleet smy into con and con into ank i think he would be able to stop us from getting you into sevastapol,1,True,1,austria,turkey,9,20,Spring,1902
i would prefer budapest,1,True,1,austria,turkey,9,21,Spring,1902
if he believes me then that could work really well for us,1,True,1,austria,turkey,9,22,Spring,1902
alright sounds like a plan then,0,True,-1,turkey,austria,9,23,Spring,1902
cool  i think this could work out really well,1,True,1,austria,turkey,9,24,Spring,1902
sorry i had to lead you along like that  i wasnt sure if youd go along with this plan but now russia trusts me so we can definitely get into rum and sev and they wont have time to retaliate with the fleet in bla,0,True,-1,turkey,austria,9,25,Fall,1902
dude i dont think you get how this works  there is zero reason for me to trust you now and you gave up a great opportunity to hurt a difficult to deal with country  plus you gave up the black sea which lets him threaten con and ank,1,True,1,austria,turkey,9,26,Fall,1902
one thing i will say is you can probably take sevestapol if you want it i think he trusts you pretty much completely  i dont know his plans now but before this past turn his entire plans was to work with me to take you out so i would be warry that he we take territory from you,1,True,1,austria,turkey,9,27,Fall,1902
i am a bit new at this stuff sorry,0,True,-1,turkey,austria,9,28,Fall,1902
greetings austria  we dont have any immediate discussion points but thought i would check in with you since it can be dangerous for me if austria collapses early and that is a serious risk if austria is a newbie not sure if you are  suggest that you get germany on your side early they will be dangerously exposed if you struggle early you should ask them to send f kiel  denmark with the message to russia that if he attacks you with a warsaw  galicia instead of ukraine he will block them out of sweden  good luck and have fun,1,True,0,france,austria,9,0,Spring,1901
greetings to you as well  i wish you luck and i will certainly keep all of that in mind,1,True,0,austria,france,9,1,Spring,1901
seems like year one went well for you have both greece and serbia in the bag how are your feelings on italy,1,True,0,france,austria,9,2,Fall,1901
i am friendly with them thus far  i am open to discussion in general about how we might be able to work together,1,True,0,austria,france,9,3,Fall,1901
haha im sure turkey would be very alarmed to hear that,1,True,0,france,austria,9,4,Winter,1901
still though you seem well placed,1,True,0,france,austria,9,5,Winter,1901
well i started off friendly with both of them  havent exactly figured out what i am going to do yet as i am still waiting to hear from both of them at the moment  what is your relationship with italy like at the moment,1,True,0,austria,france,9,6,Spring,1902
theres been some tension as italy is concerned about my presence in the mediterranean however it seems to be mostly defused i would prefer to keep things cordial for now,1,False,0,france,austria,9,7,Spring,1902
if you would be interested in a joint attack i might change my mind and join but i am also happy to stand by if you see them as an ally,1,True,0,france,austria,9,8,Fall,1902
lets see where things lie at the end of this year,1,True,0,austria,france,9,9,Fall,1902
sure thats reasonable i think it will be an interesting year,1,,0,france,austria,9,10,Fall,1902
okay italy predicted my move to tuscany but yyouve been stabbed by italy as well,1,True,1,france,austria,9,11,Winter,1902
theyll probably build in venetia and try to hit trieste,1,True,1,france,austria,9,12,Winter,1902
would you be willing to support me into venice,1,True,1,france,austria,9,13,Winter,1902
probably  i messed up big time with some crappy communication and then last minute moves  i think i much prefer playing this game in person then over the computer,1,True,-1,austria,france,9,14,Spring,1903
the dynamic is definitely very different  typically misorders are rarer playing on line  which also makes them costlier,1,,1,france,austria,9,15,Spring,1903
hey russia looking forward to a great game üôÉ i think we should discuss scandinavia üòâ and how to split it up i‚Äôm not interested in attacking you at least for a while hopefully you feel the same way anyways good luck and have fun,0,False,-1,england,russia,9,0,Spring,1901
always good to discuss things in advance to avoid unnecessary nonsense im not particularly interested in norway so long as youre not interested in sweden,1,True,1,russia,england,9,1,Spring,1901
sounds good,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,2,Spring,1901

thats asking a whole lot considering how the britainrussia paradigm often ends,1,True,1,russia,england,9,7,Winter,1901
i would like to focus all my attention on germany which could leave me a bit exposed you don‚Äôt seem to be meeting all to much resistance over there and i really don‚Äôt want to be attacked from you i am not interested in attacking you as i have my hands full with germany and making sure france doesn‚Äôt turn,0,True,-1,england,russia,9,8,Winter,1901
i definitely understand that and i trust you but its better to trust and also verify,0,True,1,russia,england,9,9,Winter,1901
verify how,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,10,Winter,1901
by making it harder for you to simply walk into st petersburg with no consequences if you chose to do that,1,True,1,russia,england,9,11,Winter,1901
do you think perhaps the french intended to build the opposite things in opposite places it seems an odd choice to do what they did there,1,True,1,russia,england,9,12,Spring,1902
agreed,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,13,Spring,1902
either that or theyre up to something very squirrely,1,True,1,russia,england,9,14,Spring,1902
this turns going to be quite a weird one isnt it,1,True,1,russia,england,9,15,Fall,1902
i suppose any way i can persuade you to give me my supply center back,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,16,Fall,1902
considering you tried to land an army clearly aiming to overpower first st petersburg and then sweden and so on and so forth i would rather not if im honest it pains me to see that i guessed correctly that youd try to launch an offensive but im not fool enough to step aside and let it happen now that i know no offense  you could likely walk into belgium though considering the germans and french have talked partly through me which was weird tbh and agreed that the germans will walk out and the french will occupy it with a single unit you could overpower that easily i doubt thats part of your plan though all things considered,1,True,1,russia,england,9,17,Fall,1902
you sure france said they were going to support themselves in and so far they have been 100 honest with me i totally understand you not giving me norway back i would probably do the same but what if i did something for you in return i could support you into denmark frankly i would rather you have it then them this would be of course provided you give me norway back,0,True,-1,england,russia,9,18,Fall,1902
im just telling you what they told me dawg  and im afraid that for defensive purposes relinquishing norway at this point isnt really an option i can assist you in taking denmark and possibly kiel so long as i get berlin but norway is too vital id need you to get out of the barents first of course,1,True,1,russia,england,9,19,Fall,1902
if i keep attacking norway its really going to gridlock you,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,20,Fall,1902
if i keep talking to the french and they see you bouncing off of norway season after season do you think they might start seeing my point of view,1,,1,russia,england,9,21,Fall,1902
i dont want to its bad for me too especially if what you said is true im going to lose two centers this turn,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,22,Fall,1902
id prefer to take that army elsewhere neither of us gains much of anything by being enemies but the more time passes with your fleets so far away from liverpool the more the french might see you as an easy target if you have to deconstruct two units this turn youd have a hard time stopping them too thats just my personal take though,1,True,1,russia,england,9,23,Fall,1902
no im worried about france too why do you care about how well i do,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,24,Fall,1902
lol france is asking for me to support into munich and belgium leaving me at 3 them at 7 and liverpool exposed,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,25,Fall,1902
id rather have more troops in the south things are getting weird i also think that france is using you every time i talk to them theyre very lukewarm on the topic of you furthermore with them fighting the germans and soon to be the italians theyd be an easy target if you moved fast enough i think if you talked to the germans theyd be more than willing to discuss,1,True,1,russia,england,9,26,Fall,1902
also lmao thatd be a disgustingly arrogant deal for them to offer i almost dont believe you,1,True,1,russia,england,9,27,Fall,1902
i stabbed germany with holland they dont liketrust me i do get the sense france is trying to use me,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,28,Fall,1902
no im serious i tried explaining how stupid that was to them and they were like munich is really importand for france and from there i could support you into kielberlin,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,29,Fall,1902
i think that if you earnestly offered and proved your willingness to work with the germans by pulling off of them for a season that theyd be all too willing to pivot to the french personally,1,True,1,russia,england,9,30,Fall,1902
thats a set up to build a fleet in brest to pick you off solo i can almost guarantee it,1,True,1,russia,england,9,31,Fall,1902
or its just russia trying to persuade enland to attack france who he doesnt want to see becoming to powerfull üòâ,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,32,Fall,1902
lol im allowed to have ulterior motives arent i i admit that that would be a good outcome but just speaking honestly and frankly you have no chance of stopping a french solo if all goes wrong for you this turn how long will it take before they see you as liability that they cant afford im just offering options aside from that because tbh thats always a depressing outcome for the english,1,True,1,russia,england,9,33,Fall,1902
the entente is a powerful alliance for france but its never more than a silver medal for the english,1,,1,russia,england,9,34,Fall,1902

if youre being honest your fleet has nothing to do in the barents anyways,1,,1,russia,england,9,38,Fall,1902

i really need supply centers let me talk to france and germany and ill let you know in a bit what the plan is,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,43,Fall,1902
if barents is gone nwy isnt a threat in fact i am a bit worried that you wont hold your word and even if you do nwy will be easy for you to get with sweden and stp,1,False,-1,england,russia,9,44,Fall,1902
if barents is gone its 3 v 3 and i wouldnt be able to get back in if i wanted to youd still have the north sea and norwegian sea,1,,1,russia,england,9,45,Fall,1902
well barring the germans but theyre about to lose 2 supply centers so not much to fear there,0,,1,russia,england,9,46,Fall,1902

moscow warsaw and sevastapol are all further south than stp,1,True,-1,england,russia,9,57,Fall,1902

üëç,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,9,13,Spring,1901
would you be ok holding sev this turn so i can start to send my fleet towards the mediterranean,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,9,14,Fall,1901
if so one idea we could go for if we want to simulate conflict between us is i move to rum and you support yourself in so it looks like i was trying to bounce you,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,9,15,Fall,1901
hopefully then you can get austria to trust you and leave themselves vulnerable,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,9,16,Fall,1901
can do and also i very much like that idea keeps them from catching on too early,1,True,1,russia,turkey,9,17,Fall,1901
great sounds like a plan then,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,9,18,Fall,1901
ill probably be sending my other army to syria then so i can build a fleet in smy and start moving west,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,9,19,Fall,1901
unless you think it should go to armenia for extra play action,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,9,20,Fall,1901
armenia makes it harder to be in position when the fighting starts if you ask me from syria you can easily convoy out but either way works for me,0,True,1,russia,turkey,9,21,Fall,1901
mm thats fair yea  ill think it over and get back to you on that then,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,9,22,Fall,1901
ok so heres what im thinking im pretty suspicious of a lepanto coming from italyaustria so i dont think ill really have the opportunity to convoy in the immediate future that being said i think we can still make good progress if we can catch austria by surprise with our alliance so id say its more important to prioritize the fake aggression and then in the spring the army can fall back to syriasmyrna to block up a lepanto if it comes to that,1,True,-1,turkey,russia,9,23,Fall,1901
that scans to me yeah it certainly is shaping up to be a pretty standard lepanto right now,1,True,1,russia,turkey,9,24,Fall,1901
whats the plan for spring do we spring the trap now,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,25,Spring,1902
i think we probably should  do we want to attack ser right away or just focus on holding what we have while we bring our other units into position,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,26,Spring,1902
attacking serbia without support moving into bulgaria risks leaving it empty with an enemy fleet in the aegean if the austrians attack with the fleet in greece and would likely just bounce if they tried to attack with the army in serbia maybe wait a turn to get fleets into better positions,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,27,Spring,1902
alrighty id be on board with that,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,28,Spring,1902
would it be possible to get your support in holding onto bul then or do you think we should keep up our pretending if possible id like to be able to move my fleet to aeg,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,29,Spring,1902
i can do that yeah things would be easier and more fluid defensively if i moved into the black sea but i get if that would be trusting me a little farther than youre willing to,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,30,Spring,1902
i was just about to suggest that myself actually  tho the support in bul would still be appreciated for this turn,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,31,Spring,1902
alright just didnt want to overstep the lines you know how it is i can probably even use it to keep up the subterfuge even with supporting you since it would be really easy to misclick supporting bulgaria to stay put rather than supporting serbia to bulgaria,0,True,2,russia,turkey,9,32,Spring,1902
do you think youll move both fleets out or support one into the aegean,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,33,Spring,1902
i was thinking of moving both out but im not 100 decided yet,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,34,Spring,1902
well a standard lapanto requires that italy move into eastern mediterranean so at worst if the austrians try to move into the aegean youd have both bounced i can talk to both of them and ensure that the austrians dont do that though so you can bounce the italians and succeed at moving into the aegean,0,True,2,russia,turkey,9,35,Spring,1902
that would be the ideal if you supported into the aegean the italians would succeed at moving into the eastern med and then youd have problems,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,36,Spring,1902
thats what i was hoping for yea  though im also not really sure whats up with the austrian fleet build,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,37,Spring,1902
yeah the italians are on edge about that as well the austrians are opaque though since they only speak in a single 10 minute period on any given day,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,38,Spring,1902
aint that the truth rip lol,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,39,Spring,1902
hey i think i can get the italians on our side against austria are you willing to let them have greece,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,40,Fall,1902
id be ok with it in the short term maybe but if they get too big itll be kinda hard for me to make any sorta progress in the med ya,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,41,Fall,1902
yeah obviously its temporary but in the short term having them on our side helps us speed austrias demise significantly and their position will be absurdly weak,0,True,2,russia,turkey,9,42,Fall,1902
thanks for the backup in rumania btw didnt suspect that the austrians would catch on before wed gotten started ill likely need that support again im afraid,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,43,Fall,1902
alright thats fair yea and especially with france in the west we should be ok to take out italy after,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,44,Fall,1902
yeah so the usefulness of getting italy greece is significant since it gets them a build to use on austrias second front and puts more friendly units on our very own front line i take it you and they have started speaking,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,45,Fall,1902
yep,0,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,46,Fall,1902
good good well have the austrians on the ropes by the end of next year hopefully,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,47,Fall,1902
üëç,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,48,Fall,1902
btw im feeding austria a heaping helping of bullshit right now to try and get them to back up off of me so that i can be in better position to attack just in case they try to snitch and show you the bullshit im telling them im still playing them as if im their friend who wants to regain their trust and attack you,1,,2,russia,turkey,9,49,Fall,1902
but yeah just to be clear before nightfall youre going to support an italian convoy to greece right just want to make sure that things dont go wrong for want of communication,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,50,Fall,1902
yea thats the plan,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,51,Fall,1902
just to be clear youre also supporting bul right,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,52,Fall,1902
of course if austria got squirrely and took bulgaria itd be a disaster for both of us,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,53,Fall,1902
i could also have rumania support an attack on bulgaria to cut support if he sees an attack coming from there and even possibly take it if you like but that has some risks attached i think,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,54,Fall,1902
an attack on serbia sorry,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,55,Fall,1902
yea greece just retreats to bul then and it gets messy for me,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,56,Fall,1902
oh yeah they would wouldnt they i didnt even think of the retreat tbh ill support you to hold then,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,57,Fall,1902
if you want to get fancy we could both tap ser and with tun hitting greece bul would be safe  that does put rum at risk tho so its a bit dicey,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,58,Fall,1902
yeah id rather keep rumania in place just in case the austrians decide to throw all their force behind it,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,59,Fall,1902
alright thats fair just putting the option out there,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,60,Fall,1902
yeah so then weve got black sea and bulgaria supporting rumania then possibly ukraine if the italians get austria to tell them their plans and it turns out that they intends to throw all of their forces behind an attack there,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,61,Fall,1902
depending on what the italians can tell us we might also need bla to support bul in case bud taps rum but pretty much that yea,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,62,Fall,1902
of course the intelligence we get defines our strategy i just hope that the austrians didnt go afk for the rest of the night until the orders hit like they normally do,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,63,Fall,1902
speaking of going afk i have to go take a final exam now but im pretty sure my orders are set anyways ,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,64,Fall,1902
unless the italians deliver something earth shattering i think so yes good luck on your test,1,True,2,russia,turkey,9,65,Fall,1902
thanks p,1,True,-2,turkey,russia,9,66,Fall,1902
are you alright if i build an army in sevastopol,1,True,3,russia,turkey,9,67,Winter,1902
id rather see it in moscow to be honest but if you feel like its necessary i wont object too much,1,True,-3,turkey,russia,9,68,Winter,1902
i just want to keep the austrians guessing about what i intend to do with that plus i already convinced them again that im on their side despite having supported you for two turns now so it might be important to speed things up to keep up the pretense that i might think about going toward you keep them confused yknow,1,True,3,russia,turkey,9,69,Winter,1902
alright thats fair just as long as theyre the one getting tricked p,1,True,-3,turkey,russia,9,70,Winter,1902
think the italians and i are supporting you into serbia first turn and then me to budapest the second that scan as far as what you know,1,True,3,russia,turkey,9,71,Winter,1902
that sounds like what the italians proposed to me yea,1,True,-3,turkey,russia,9,72,Winter,1902
excellent thatll leave the austrians on the ropes we can think about moving on the italians after that depending on the situation,1,True,3,russia,turkey,9,73,Winter,1902
sorry for the deception  i only decided at the last minute and i also didnt want any leaks getting to italy,1,False,-3,turkey,russia,9,74,Fall,1903
i understand but its not like im gonna leak to them anyways,1,True,3,russia,turkey,9,75,Fall,1903
as long as youll help galicia move into budapest i dont mind,1,True,3,russia,turkey,9,76,Fall,1903
meaning that youll poke serbia to break any possible support of course,1,True,3,russia,turkey,9,77,Fall,1903
alright will do thanks for understanding,1,True,-3,turkey,russia,9,78,Fall,1903
 oof ,1,True,-7,turkey,russia,9,79,Spring,1904
yeah sorry for what its worth i fuckin hate doing this whole betrayal thing to people its the worst part of this game ,1,True,7,russia,turkey,9,80,Spring,1904
greetings russia  we dont have too much to discuss early on but i was curious on whether or not you were planning to move a moscow  st petersburg where you could make a play for norway  and likewise was curious whether you planned to order f sevestapol  black sea or else allow turkey to occupy it  its early but we might have room to cooperate against england or germany in the future lets keep in touch good luck,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,0,Spring,1901
id be very interested in organizing a group effort against britain right now i likely wont move to saint petersburg the first turn in case the germans try something but im definitely bouncing in the black sea,1,True,1,russia,france,9,1,Spring,1901
understood whats your plan then   you might consider moscow to livonia which would still improve your situation in the north since you could convoy to sweden and then build in stp while also helping to cover warsaw  or else you could just commit both of your armies to the south,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,2,Spring,1901
ive spoken with the germans and a group effort against the british is likely im still considering various ways to secure my position better but i think keeping one army put in moscow offers the best stability for the time being if the germans are telling the truth it will likely move to secure a spot in finland in the second year,1,True,1,russia,france,9,3,Spring,1901
i would advise against staying put both ukraine and livonia can defend 34 of your centers st petersburg  cant be attacked year 1 and the risk to sevestapol is nominal in year 1 since even if he goes all out you bounce him out of black sea and he can only make an unsupported attempt from armenia,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,4,Spring,1901
going to livonia is just as good for defending against germany but gives you more options in the north,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,5,Spring,1901
perhaps youre right but an emergency is more likely to materialize in the south in the rare case that austria might deploy full strength against me and the utility of remaining in moscow in that case is much greater i prefer the overall flexibility to the ability to deploy quickly to scandinavia personally,1,True,1,russia,france,9,6,Spring,1901
if you are concerned about the worst case on defense i would order a warsaw  galicia and a moscow  ukraine,1,False,-1,france,russia,9,7,Spring,1901
the absolute worst case is  a berlin  prussia or silesia a smyrna  armenia f ankara  black sea a vienna  galicia a budapest s a vienna  galicia or  rumania,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,8,Spring,1901
even in that nightmare scenario you can defend all your centers with a ukraine s sev h if austria went to rumania or support warsaw if they went to galicia with support,1,False,-1,france,russia,9,9,Spring,1901
i have to be careful not to provoke a worst case through concern for it remaining in moscow on the first turn only marginally reduces my ability on the second turn in the north while it retains the ability to support go south quickly if all goes wrong,1,True,1,russia,france,9,10,Spring,1901
im greatly tempted to take that army to finland in any case,1,True,1,russia,france,9,11,Spring,1901
have you talked to italy even if youre not going for an austrian offensive they could provide a hedge against an eastward move by austria you can also deny working together in the event that austria is offended by this,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,12,Spring,1901
the italians have been relatively tight lipped they havent spoken much more than the austrians and the austrians havent spoken at all which is concerning to say the least,0,True,1,russia,france,9,13,Spring,1901
thats interesting in my experience with italy russia is the one country you can rely on since theyre a potential ally against either austria or turkey its strange that they havent been recruiting your alliance,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,14,Spring,1901
i havent heard from austria either theyre the one player i havent heard from,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,15,Spring,1901
well thats reassuring at least are the germans on board for a sea lion in your opinion they havent responded to my counterproposal after they requested they get norway hard to tell if they are unsatisfied or if they simply havent had time to respond,1,True,1,russia,france,9,16,Spring,1901
my conversation with germany was very brief all i know is that they agreed to a bounce on burgundy which is kind of a no brainer for them if they believe that i am going to burgundy which i am and i told them so,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,17,Spring,1901
alright they probably spoke to you in the same window of time that they did to me did you talk about which of you gets belgium,1,True,1,russia,france,9,18,Spring,1901
we did not since i am expecting to get bounced in burgundy and am not planning to enter the channel in year 1 i will likely have no say in the belgian question,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,19,Spring,1901
i am happy to let england and germany fight for it,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,20,Spring,1901
well that reinforces my wish to disallow the germans the use of norway if hes likely to get belgium then he certainly doesnt need it,1,True,1,russia,france,9,21,Spring,1901
indeed seems like a rather greedy fellow,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,22,Spring,1901
if i was less concerned about the british id not consider them as highly for alliance temporary or otherwise,1,True,1,russia,france,9,23,Spring,1901
interesting sentiment what makes you so so concerned about the british,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,24,Spring,1901
ive seen too many russias undone by british armies in st petersburg their advantage in navy can easily push you out of scandinavia and your only means to create fleets in the north of all russias existential threats theyre the worst one because theyre britains easiest target,1,True,1,russia,france,9,25,Spring,1901
at the risk of harping on the same points this is part of why i find its important to maintain a strong presence in the north,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,26,Spring,1901
with an army in st petersburg ideally and a fleet in sweden not only can you pretty comfortably keep the english out of st petersburg you have pretty good odds of evicting them from norway,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,27,Spring,1901
you could even bounce them in norway where they would end up without a build,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,28,Spring,1901
i get that i just dont see livonia as having any particular utility that moscow doesnt have aside from the ability to convoy to sweden or finland but sweden is a position better served by a fleet anyways finland though is a place built for armies but i could get there easier via st petersburg id like to bounce the brits in norway but its imperative to keep st petersburg free for the 1902 build so that i can get a fleet there,1,True,1,russia,france,9,29,Spring,1901
i do think that livonia strengthens your position in the north but its more helpful if your target enemy is germany than england it allows you to convoy into sweden in fall 1901 build in st petersburg and then use a st petersburg and a sweden to pressure norway while f gulf of bothnia goes to the baltic,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,30,Spring,1901
if you commit three units to the south or stay in moscow youll have at most one fleet and one army in the north if you go to st petersburg youll have that number at minimum and if you convoy to sweden you can realistically get to two fleets and an army,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,31,Spring,1901
i admit that the concept is warming on me it also doesnt telegraph to the british that you dont trust them,1,True,1,russia,france,9,32,Spring,1901
st petersburg is vaguely unfriendly but one which england may not feel pressured to take action on especially if they are under pressure elsewhere however they will most likely see a move to livonia as an antigerman or a defensive move than one against them,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,33,Spring,1901
true though the german perception of the move is a concern as much as i dont relish them as allies i especially dont need them as enemies,1,True,1,russia,france,9,34,Spring,1901
i personally think you can probably spin it as a defensive move but i will acknowledge that its hard to be sure when germany has been so tight lipped,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,35,Spring,1901
right i just need more communication all around me honestly ive only really come to a decisive conclusion with the turks,1,True,1,russia,france,9,36,Spring,1901
yeah other than yourself turkey and italy have been the only other powers who have been really talkative,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,37,Spring,1901
ive spoken to england and germany enough to get the key points of alignments across but not enough to build a relationship austria has been totally silent,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,38,Spring,1901
the italians have only talked to me briefly and the turks and i just about talked enough to agree to stay out of each others way and to organize a bounce in the black sea,1,True,1,russia,france,9,39,Spring,1901
thats the same level as my discussion with germany  to align to stay out of each others way,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,40,Spring,1901
maybe its a time zone issue see if they talk overnight,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,41,Spring,1901
perhaps i just hope the austrians arent deadonarrival,1,True,1,russia,france,9,42,Spring,1901
i mean if they are you are likely to be one of the beneficiaries i should be the one saying that,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,43,Spring,1901
youre right its just a much less interesting situation if i just get to walk into budapest andor vienna,1,True,1,russia,france,9,44,Spring,1901
yeah fair enough although its only marginally worse than austria just rolling over in the face of a juggernaut alliance as happens far too often,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,45,Spring,1901
thats true austria really bums people out but tbh its my favorite to play,1,True,1,russia,france,9,46,Spring,1901
the germans are really stuck on norway for some reason,1,True,1,russia,france,9,47,Spring,1901
those cheeky sons of bitches the germans had me so goddamn worried about getting bounced in sweden and they didnt even go to denmark turn one,1,True,1,russia,france,9,48,Fall,1901
sorry for not responding sooner i got a little drunk last night but yeah austria isnt the strongest country but playing austria is kind of exciting in a way seems like in this game both you and germany are in good terms with them so theyll probably be alright at least for now,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,49,Fall,1901
yeah so long as they dont make any terrible mistakes,1,,1,russia,france,9,50,Fall,1901
fixating on norway and then not even going to denmark is really strange not sure they can even get to norway any time soon their move to holland instead is a little annoying for me and england but shouldnt be the end of the world,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,51,Fall,1901
yeah i might just take norway myself not any time soon mind i need to get things relatively resolved in the south far before that,1,True,1,russia,france,9,52,Fall,1901
yeah its hard for england to set up a strong defensive position in norway and if they were in such a position theyd probably push onwards to stp so as long as you sort things out defensively you can probably evict england later,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,53,Fall,1901
the english are getting rather unorthodox arent they,1,True,1,russia,france,9,54,Winter,1901
to be fair thats partly because they successfully anticipated an unorthodox move by germany to vacate holland,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,55,Winter,1901
and you i see you decided not to convoy to sweden,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,56,Winter,1901
army wouldnt do much good up there still want to be able to pivot away if other issues arise better to potentially get the fleet out of the baltic,1,True,1,russia,france,9,57,Winter,1901
if you convoy you could get to the baltic anyways while having a sweden which pressures both denmark and norway as opposed to the passive a livonia,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,58,Winter,1901
no i mean out of the baltic the whole body of water to the skagerrak potentially,1,True,1,russia,france,9,59,Winter,1901
oh thats more interesting,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,60,Winter,1901
you would definitely need to get through england to get anywhere in that direction does that mean youre thinking of building in stp nc,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,61,Winter,1901
indeed its all a future thing though ive got no plans as yet for anything like that gotta resolve the south a bit better first and yeah im definitely building a fleet in stp nc cant afford the brits deciding that i look like an easy target,1,True,1,russia,france,9,62,Winter,1901
words to live by and i assume the second build will be an army in warsaw where do you stand regarding turkey and austria,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,63,Winter,1901
warsaws neutral ground as agreed with the germans so the second comes in moscow,1,True,1,russia,france,9,64,Winter,1901
as far as turkey and austria goes im inconclusive austria doesnt talk much but then again neither does turkey,0,True,1,russia,france,9,65,Winter,1901
i feel like if you build in moscow and already have a unit standing by in livonia you could very easily end up being very passive,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,66,Winter,1901
also i just noticed turkeys move to armenia,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,67,Winter,1901
yeah turkey and i are having a nice talk about that as much as can be but they dont seem particularly determined to come after me considering they didnt touch the black sea that definitely contributes to the south being inconclusive as i said,1,True,1,russia,france,9,68,Winter,1901
they can though at least if theyre not afraid of the austrians they would just build a fleet in ankara and support themsleves in,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,69,Winter,1901
that would be intensely concerning but i very seriously doubt that austria would be on board and even if they are i dont feel as though the italians would be interested,1,True,1,russia,france,9,70,Winter,1901
thats true i guess if you feel comfortable with austria and italy its a reasonable position,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,71,Winter,1901
right barring a worst case scenario the situation in the south is stable at least,1,True,1,russia,france,9,72,Winter,1901
but not especially looking to go on the offensive,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,73,Winter,1901
oh i will be just depends on which one ends up being more convincing in the next halfday,1,True,1,russia,france,9,74,Winter,1901
odd choice to build the fleet in brest,1,True,1,russia,france,9,75,Spring,1902
without any fleets in the north i will be too vulnerable to a potential english stab,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,76,Spring,1902
well were of the same mind on that front at the very least they certainly didnt appreciate when i did that though and i warned them in advance did you at least clear it with them,1,True,1,russia,france,9,77,Spring,1902
i warned then in advance but im not sure they saw it and they were unhappy either way,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,78,Spring,1902
however i think germanys moves have locked england and germany into conflict and im sure hell forget about it after some success on the german front,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,79,Spring,1902
i wouldnt be so sure of that if i was you the italians tell me that the english are angrily blabbing about your plans to attack italy with the forces you have in the south,1,True,1,russia,france,9,80,Spring,1902
there are no such plans time to do some damage control i guess,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,81,Spring,1902
yeah i figured it seemed fishy since if you planned to attack the italians surely youd have built another fleet in marseilles,1,True,1,russia,france,9,82,Spring,1902
you know i hate to sound like a broken clock but you could be in liverpool before the british could even do anything to stop you if you started now and were sufficiently sneaky about it,1,True,1,russia,france,9,83,Spring,1902
ill definitely take that under advisement of course it would be a lot more tempting if a foreign fleet were in the norwegian sea or something,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,84,Spring,1902
im sure the british will be sufficiently distracted with trying to keep me from being tempted to take norway and continuing the german campaign,1,True,1,russia,france,9,85,Spring,1902
any pertinent information on the british plan that you know andor are willing to give out by the way since theyre being so imaginative with your plans and all,1,True,1,russia,france,9,86,Spring,1902
nothing concrete but theyve indicated to me that they feel like they are on good terms with you which might mean that they plan to prioritize defending belgium over defending norway,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,87,Spring,1902
sorry holland,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,88,Spring,1902
excellent theyll definitely need to do that if they intend to keep that foothold and expand it,1,True,1,russia,france,9,89,Spring,1902
that does leave them vulnerable to an attack on norway however,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,90,Spring,1902
theyre either vulnerable to one or vulnerable to the other they cant have a guaranteed hold on both until fall and thats only assuming that their positioning relative to germany doesnt worsen significantly,1,True,1,russia,france,9,91,Spring,1902
yeah and the other complication is that they can only go to norwegian sea to shore up their position ,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,92,Spring,1902
indeed if they move to the helgoland bight or skagerrak to try and make room for more fleets to use against germany they risk losing netherlands and the foothold that they had established with no more means of gaining ground against the germans if they had built in london they could move to the channel to try and strongarm belgium but they built an army there instead,1,True,1,russia,france,9,93,Spring,1902
of course if they felt comfortable with you f norway could go to skagerrak to shore things up,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,94,Spring,1902
if they felt comfortable i doubt theyd have bothered to build a fleet that can go directly to the norwegian sea rather than one that can almost immediately deploy to harass andor support belgium,1,True,1,russia,france,9,95,Spring,1902
to be honest im not sure i get the a london build at all liverpool is better placed for convoying since you could go to clyde if you wanted to convoy through the north sea,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,96,Spring,1902
i understand and appreciate that if he intended to respect our demilitarization of the english channel and expected me to do the same f edinburgh is better than f london,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,97,Spring,1902
but why a london then,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,98,Spring,1902
yeah its not a terribly competent build order all things considered the fact that in one turn liverpool can move to be convoyed through any sea zone around britain means that its significantly better for that london only makes sense as a sedentary defensive move,1,True,1,russia,france,9,99,Spring,1902
im not sure it makes sense even as a defensive move in the event that i stab and go to the channel they would likely be reluctant to use a london to bounce the convoy in wales,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,100,Spring,1902
while it can obviously cover london itself in that sense it is little better than liverpool  yorkshire,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,101,Spring,1902
thats very true even in the context of pure defense it doesnt make a great deal of sense especially given the likelihood of an attack originating around liverpool and wales,1,True,1,russia,france,9,102,Spring,1902
i suspect the thought process was more on the lines of initially wanting to build a fleet in london deciding i would likely see that as an act of aggression and changing it to an army,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,103,Spring,1902
perhaps seems like an error of not enough foresight if thats the case,1,True,1,russia,france,9,104,Spring,1902
it still scans as a move to try and counter your influence or serve as a jumping off point for a surprise attack,1,True,1,russia,france,9,105,Spring,1902
even for a surprise attack f nth  eng a liverpool  york would make more sense,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,106,Spring,1902
yeah im not sure what theyre doing or if they even know what theyre doing,1,True,1,russia,france,9,107,Spring,1902
well i feel pretty vindicated in taking norway,1,True,1,russia,france,9,108,Fall,1902
indeed you should be able to hold both it and stp without much trouble now very aggressive attack by england,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,109,Fall,1902
just wish the austrians hadnt decided to ruin literally everything,1,True,1,russia,france,9,110,Fall,1902
look on the bright side turkey seems firmly in your camp now with their help austria should be easy to manage,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,111,Fall,1902
not without losses unfortunately you know it might be more easy for me to put a fleet in the norwegian sea if you didnt put so much pressure on the germans,1,True,1,russia,france,9,112,Fall,1902
what assistance would you need from germany a denmark is probably at your disposal  it can do nothing useful in the west ive discussed with germany a deal in which they take the north sea but yield belgium to me they seemed receptive but it might just be saving face  you should approach them with a similar offer,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,113,Fall,1902
you can no more help them take the north sea than they can prevent you from taking belgium i think that the deal needs to be a bit better than that,1,True,1,russia,france,9,114,Fall,1902
and i mostly just need germanys fleets to be free and clear to operate without possibly being harassed by french troops because with german fleets i can free myself from scandinavia free an army for use in the south and just overall better my position on the board itd be pretty nice,1,True,1,russia,france,9,115,Fall,1902
i think the point is less that i would help them take the north sea and more that they should accept the loss of belgium as a fait accompli and focus on the north sea,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,116,Fall,1902
less a real alliance and more being a thought partner  im happy to talk to anyone after all,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,117,Fall,1902
heres a proposal for you well all trick the british together yes you have their trust you can convince them that because im going to use all my resources to clamp down norway meaning that they cannot possibly take it and that since the germans are obviously going to support munich with the army in kiel that they cannot take it furthermore you got the germans to admit that they will only be coming to netherlands with the fleet in belgium  the fleet in the helgoland bight  thus you suggest that they do a supported move to the netherlands using f north sea and a ruhr to block that while you take belgium  this will fool them sufficiently that the germans can use the army in kiel to support the fleet in belgium into the netherlands as well as the fleet in the bight ceding belgium to you in the process while also freeing me of one necessary support so that i can move from sweden to skagerrak and the british lose two of their units this build phase questions,0,True,1,russia,france,9,118,Fall,1902
in this scenario you could propose something on the lines of a kiel s f belgium  holland a stp s f sweden  norway f hel s f norway  nth,1,False,-1,france,russia,9,119,Fall,1902
this would secure norway and holland while also having good odds of catching england by surprise and seizing the north sea,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,120,Fall,1902
that would bounce in netherlands if they decided to use the north sea to move but im assuming that you would be convincing them to do the opposite,0,True,1,russia,france,9,121,Fall,1902
well that depends on whats in it for me im happy to talk but if you want concrete action theres a few more points that need to be ironed out,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,122,Fall,1902
firstly i already have belgium in the bag and similarly you have secured norway further action rests on the premise that we would like to help germany at englands expense ive yet to be convinced of this,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,123,Fall,1902
if you secure the north sea while controlling scandinavia you are likely to capture the lions share of englands centers after all,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,124,Fall,1902
you misunderstand me i want to crush the british for our mutual gainsecurity helping the germans has nothing to do with it materially its about eliminating a mutually existential threat,1,True,1,russia,france,9,125,Fall,1902
all id realistically ever want is edinburgh,1,True,1,russia,france,9,126,Fall,1902
if you send even one fleet to harass the english i could break out of their cordon and we could split them in two once theyre dead i dont give a toss about the germans you can do with them what you will,1,True,1,russia,france,9,127,Fall,1902
i think it would better serve my interests to crack germany first and then help you fight england you and germany actually have reasonably robust defensive positions against england after all,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,128,Fall,1902
if you like you could accelerate that process by occupying the baltic,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,129,Fall,1902
i cant occupy the baltic until the english are gone full stop i have had no opportunity to attack the germans at all with the english riding my ass like they are and wont for the foreseeable future if they keep those fleets hovering around me i think itd be far better for both of our peace of minds if we went for the one directly between us last,1,True,1,russia,france,9,130,Fall,1902
thats reasonable i suppose i think at this point my inclination is to seize belgium and see how things play out from there,1,False,-1,france,russia,9,131,Fall,1902
i dont feel like im at risk of being attacked by a englishgerman alliance which also means im not under a lot of pressure to commit to a side now,1,True,-1,france,russia,9,132,Fall,1902
well hopefully the british lose netherlands destroying two of their units would be nice hopefully thatd help convince you to take the side with the upper hand as well,1,True,1,russia,france,9,133,Fall,1902
at least until the germans lose their utility,1,True,1,russia,france,9,134,Fall,1902
okay my attack on england went nowhere probably time to pivot,1,False,-2,france,russia,9,135,Spring,1903
you sure you didnt mean italy,1,True,2,russia,france,9,136,Spring,1903
i actually meant germany but my attack on italy didnt go anywhere either,1,True,-2,france,russia,9,137,Spring,1903
probably pivot and attack england like you and germany wanted,1,True,-2,france,russia,9,138,Spring,1903
thatd be pretty cool of you,1,True,2,russia,france,9,139,Spring,1903
i think in practice that means f picardy  eng and a burgundy  picardy,1,True,-2,france,russia,9,140,Spring,1903
it would be really helpful if you and germany could evict england from the north sea as possible which should be possible with f nwy  f hol s f hel  nth a kie s f hol h,1,True,-2,france,russia,9,141,Spring,1903
ill relay to the germans,1,True,2,russia,france,9,142,Spring,1903
its kind of a bummer that the english went idle,1,True,5,russia,france,9,143,Winter,1903
indeed these things happen but its always frustrating,1,,-5,france,russia,9,144,Winter,1903
great turn for you it seems though,1,,-5,france,russia,9,145,Winter,1903
oh definitely im on fire over here,1,True,5,russia,france,9,146,Spring,1904
should we pull the trigger on a stab on germany england is as good as done,0,True,-5,france,russia,9,147,Fall,1904
heya there just dropping in to say hello,1,True,0,turkey,england,9,0,Spring,1901
hey turkey our paths probably won‚Äôt cross for a while l but may i suggest you attack russia i‚Äôve seen way to many games where russia is ignored and all of the sudden they have half the board anyways good lucks and have fun,1,True,0,england,turkey,9,1,Spring,1901
thanks ill definitely see what i can do a big russia is just as bad for me as everyone else,0,True,0,turkey,england,9,2,Spring,1901
sweet,1,True,0,england,turkey,9,3,Spring,1901
i was talking with russia negotiating over norway and such they told me they were planning on attacking you as they thought i was there ally the truth is i really dont want to see russia run off with this game so i decided to let you know,0,True,1,england,turkey,9,4,Fall,1902
thanks for the heads up,1,True,0,turkey,england,9,5,Winter,1902
hey france üòÅ i would like to suggest an alliance between the two of us against germany in my opinion a englandfrance alliance is super powerful especially if we can trust each other germany has reached out to me about an alliance to attack you but franly i think france as a country is a much more powerful allyto start i suggest we have the english channel as a dmz and coordinate and attack on germany anyways good luck and have fun,0,True,0,england,france,9,0,Spring,1901
dear england i completely agree that the frenchenglish alliance can be quite powerful naturally the main sticking point early on is whether we can trust each other to demilitarize the channel on my end i have little reason to go there unless i distrust you i plan to go to midatlantic which would allow me to move to spain south coast and establish an early presence in the mediterranean will also aim to get into burgundy where i can potentially support you into belgium my suggestion is that you open with f edinburgh  norwegian sea f london  north sea  a liverpool  yorkshire this guarrenteed you a build in norway even if russia moves a moscow north while potentially letting you convoy into belgium and you can be safe in the knowledge that either a yorkshire or f north sea can cover london in the event that i dont keep my word let me know your thoughts good luck to you as well,1,True,0,france,england,9,1,Spring,1901
sounds good,1,True,0,england,france,9,2,Spring,1901
how are your relations with germany,1,True,0,england,france,9,3,Spring,1901
getting into burgundy would be great i‚Äôll work some magic with germany and try to get them to not move there,1,True,0,england,france,9,4,Spring,1901
relations with germany are not outright hostile but its a little tense  bounce in burgundy is about what could be expected  since they moved to holland in spring youll need to talk to them regarding the belgium question but they can probably be brought around ill move to burgundy again but probably expecting another bounce,1,True,0,france,england,9,5,Fall,1901
so the thing is their going to have to choose between belgium and denmark if i let germany have belgium i could get denmark and have full control of scandinavia by 1902 from where i could launch a fullfledged russia attack,1,True,0,england,france,9,6,Fall,1901
im surprised germany is on board with this,1,True,0,france,england,9,7,Fall,1901
it means allowing you to border kiel but if theyre sincere and not just offering it because it would be easier for them to capture denmark next year than belgium,1,True,0,france,england,9,8,Fall,1901
then it could set you up well i assume you are convoying into denmark then,1,True,0,france,england,9,9,Fall,1901
well germany isnt on board with this yet i messaged them but they havnt responded yet,1,True,0,england,france,9,10,Fall,1901
well it certainly strengthens our alliance a lot if you are able to occupy denmark we would be far better placed to partition germany and it would be easier to check russian expansion,1,,0,france,england,9,11,Fall,1901
so if youre comfortable with it i suggest we just go ahead even if germany causes problems the two of us should be able to handle them,1,,0,france,england,9,12,Fall,1901
well if germany moves into denmark it sucks for me,1,True,0,england,france,9,13,Fall,1901
the last i spoke to germany they seemed interested in belgium but im not sure they had fully thought through the fact that taking belgium would mean giving up on either denmark or holland,1,True,0,france,england,9,14,Fall,1901
its obviously not ideal but a bounce in denmark would still be manageable  you still get one build in norway and germany would also be limited to one build in that scenario,1,True,0,france,england,9,15,Fall,1901
i‚Äôll wait and see what germany messages me back,1,True,0,england,france,9,16,Fall,1901
deadline is coming up suggest you submit draft orders and revise them ifwhen germany gets back,1,True,0,france,england,9,17,Fall,1901
germany just said their not willing to give up on denmakr,1,True,0,england,france,9,18,Fall,1901
oh have they offered you belgium in exchange,1,True,0,france,england,9,19,Fall,1901
i dont think its going to happen im not going to move to denmark,0,True,0,england,france,9,20,Fall,1901
also germany said you reached out to them about turning on me,1,True,0,england,france,9,21,Fall,1901
im not sure if germany is flat out lying or if theyre misunderstanding what i told them,1,,0,france,england,9,22,Fall,1901
i told them that id be willing to let them have belgium which they then unprompted took to mean i was offering them belgian in exchange for an alliance against you however what i meant was that it was just acknowledging facts i couldnt stop them from taking belgium even if i wanted to,1,True,0,france,england,9,23,Fall,1901
i think its already pretty clear that i trust you more than i trust germany just from the fact that i agreed to demilitarize the english channel while we had an arranged bounce in burgundy,1,True,0,france,england,9,24,Fall,1901
ok i believe you also i dont think germany is the most seasoned diplomacy player he told me he wanted to have an alliance with me but that i had to give him belgium holland and denmark in return,0,True,0,england,france,9,25,Fall,1901
yeah germany seems like a rather greedy player,1,True,0,france,england,9,26,Fall,1901
didn‚Äôt get into denmark but holland is very nice as well,1,True,0,england,france,9,27,Winter,1901
indeed congrats,1,True,0,france,england,9,28,Winter,1901
whats your plans for build i was thinking of building a marseilles to support myself into burgundy and advance against germany,1,True,0,france,england,9,29,Winter,1901
and then couple that with f brest which could go to picardy to contest belgium,1,True,0,france,england,9,30,Winter,1901
also you can probably guess just based on your current situation but germany as approached me about an alliance against you,1,True,0,france,england,9,31,Winter,1901
right hopefully you stick with the more competent player üòâ,1,True,0,england,france,9,32,Winter,1901
honestly i figured i should do my due diligence and consider it but i cant figure out how a francegerman alliance would even work in this situation its not as if he could support me into belgium,1,True,0,france,england,9,33,Winter,1901
u could tell him yes and then use that to stab,1,True,0,england,france,9,34,Winter,1901
i might do that but hes in a tight defensive enough position as is,0,,0,france,england,9,35,Winter,1901
which is why you would do that,1,True,0,england,france,9,36,Winter,1901
im thinking a build in london and a fleet in edinburg,1,True,0,england,france,9,37,Winter,1901
as in army in london and fleet in edinburgh,1,True,0,france,england,9,38,Winter,1901
yea,1,True,0,england,france,9,39,Winter,1901
makes sense,1,True,0,france,england,9,40,Winter,1901
frankly i dont like your fleet in bre an army could have contested belgium as well,1,True,0,england,france,9,41,Spring,1902
if you move it to the english channel im going to take that as on obvious sign of aggression and cover london if you move it to picardy were all good,1,True,0,england,france,9,42,Spring,1902
lol both russia and italy reached out to me asking if you had accidentally switched those builds i agree with them they do seem pretty strange,1,True,0,england,france,9,43,Spring,1902
strange or not im fairly sure i told you earlier that i was thinking of building a fleet and brest and didnt get any objections,1,True,0,france,england,9,44,Spring,1902
but at any rate i can promise you that it will be going to picardy rather than to the channel if it does go to the channel you should see that as an act of aggression on my part,1,True,0,france,england,9,45,Spring,1902
so ive heard that you told italy im planning to attack them with the fleet in spain,1,True,0,france,england,9,46,Spring,1902
never said that,0,True,0,england,france,9,47,Spring,1902
interesting well anyways thats not important id like to apologise again for building the fleet in brest without proper consultation  i assumed that you saw the message and were okay with it,1,True,0,france,england,9,48,Spring,1902
i will move to picardy and continue our demilitarization of the english channel hopefully we can put this behind us and focus on germany,1,True,0,france,england,9,49,Spring,1902
nice,1,True,0,england,france,9,50,Spring,1902
i should also be able to get into burgundy which would strengthen our position facing belgiim,1,True,0,france,england,9,51,Spring,1902
good,1,True,0,england,france,9,52,Spring,1902
where do you stand regarding russia by the way,1,,0,france,england,9,53,Spring,1902
i‚Äôm good with them just trying to talk to other countries to try to keep a balance of power over there in the south turkey is basically free centers and russia is looking a little worrying,1,True,0,england,france,9,54,Spring,1902
turkeys move to armenia should be a bit reassuring to you since it puts pressure on russia not to focus too much in the north,1,True,0,france,england,9,55,Spring,1902
but its a little halfhearted,1,True,0,france,england,9,56,Spring,1902
yes like the first turn,1,True,0,england,france,9,57,Spring,1902
one other thing to check  would you be comfortable with me sending f spain to mid atlantic in order to get a portugal out,1,True,0,france,england,9,58,Spring,1902
plan is to return to spain afterwards,1,True,0,france,england,9,59,Spring,1902
go ahead but i personally think you should attack italy,1,True,0,england,france,9,60,Spring,1902
attacking germany is the priority in my mind especially since a marseilles is needed on that front,1,True,0,france,england,9,61,Fall,1902
can consider how best to attack italy ifwhen germany is dealt with,1,True,0,france,england,9,62,Fall,1902
on that note  we now have a very messy map let me put some thoughts on how to proceed,1,True,0,france,england,9,63,Fall,1902
okay retaking norway is probably a lost cause given that russia tends to be a conservative player and such a player will probably be very tempted to just do  f sweden  a stp s f nwy h,1,True,0,france,england,9,64,Fall,1902
i will do a burgundy s f picardy  belgium which will cut support,1,True,0,france,england,9,65,Fall,1902
f nth s a ruhr  holland should then be able to hold holland,1,True,0,france,england,9,66,Fall,1902
germany will then have a disband  probably in kiel letting you rotate around into ska and take denmark,1,,0,france,england,9,67,Fall,1902
ok im here now,1,True,0,england,france,9,68,Fall,1902
its late at night for me so i might not stay up too long but what do you think of the suggestion,1,True,0,france,england,9,69,Fall,1902
i seriously doubt i can get norway back my moves last turn were well risky i asked if there was anything i could do for them to get norway back but i seriously doubt it belgium is guaranteed for you the thing is im not sure i can get holland germany probably anticipates you taking belgium and will move into holland with belgium and with support their going to get it,1,True,0,england,france,9,70,Fall,1902
which means im at 3 centers and wont have a chance of getting denmark,1,True,0,england,france,9,71,Fall,1902
thinking out loud here  if we assume germany will anticipate that i attack belgium and order a kiel  f hel s f bel  hol,1,True,0,france,england,9,72,Fall,1902
munich would be vulnerable,1,True,0,france,england,9,73,Fall,1902
would you be comfortable with f nth s f pic  bel a ruh s a bur  mun   from there i can support you into kiel andor holland,1,True,0,france,england,9,74,Fall,1902
im hearing you ask me to support you twice this turn if i do this i will almost undoubtedly lose two centers i will be at 3 you will be at 7,1,True,0,england,france,9,75,Fall,1902
its simply not fair i support you into belgium you support me into munich,1,True,0,england,france,9,76,Fall,1902
its always worth asking the complication is that i think munich is a really critical supply center for france but that being the case i can support you in for now and trade it for another supply center down the line,1,,0,france,england,9,77,Fall,1902
so yeah a burgundy can support you from ruhr into munich while f nth supports picardy  belgium,1,,0,france,england,9,78,Fall,1902
are we agreed,1,,0,france,england,9,79,Fall,1902
just so you know its like 2am in my time zone so if i dont hear back before i go to bed im just going to support myself into belgium dont want to risk losing a build to miscommunication so would just take the guaranteed option in that case,1,True,0,france,england,9,80,Fall,1902
ok id like to work things out,1,True,0,england,france,9,81,Fall,1902
lets do that how much longer are you here,1,True,0,england,france,9,82,Fall,1902
ill probably go to bed after we finish this conversation,1,True,0,france,england,9,83,Fall,1902
ok i was thinking do you want to have munich and i get belgium may require a bit of trust but i am full in for this alliance also munich is better for you to have then me,1,True,0,england,france,9,84,Fall,1902
i actually thought about that but its considerably riskier a ruhr is decently likely to have its support cut while its impossible for that to happen to a munich,1,True,0,france,england,9,85,Fall,1902
ok but i seriously doubt ruhr will have its support cut,1,True,0,england,france,9,86,Fall,1902
odds are low but its possible if germany things you want to backfill to nth,1,True,0,france,england,9,87,Fall,1902
but yeah im comfortable with betting that germany wont do that,1,True,0,france,england,9,88,Fall,1902
and also with trusting that your support will materialize,1,True,0,france,england,9,89,Fall,1902
so that would suggest f picardy s f nth  bel a bur  mun,1,True,0,france,england,9,90,Fall,1902
so which option i think we can bet that germany wont do that i think it is definitely the better move its just up to how much you trust me again im ready to go all the way with this alliance i think i might diplomatically have russia in the bag and be able to norway back from which i could get stp with me going for russia and maybe eventually italy i think we can get a two way win,0,True,0,england,france,9,91,Fall,1902
with munich under my control attacking italy or even austria becomes much more feasible  we would definitely be on track for a two way win especially with the eastern triangle going nowhere,1,True,0,france,england,9,92,Fall,1902
provided you agree im prepared to commit to  a ruhr s a bur  mun  f pic s f nth  bel,1,True,0,france,england,9,93,Fall,1902
just to check though  what are you possibly offering russia that makes them voluntarily return norway,1,True,0,france,england,9,94,Fall,1902
that sounds good,1,True,0,england,france,9,95,Fall,1902
im offering them support into denmark,1,True,0,england,france,9,96,Fall,1902
for this fall or next year,1,True,0,france,england,9,97,Fall,1902
they dont want to do it yet i do were still working it out,1,True,0,england,france,9,98,Fall,1902
you should also explore the option of them supporting you into denmark as compensation for taking norway,1,True,0,france,england,9,99,Fall,1902
lol they are a tough diplomat their never agreeing to that,1,True,0,england,france,9,100,Fall,1902
haha its only marginally worse than giving up norway,1,True,0,france,england,9,101,Fall,1902
ok sounds good sleep well,1,True,0,england,france,9,102,Fall,1902
i put in the order,1,True,0,france,england,9,103,Fall,1902
sameü•≥,1,True,0,england,france,9,104,Fall,1902
so this is what i get for trying to put in orders at 2am complete misorder,1,True,1,france,england,9,105,Winter,1902
what do you mean,1,True,-1,england,france,9,106,Winter,1902
i put in a burgundy  ruhr instead of to munich,1,True,1,france,england,9,107,Winter,1902
thats why i failed to capture munich,1,True,1,france,england,9,108,Winter,1902
it didn‚Äôt matter they supported munich,1,True,-1,england,france,9,109,Winter,1902
oh i actually missed that somehow i checked the orders early in the morning as well,1,True,1,france,england,9,110,Winter,1902
happens to all of us hey more sleep üò¥,1,True,-1,england,france,9,111,Winter,1902
okay were actually still in okay shape,1,True,1,france,england,9,112,Winter,1902
germany will need to disband but they need all their current units to make a defensive line,1,True,1,france,england,9,113,Winter,1902
so there will be a gap somewhere  lets see where in the morning,1,True,1,france,england,9,114,Winter,1902
yeah,1,True,-1,england,france,9,115,Winter,1902
germany doesn‚Äôt have to disband,1,True,-1,england,france,9,116,Winter,1902
wow i am really not on top of my game right now  okay aassume that we have belgium and north attacking holland and burgundy attacking munich kiel can support one of them to hold which would succeed this then turns into a guessing game,1,True,1,france,england,9,117,Winter,1902
germany can beat the odds by having russia do f nwy  nth to cut support coupled with a kiel s a mun h but russia takes on considerable risk in doing so,1,True,1,france,england,9,118,Winter,1902
the real wild card is that if italy or austria lets me through into tyrolia we can hit munich from the south,1,True,1,france,england,9,119,Winter,1902
ill try to lobby for that while we play the odds in the north,1,True,1,france,england,9,120,Winter,1902
sounds good russia i seriously doubt they are going to help germany,1,True,-1,england,france,9,121,Winter,1902
yeah lets see i dont think theyre big fans of you either  in terms of actual moves could your a ruhr provide support for me to hit ruhr again,1,,1,france,england,9,122,Spring,1903
heya there,1,True,0,turkey,france,9,0,Spring,1901
thoughts on an information sharing pact with respect to italy,1,True,0,turkey,france,9,1,Spring,1901
we dont have to attack them right away but neither of us benefits if they get too big ya,1,True,0,turkey,france,9,2,Spring,1901
agreed obviously england and germany are more immediate concerns for me as are austria and russia for you but neither of us wants to see italy expand too far and it would be of mutual benefit to share any information that we hear about them,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,3,Spring,1901
on a related note have you heard from russia or austria im curious to see if russia plans to send a moscow north or south,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,4,Spring,1901
i dont really have a good read on russia to be honest,0,True,0,turkey,france,9,5,Spring,1901
unless you have a sea lion going with him tho i doubt hed go north,1,True,0,turkey,france,9,6,Spring,1901
austria is telling me theyre going for russia but thats what every austria tells turkey lol,1,True,0,turkey,france,9,7,Spring,1901
you hear anything on your end about england  germany,1,True,0,turkey,france,9,8,Spring,1901
havent heard from germany,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,9,Spring,1901
england told me that germany reached out to him about an alliance but he would rather ally with me im very confident in the first part the second remains to be seen,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,10,Spring,1901
italy is saying that a frenchitaly war is a waste of time for both us which is true but may not be good news for turkey unless you want to ally with them against austria,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,11,Spring,1901
havent heard anything from austria or russia either,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,12,Spring,1901
hm thanks for the advice ill keep an eye out for the lepanto then,1,True,0,turkey,france,9,13,Spring,1901
update on italy  they just told me that they dont feel it wise to get into an early fight with austria assuming that theyve been telling me the truth a big if that makes the lepanto highly likely,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,14,Spring,1901
i guess its too much to hope for that they just sit on their hands for a few years lol,0,True,0,turkey,france,9,15,Spring,1901
indeed hard to get a read on a group that is organized in such an unusual way but it feels like its mostly experienced players here,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,16,Spring,1901
seems to be yea,1,True,0,turkey,france,9,17,Spring,1901
all the moves are pointing to a pretty stock standard lepanto here in the east so if you want to swing your fleet down into the med thatd be appreciated on my end and you should have a good shot at making progress if italy commits any further this way,1,True,0,turkey,france,9,18,Fall,1901
yeah thats the plan will move f mao  spa sc which should give me some presence in the med and put a little bit of pressure on italy,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,19,Fall,1901
how is your relationship with russia are you planning to allow them into rumania,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,20,Fall,1901
im thinking ill try to contest just so they cant get a fleet into bla i havent been hearing too much from my neighbors so im kinda nervous üòÖ,0,True,0,turkey,france,9,21,Fall,1901
really russia has been pretty talkative with me actually havent heard much from austria though,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,22,Fall,1901
hear anything interesting ,1,True,0,turkey,france,9,23,Fall,1901
russia was really stressed about whether germany would bounce them in denmark and then germany opened to netherlands,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,24,Fall,1901
in general they strike me as a fairly cautious defensive player,1,True,0,france,turkey,9,25,Fall,1901
mm thanks,1,True,0,turkey,france,9,26,Fall,1901
if you want to tap tyr i can crash into ion,1,True,-1,turkey,france,9,27,Fall,1903
i dont have the firepower to get anywhere after tapping tyr,1,True,1,france,turkey,9,28,Fall,1903
mm i see,1,True,-1,turkey,france,9,29,Fall,1903
well just putting the option out there i guess,1,True,-1,turkey,france,9,30,Fall,1903
you have anything else in mind,1,True,-1,turkey,france,9,31,Fall,1903
i guess id also be happy to support you into getting tun after im in ion if youd be interested in that,1,True,-1,turkey,france,9,32,Fall,1903
that would be interesting but i think i want the position with england to improve before committing to anything,1,,1,france,turkey,9,33,Fall,1903
greetings  i was just wondering what your aims were regarding territory in the area may i suggest that we keep tyr as a dmz for the time being,1,True,0,italy,germany,10,0,Spring,1901
hello italy i can agree to those terms,1,True,0,germany,italy,10,1,Spring,1901
can i ask whether you plan to ally with italy or france,1,True,0,germany,italy,10,2,Spring,1901
id like to think im already allied with italy üòÖ,1,True,0,italy,germany,10,3,Spring,1901
haha good one i think i meant france or austria,1,True,0,germany,italy,10,4,Spring,1901
am currently speaking to both but havent really moved towards either as of yet  what are your plans vis a vis alliances and expansion,0,,0,italy,germany,10,5,Spring,1901
in discussions about what is off limits for the first turn with russia,1,True,0,germany,italy,10,6,Spring,1901
still waiting to hear from or waiting to see first moves of other neighbors,1,True,0,germany,italy,10,7,Spring,1901
thats fair good to be cautious,1,True,0,italy,germany,10,8,Spring,1901
hey italy i‚Äôd like to make sure tyr remains as dmz from both you and austria so i‚Äôm going to leave an army in mun,1,True,0,germany,italy,10,9,Spring,1901
have you and austria considered a lepanto,1,True,0,germany,italy,10,10,Spring,1901
ive raised the idea with him just waiting to hear back,1,True,0,italy,germany,10,11,Spring,1901
i‚Äôve heard that france is moving pie  mar i wanted to share that with you since i am interested in you headed for turkey,1,True,0,germany,italy,10,12,Fall,1901
okay thanks for that,1,True,0,italy,germany,10,13,Fall,1901
venpie and then support me in to mar i‚Äôd appreciate the help and could return the favor later,1,True,1,germany,italy,10,14,Spring,1902
sounds good consider it done,1,True,-1,italy,germany,10,15,Spring,1902
good to hear are you moving in on turkey too they kinda became a sitting duck after missing last turn,1,True,1,germany,italy,10,16,Spring,1902
thats the plan,1,True,-1,italy,germany,10,17,Spring,1902
in return for my help in taking down france could you support me into mar instead ill then help you mop up from there,1,True,-1,italy,germany,10,18,Spring,1902
i‚Äôm not sure i could this year based on what‚Äôs going on on the other side of switzerland but if all goes well we can revisit this in the fall,1,False,1,germany,italy,10,19,Spring,1902
so are you not bothering with mar this turn or are you saying that you want it and then i could take it in the fall   not entirely sure what youre proposing,1,True,-1,italy,germany,10,20,Spring,1902
sorry for being unclear i would like to have one of us take it in the fall but my priority with my army in bur is first to the northern areas so if i need to use that army not in mar in the fall then we can‚Äôt take mar so if you don‚Äôt want to move to pie yet because of my uncertainty that‚Äôs ok does that make sense,1,True,1,germany,italy,10,21,Spring,1902
ah thats fair no worries,1,True,-1,italy,germany,10,22,Spring,1902
can you support me into mar if i support you they‚Äôll just cut my support from paris,1,False,1,germany,italy,10,23,Fall,1902
is england not your ally,1,True,-1,italy,germany,10,24,Fall,1902
par is france so that‚Äôs the issue not england,1,True,1,germany,italy,10,25,Fall,1902
no i understand that its just that england is poised to take bre and so i imagine france will be more interested in supporting bre than they are with disrupting you as such i dont see it as much of a risk if you were to support me into mar,1,True,-1,italy,germany,10,26,Fall,1902
ill support you into mar but i want spain and portugal if thats alright,1,True,-1,italy,germany,10,27,Fall,1902
deal can you get a fleet over there,1,True,1,germany,italy,10,28,Fall,1902
not this turn but will do next year after taking out turkey,1,True,-1,italy,germany,10,29,Fall,1902
perfect good luck wrapping up with turkey,1,True,1,germany,italy,10,30,Fall,1902
thanks for the support i didn‚Äôt anticipate france supporting mar,1,,1,germany,italy,10,31,Fall,1902
if england turns on me after france i‚Äôd appreciate it if you and i could work together you could end up with mar spa and por,1,True,1,germany,italy,10,32,Fall,1902
that sounds good to me we should be able to take him down together should it come to it,1,True,-1,italy,germany,10,33,Fall,1902
france is threatening to give all of his centres to england if i dont back off immediately,1,True,-1,italy,germany,10,34,Fall,1902
that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm suspecting is about to happen to me too just asked france for an explanation i wonder if it‚Äôs a ploy by france to game us against each other,1,True,1,germany,italy,10,35,Fall,1902
i‚Äôve offered france the opportunity to rebuild and work against england in case they reach out to you,1,True,2,germany,italy,10,36,Winter,1902
i‚Äôd like to get england around spain and closer to going after you next so their out of position,1,True,2,germany,italy,10,37,Winter,1902
okay sounds good will be interesting to hear their response,1,True,-2,italy,germany,10,38,Winter,1902
i‚Äôm open to other ideas if you have them but if they surrender to england i think we‚Äôre done for,1,True,2,germany,italy,10,39,Winter,1902
i completely agree there we cant have england taking all of their cps,1,True,-2,italy,germany,10,40,Winter,1902
good and it doesn‚Äôt look like you‚Äôll be able to pick any centers up from turkey unless austria or russia is working with you can you start moving you fleets back into the west med they could come in handy very soon,1,True,2,germany,italy,10,41,Winter,1902
aye theyll both be heading back asap,1,True,-2,italy,germany,10,42,Winter,1902
france is out they‚Äôre going to hand their centers over to england and think they‚Äôre going to be left with one,1,True,2,germany,italy,10,43,Spring,1903
i don‚Äôt think we can take out england if this happens want to ensure we wipe france off the board first,1,True,2,germany,italy,10,44,Spring,1903
damn  yeah can do hopefully if we can secure a few points well stand a chance of fighting off england,1,True,-2,italy,germany,10,45,Spring,1903
agreed but i don‚Äôt think this is the turn to do it anymore thoughts,1,True,2,germany,italy,10,46,Spring,1903
not sure what you mean there,1,True,-2,italy,germany,10,47,Spring,1903
oh sorry the turn to make the stab on england,1,True,2,germany,italy,10,48,Spring,1903
ah right yes i agree,1,True,-2,italy,germany,10,49,Spring,1903
nice job getting mar are you planning on pushing toward spain,1,True,3,germany,italy,10,50,Fall,1904
been talking to france to see if he can help to push england out of the med  have you had any contact with england,1,True,-3,italy,germany,10,51,Fall,1904
a little just talking about my front with russia i mean you could take wes and then you‚Äôd have access to spain and portugal,1,True,3,germany,italy,10,52,Fall,1904
am planning on taking it this turn  am mainly using france as a diversion for england,1,True,-3,italy,germany,10,53,Fall,1904
thanks please let me know if you find out that france wants to move toward any of my centers,1,True,3,germany,italy,10,54,Fall,1904
i will do  im only using him as a means to an end so hopefully he shouldnt pose that sort of threat for much longer  who are you planning on going after next may i ask,1,True,-3,italy,germany,10,55,Fall,1904
taking back mun first hopefully and then need to see where loyalties lie between russia and austria i still am in too awkward of a position to move on england that wouldn‚Äôt let both of them destroy me,1,True,3,germany,italy,10,56,Fall,1904
thats fair  good luck with mun  do let me know should you need any help with anything in the future,1,True,-3,italy,germany,10,57,Fall,1904
greetings  i was just wondering what your aims were regarding territory in the area may i suggest that we keep tyr as a dmz for the time being,1,True,0,italy,austria,10,0,Spring,1901
hi there italy  in my experience austria and italy fighting anytime before 1904 or so ends one way they are both eliminated  so keeping a dmz is good ideally find a way to keep all four of trl adr tri and ven as a dmz but even better would be a joint goal we can work together on  typically as austria my thoughts are to keep russia and turkey from allying and pick one side against the other  if you wanted to go after turkey with me that could work but if you wanted to go after france with either english or german help i could go after russia with turkish help  in general i guess i‚Äôm saying i‚Äôm willing to go almost any sensible way that goes along with an alliance which i can grow to trust üôÇ,1,True,0,austria,italy,10,1,Spring,1901
i was definitely thinking of going after france as i find they can quickly spiral out of control if uncontested  might be best if you go after turkey with russia and ill focus my attention west,1,,0,italy,austria,10,2,Spring,1901
awesome  i reached out to russia and will let you know how that turns out you have any indications that you‚Äôll get any help against france it can be a slow and annoying slog if you go 11 against them,1,True,0,austria,italy,10,3,Spring,1901
england seems to be interested so hopefully we can nip france in the bud asap,1,True,0,italy,austria,10,4,Spring,1901
so how did we want to move in spring to set us both up to feel safe and not tightly entangled in each other‚Äôs business  any particular moves you have in mind given what you‚Äôve been hearing,1,True,0,austria,italy,10,5,Spring,1901
do you want to move against turkey quickly if so i can suggest a strategy for us to take him out,1,False,0,italy,austria,10,6,Spring,1901
i‚Äôd be happy to go after turkey  once they control aeg  bla they are nearly impossible to ferret out of that corner  but if you‚Äôre going after france with english help nothing i do even with russian help will go fast against turkey unless the turk just totally doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing they‚Äôll go down just not super fast  that‚Äôs just how it goes against the corner pocket powers,1,True,0,austria,italy,10,7,Spring,1901
this article has an effective strategy for neutralising turkey but wed need to work very closely together what do you think  httpwwwdiplomacyarchivecomresourcesstrategyarticleslepantohtm,1,True,0,italy,austria,10,8,Spring,1901
the lepanto works well against turkey but does require our combined full attention it would mean you decide to drop your idea of going after france because you‚Äôd need both your first fleet and the one you build in winter to be used in the east  if you‚Äôre interested in going easy with me instead of taking on france then sure i‚Äôll go to alb in spring and gre in fall which sets us up for a supported attack on aeg in spring 02,1,True,0,austria,italy,10,9,Spring,1901
i appreciate your being true to your word and leaving trl open i trusted you and moved away from our mutual border  i expect that france will run away from pie now that they‚Äôre under attack but if you want to follow venpie we would be in an easy position to have both ven trl adr and tri all open as a safe dmz and could agree not to build in tri or ven without prior agreement  let‚Äôs us work as safely together as any alliance could be while we go after turkey without leaving many units home ‚Äúwasted‚Äù just guarding against each other,1,True,0,austria,italy,10,10,Fall,1901
of course if i end up bouncing in gal again i may have to build another army in tri so if you want to leave ven where it is and watch what france does for now that‚Äôs cool too,1,True,0,austria,italy,10,11,Fall,1901
those terms sounds most agreeable i think its definitely in our interest to work closely together,1,True,0,italy,austria,10,12,Fall,1901
for this turn i will stay in venice just to see if france pulls back just letting you know for full disclosure,1,True,0,italy,austria,10,13,Fall,1901
i totally understand i appreciate the transparency adr  trl still dmz but i understand your needing to wait in ven to see what france does  do you feel youll have to take tunis with the fleet or can we still do the lepanto  taking it with f iontun slows us down by a full turn in our eastward movements but if thats what needs to happen so be it,1,True,0,austria,italy,10,14,Fall,1901
im going to convoy into tunis so as not to move the fleet,1,True,0,italy,austria,10,15,Fall,1901
excellent thatll set us up for a convoy to either syria as a sneak attack or right into constantinople if i can get into bulgaria to support it depending on which way the turk tries to defend,1,True,0,austria,italy,10,16,Fall,1901
ideal reckon well have him out soon enough,1,True,0,italy,austria,10,17,Fall,1901
oh just for full disclosure on my part i may drop vieven to cover that since it‚Äôs a fall turn and well ‚Äútrust but verify‚Äù is always sensible right üôÇ,0,True,0,austria,italy,10,18,Fall,1901
i totally understand go for it,1,True,0,italy,austria,10,19,Fall,1901
ill build in vie and bud and leave trieste open to help enforce our dmz  it looks like france wont be able to build any fleets so i guess well see how long they can keep england and germany from eating them up eh  you may want to consider using your rearguard army in venice in france either you can offer to help kill france in exchange for a supply center mar or prop them up to slow down the eg alliance from progressing too fast by using a pie s mar which france will need once theres a german army in gas  just some thoughts,1,True,1,austria,italy,10,20,Winter,1901
im setting up the convoy this turn are you able to shift southeast to assist in attacking turkey,1,True,-1,italy,austria,10,21,Spring,1902
yep  im taking bul with russian help this next turn and in the fall can both tap con to cut any supports it may give as well as move greaeg to help support your attacks on smy  does that work for you,1,True,1,austria,italy,10,22,Spring,1902
sounds good im helping to take down france as well,1,True,-1,italy,austria,10,23,Spring,1902
cool  be tough about it if they ask for your help since you cant easily go over there with strength until youve completed the convoy demand they get  you into mar as the first step and from there youll support the rest of their attacks  if they say no you can always say if im not getting anything out of it i may as well support france instead of supporting their demise you know üôÇ,1,True,1,austria,italy,10,24,Spring,1902
actually now that i look at the board more closely since turkey built an army they are basically permanently no threat if you want to change direction and focus your attention to focus on france i wouldn‚Äôt see it as a betrayal  my advance on turkey would go slower but it would still work as two fleets aren‚Äôt necessary to force advancement into aeg either way if you want to keep going east i‚Äôll help you into smy if you‚Äôll help me into con after,1,True,1,austria,italy,10,25,Spring,1902
i think well do the smy and con i need me some supply centres,1,True,-1,italy,austria,10,26,Spring,1902
sounds like a plan,1,True,1,austria,italy,10,27,Spring,1902
as you imagine i‚Äôm heading to aeg now to help speed up the dismantling of the turkey carcass  what‚Äôs up in france  germany going to let you have mar or are you going to slow down their advance so we can resolve the east before they get done in the west,1,True,1,austria,italy,10,28,Fall,1902
he wants me to support him into mar as hes worried theyll cut his supplies from paris,1,True,-1,italy,austria,10,29,Fall,1902
makes sense  germany has some guessing games in there,1,True,1,austria,italy,10,30,Fall,1902
i‚Äôd normally build a vie but england has 4 fleets ready to pour around gibraltar into the med they‚Äôll say it‚Äôs to kill france but what do they do after taking spain an portugal and even after we get you this build from smy we‚Äôll only have 4 combined between the two of us  if you want me to build a fleet i can but if i don‚Äôt hear from you i‚Äôll assume a vie,1,True,2,austria,italy,10,31,Winter,1902
you can build the army if you want hopefully well be able to take enough ground to build up our navy soon enough,1,True,-2,italy,austria,10,32,Winter,1902
i‚Äôm fine either way just trying to pick which way covers the most options vie protects from germany but they‚Äôre still busy and russia can help hold them off too  a fleet makes sure england is matched but like you‚Äôre saying we can hopefully do that next year too,1,True,2,austria,italy,10,33,Winter,1902
germany has just told me that hes offered france protection if he goes against england,1,True,-2,italy,austria,10,34,Winter,1902
oh wow that would be very helpful  ill talk to him to encourage that  england could be a huge threat with all those fleets if nobody goes against them,1,True,2,austria,italy,10,35,Winter,1902
im going to bring my fleets back over as youve got turkey pretty much sorted now with russia,1,True,-2,italy,austria,10,36,Winter,1902
makes sense  you going to try and help france and germany against england  or attack france while germany protects them  or just cover to make sure england doest swing too fast into the med,1,True,2,austria,italy,10,37,Winter,1902
mainly cover against eng,1,True,-2,italy,austria,10,38,Winter,1902
yeah good plan  4 fleets right there is a lot,1,True,2,austria,italy,10,39,Winter,1902
france is dipping out and giving his points to england hopefully germany and i can take a few and maybe stand a chance of taking the fight to england,1,True,-2,italy,austria,10,40,Spring,1903
makes sense  itll be a race to get there in time,1,True,2,austria,italy,10,41,Spring,1903
it looks like germany and england are coming east already  im set up to push into munich once you can get around to marseille and burgundy  i think i need to build a fleet this year because we otherwise dont have enough fleets to hold england back even if russia and i can make headway on the land  or are you trying to help france survive now  should i negotiate with them to offer support of burmun  i think we need to get you a build from marseille sooner rather than later right,0,True,2,austria,italy,10,42,Fall,1903
ive negotiated with france so that for now hes going to let me into mar if i support him into spain for now  if he can help us kick britain out of the med then im willing to do that for him now  you should probably ask him about burmun as i reckon hell want the help,1,True,-3,italy,austria,10,43,Winter,1903
oh i just realized germany is getting a build so it will probably be an army in kiel which will keep me from being able to get burmun to succeed  but as long as i keep attacking mun with support itll keep the german with all three units locked in place for now which will hopefully help you in france,0,True,3,austria,italy,10,44,Winter,1903
fantastic,1,True,-3,italy,austria,10,45,Winter,1903
we are going to need one of my fleets to move into ion because you dont want to have to waste f tys s tun against two english fleets forever  have they talked to you at all  seems like their actions speak louder than words,1,True,3,austria,italy,10,46,Fall,1904
i must say that as much i dont want to think it you do seem to be converging to make a move against me,1,True,-3,italy,austria,10,47,Fall,1904
if i wanted to attack you i could indeed peel you apart right now and theres not much you could do about it  if i totally stay away from you england pushes you right back to the borders of your homeland and probably overcomes your defenses given the location of the units right now  where would i be if that happened  do you think you have some tactics which would hold them off without any help from me  if you have a plan that looks solid im all ears  i built the fleet as i mentioned specifically because england otherwise had us outgunned at sea and clearly wasnt planning on fighting germany,1,True,3,austria,italy,10,48,Fall,1904
thats what i wanted to hear i believe you  you can move that fleet into the ioanian of course  my only communication with england so far has been them trying to bargain with me to let them move on to take you out so far i have not responded but should we see an opportunity i could always see how far a lie could get me,1,True,-3,italy,austria,10,49,Fall,1904
i doubt england will believe either of us üò¶,1,True,3,austria,italy,10,50,Fall,1904
probably not but could be worth a shot at some point,1,True,-3,italy,austria,10,51,Fall,1904
true  maybe try and see what they want,1,True,3,austria,italy,10,52,Fall,1904
see i told you that you could trust me  nice defensive work btw  england cant hold tunis long once you pull a fleet out into tys we can take it back,1,True,3,austria,italy,10,53,Fall,1904
my army in pie will be supporting mar  unless were using marbur to cut the support bur can give to mun in which case pie can support golmar as a beleagured garrison to make sure you hold onto it,1,True,3,austria,italy,10,54,Fall,1904
i think ill be holding in mar this turn want to shore up the med before attempting to move on again,1,True,-3,italy,austria,10,55,Fall,1904
if youre holding you can count on pie to support it to hold so you can focus your fleets on naval manouevers  speaking of which we should talk tactics to keep the strongest position  and youre building a fleet right,1,True,3,austria,italy,10,56,Winter,1904
aye i think a fleet would be the most useful for fighting england,1,True,-3,italy,austria,10,57,Winter,1904
gol s wes wes s iontun romtys pie s mar mar s spa and we ask france to do spa s wes  most likely england orders naf s tun so as not to lose that but then we hold position while romtys tightens the noose  if on the other hand they give up on tunis in spring by doing naf and mao s tunwes it does explode your fleet but then we have tys and tun and you can rebuild the fleet and i can also build one if needed  what do you think,1,True,3,austria,italy,10,58,Spring,1905
that sounds agreeable to me just as a note though will i be getting tun back at some point in your plan,1,True,-3,italy,austria,10,59,Spring,1905
i most likely wont get in  if i were england id use naf to support tun this season  in which case tys and ion can work together to attack it next season  but if i do get in we get you that one back or spain if we can get france into portugal at some point whichever is easiest to juggle around  if you ended up with both spain and got tunis back am i just using three of my units out of the goodness of my heart  p   but seriously priority one is push england out of the med priority two is to crack the eg defense line and beyond that we just make sure to divide spoils fairly and in a defensible way no point in me owning portugal as how could i defend that,0,True,3,austria,italy,10,60,Spring,1905
thats fair we should have this if we play our cards right,1,True,-3,italy,austria,10,61,Spring,1905
yep there are some guessing games but i think we have the better position now,1,True,3,austria,italy,10,62,Spring,1905
so we can get you tunis this season guaranteed wesnaf ion s tystun tystun  but in exchange can you also help me and russia in germany by doing marbur to cut their support,0,True,3,austria,italy,10,63,Fall,1905
we could protect mar by doing pie s lyomar to give it a beleagured garrison,1,True,3,austria,italy,10,64,Fall,1905
i can definitely do marbur the rest of it sounds good,1,True,-3,italy,austria,10,65,Fall,1905
ugh sorry about that  i just got worried everybody was getting builds and i wasn‚Äôt but wanted to maintain the great position pushing england back  i shouldn‚Äôt have taken venice without asking,0,True,3,austria,italy,10,66,Fall,1905

greetings  i was just wondering what your aims were regarding territory in the area may i suggest that we keep pie as a dmz for the time being,1,True,0,italy,france,10,0,Spring,1901
sure could we expand that dmz all the way to naf,1,True,0,france,italy,10,1,Spring,1901

so what is happening in the east,1,True,0,france,italy,10,3,Spring,1901
havent really made plans with any of them yet going to see the opening moves,0,True,0,italy,france,10,4,Spring,1901

what armyfleet do you want supporting into spain i can agree to these terms,1,True,2,italy,france,10,10,Winter,1903
could you use gol to support spain holding,1,True,-2,france,italy,10,11,Winter,1903
sure consider it done,1,True,2,italy,france,10,12,Winter,1903
you can have marseille,1,True,-2,france,italy,10,13,Spring,1904

i am supporting tys to wes can you use mar to support spain hold,1,True,-2,france,italy,10,15,Fall,1904
aye thats locked in now im using tun to hopefully disrupt naf as well,1,True,2,italy,france,10,16,Fall,1904
do you reckon you could do spa s wes,1,True,3,italy,france,10,17,Spring,1905
i could,0,True,-3,france,italy,10,18,Spring,1905
hi there germany  we can both agree that one of us dying early doesn‚Äôt bode well for the other right  want to establish a ‚Äúintelligence sharing pact‚Äù to help make sure some early stability for each other means we can both survive into the midgame where perhaps we can actually coordinate,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,0,Spring,1901
yes i‚Äôd like that currently england has suggested they would like to be my ally and italy wants tyr to remain empty,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,1,Spring,1901
so if italy is asking both of us to leave trl empty you know what that probably means ,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,2,Spring,1901
what information do you have,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,3,Spring,1901
no proof just that italy asked for a dmz in trl but england says they haven‚Äôt discussed going after france together which makes me think italy is trying to keep trl open so they can walk in there themselves  not sure though  also heard russia is probably moving south as usual but to be used with me against turkey or against me with turkey only time will tell,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,4,Spring,1901
any word from france,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,5,Spring,1901
france has had limited communication trying to get me to not be aggressive toward them i will plan to leave an army in mun to dissuade italy from going to tyr i‚Äôll let them know that if they more there i‚Äôll use that army to work with you against them,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,6,Spring,1901
italy seems committed to avoiding tyr do you have any interest in working with them against turkey,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,7,Spring,1901
perhaps italy is truly willing to avoid trl  it‚Äôs always hard to tell before the first moves come out  i‚Äôm happy to work worth them if they aim towards turkey instead of towards me,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,8,Spring,1901
i‚Äôll be in mun to back you up if they are lying to us any chance of you being interested in convincing italy to lepanto,1,,0,germany,austria,10,9,Spring,1901
if you want to move mun you can always move it back there in the fall in case italy lied so if i were you i‚Äôd make better use of it i like munruh in spring 01 you have a say in who gets bel or you can guarantee hol and you‚Äôre still right next to mun in case italy is in trl or france goes to bur,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,10,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm negotiating with italy about working with them in the east yes and it hinges on us both agreeing to leave trl empty yes,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,11,Spring,1901
i get there might be better uses and i might do that if you come to a good agreement with italy for the east and feel confident in them it‚Äôs imperative to me that you stay alive or i‚Äôll probably get eaten by the east so let me know how talks with them go and i may change orders,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,12,Spring,1901
so it looks like italy was trustworthy england is cutthroat and france is weird  you going to work with england against france or the other way around,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,13,Fall,1901
i can‚Äôt figure france out i think they must be very new to the game they agreed to dmz ec though as far as i know so england is going straight for them,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,14,Fall,1901
france told me you had ec as dmz and i wasn‚Äôt openly aggressive so i‚Äôll pretend like i‚Äôm going to side with them to get their orders,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,15,Fall,1901
ok all i hear from france is theyre sending piemar which is probably the truth  what are you thoughts on russia  going to let them have swe for a likely second build or hold them smaller in the north for now  i can probably be fine either way but would like to have some idea which to plan for,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,16,Fall,1901
france wants me to join them against italy i want italy to go east but toward turkey definitely not toward you since you cover my weak spots from russia and turkey,1,,0,germany,austria,10,17,Fall,1901
i think i‚Äôll bounce russia in sweden don‚Äôt see a reason not to and that‚Äôll hold off a build for them i haven‚Äôt heard much from them very direct about answering only what i am asking them,1,,0,germany,austria,10,18,Fall,1901
where did you hear about france‚Äôs move,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,19,Fall,1901
france told me directly that they were moving back away from venice  i dont see any reason why theyd lie to me about that since im the one who could help them right now if they asked and if i wanted to which i dont but they didnt even ask,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,20,Fall,1901
italy is most likely going east against the turk as long as france is off their back and i dont attack them i dont intend to attack italy thats crazy for austria in the early game,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,21,Fall,1901
right so do you know if italy is aware of france pulling back,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,22,Fall,1901
italy asked me if it was ok if they hung around in venice for now to watch and see if france really did pull away  i told them of course it was ok and that i appreciated them letting me know theyd still be sitting right next to trieste  so i think italy and i are at least being pretty up front about what were doing  i dont think italy knows if they can trust france after france just walked into piedmont and will prefer to see how it shakes out,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,23,Fall,1901
good to hear i‚Äôd like it if us central powers could remain open i plan to move out of mun but am not sure where yet as france and england are talking to me about different options,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,24,Fall,1901
cool  i dont see how france has much to offer you at this point support into belgium i guess but i can see the appeal of burgundy  france kinda collapses if they lose that line but once theyve picked up builds from spain  portugal it gets wayyyy harder,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,25,Fall,1901
absolutely they can‚Äôt get both builds in iberia that soon because of their current locations but i also don‚Äôt want england to stab me in the process either,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,26,Fall,1901
england seems like an aggressive player but a good one and imo a good player in england‚Äôs position has far more to gain by a concerted attack with you against france than just stabbing you with no clear help  france tells me they‚Äôre going pie back to mar so consider that in your planning if it‚Äôs helpful,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,27,Fall,1901
i appreciate the help i‚Äôll consider that,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,28,Fall,1901
let me know what you want to do after builds i think if you‚Äôre not busy with turkey we could start thinking about russia,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,29,Winter,1901
are you thinking about opening up a two front war in france and russia  that has  historically not gone well for germany,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,30,Winter,1901
no not in the near future i‚Äôve seen how it plays out just like to get ideas of what you‚Äôre thinking earlier rather than later,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,31,Winter,1901
did turkey hold for all of their units or just not submit orders this is my first time playing on backstabbr,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,32,Winter,1901
turkey says they messed up the submit button somehow its easy to do actually  very frustrating when you dont verify that theyre really submitted so held by accident  but it basically means theyre kinda toast at this point  ill probably go with russia and italy against them at least for a short time,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,33,Winter,1901
that‚Äôs too bad leaves them a sitting duck,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,34,Winter,1901
however once youve subdued france a bit and ive shrunk turkey down to a manageable size i think then is the right time to focus our combine attention on russia  in the meantime you and england should definitely make sure to keep them contained in the north,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,35,Winter,1901
speaking of england one thing annoying about eg alliances is that you really only have this one chance to build a fleet without signalling your change of intentions too obviously now  right now a fleet berlin build does not scareworry your english ally because its clearly meant to pin down scandanavia f den s berbal next season f bal s denswe and you work with england to support them into stp  any build of a fleet later is clearly meant to attack england and they see it coming  its almost as obvious a telegraphed signal as austria building a fleet i could tell italy that ill use it against turkey but theyd have to be pretty dumb to believe that,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,36,Winter,1901
yeah good points i‚Äôll see what i can do,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,37,Winter,1901
for what its worth if you and england go after swe  stp i dont really see russia trying to retaliate on land that stretches them super wide and thin with some armies in the south fighting turkey and some against you and a big gaping hole in the middle where i sit with a pile of armies  so if theyre sensible theyll just grumble loudly and ignore the loss in the north biding their time to strike back once turkeys subdued and they hope they can trust me to join them against you  its all in the timing though  id certainly not prefer it but you could play nice with them hoping you can work with them against me in the midgame  but im going to hope you dont go that way because doing that just leaves your back wide open to english perfidy üôÇ,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,38,Winter,1901
that‚Äôs exactly why i brought up russia in a few more rounds i see them being just as thin but you me and england being stronger and with less weak spots near them,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,39,Winter,1901
yep im right there with you lets keep watch and if my working with them means that they end up getting a build from turkey likely esp if turkey keeps messing up like this past season ill let you know in advance so that perhaps thats a time when you and england can make sure the lose one in the north at the same time to stay thin enough üôÇ,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,40,Winter,1901
how‚Äôs it going  is italy helping france survive helping you kill them faster or begging for a piece of the pie  looks like you‚Äôve got russia pretty well pinned down in the north too,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,41,Fall,1902
going pretty good looks like it for you too i think italy is coming in to get their piece of france before it‚Äôs all gone we‚Äôll see how it gets divided yeah especially with england‚Äôs fleets up north,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,42,Fall,1902
you and russia have got turkey finished off in a matter of a few turns it looks like any idea of where you‚Äôre going next,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,43,Fall,1902
i‚Äôd be game for doing some damage to russia with you or if you decide to it‚Äôs time to go after england with some minor russian help i could go the other way and take on italy  i‚Äôm flexible üôÇ  my only preference is coordination me going after russia while you going after england leaves us both in 11 situations inefficient  so i like it when directions change in close order when possible,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,44,Fall,1902
i‚Äôd prefer we go after russia next i would like to get a few more fleet builds and create an opening to position myself better against england before making that move and this way we can remain coordinated,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,45,Fall,1902
understood  hopefully we can make that well coordinated i‚Äôll have to know i‚Äôm safe to turn my back on italy  i doubt you‚Äôll get a chance to build another fleet without signaling a stab frankly  ifwhen you do it it‚Äôll probably need to be a ‚Äúfall turn stab for bel or nwy or bre build a fleet with that build‚Äù kind of stab  no england with a brain would look at a german ally building a third fleet as any ally worth keeping around,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,46,Fall,1902
yeah i get that now it‚Äôs just a matter of timing it between who else i‚Äôm attacking and when a stab is available don‚Äôt want to overextend myself and end up trapped by england and whoever else we were just working against,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,47,Fall,1902
hey there  1 new build and 1 rebuild  whats the plan with those  any directions you are thinking about for what should happen with our neighbors  italyenglandrussia  is it time for us to work together or go back to back and dont work together but pointing opposite directions me attacking italy or russia you attacking england  not sure whether you want to coordinate or not let me know,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,48,Winter,1902
hey sorry busy weekend i don‚Äôt think this is the turn for me to attack england don‚Äôt know my plans yet though what about you,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,49,Spring,1903
if you‚Äôre not going after england i can‚Äôt imagine there‚Äôs a better time than now for bal c kielvn berpru munsil given that it locks war in the fall and gives a strong play for mos  but don‚Äôt do that it‚Äôd only leave rum and sev for me üòâ,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,50,Spring,1903
after i didn‚Äôt hear back about where all those armies were going i worried it might be towards me so i covered a hole in my defenses no offense intended if you want to coordinate with me just let me know and we can see what works,0,True,0,austria,germany,10,51,Spring,1903
i do not plan on attacking you can you move back away this turn i can‚Äôt use some units to attack other countries if they need to be positioned to defend against you,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,52,Fall,1903
i would appreciate if you could respond soon we can stay together as central powers,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,53,Winter,1903
i‚Äôm not attacking you  but i had to move my armies into a position where they didn‚Äôt scare my more vulnerable neighbors  i had to either straight out attack russia or italy and i‚Äôm not the sort to get into a war without a solid plan with an ally going with me  are you and england working together against russia  or are you just devoting a little extra resources to hold russia back  i asked you last season what the coordinated plan was but you either didn‚Äôt want to share or needed to go it alone at first which is fine but if we want to avoid slowing each other down we need to talk about it even if we‚Äôre not attacking the same person at the same time you know,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,54,Winter,1903
if you want to do full out war with russia do you need my help or will england‚Äôs be enough  i don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be successful just by yourself  but i could instead slide south to attack italy who is another central power but if i do that i wouldn‚Äôt have enough resources to also head north with you,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,55,Winter,1903
got it thanks let‚Äôs come up with a plan an coordinate after the builds,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,56,Winter,1903
so i understand it may take a season or two to ensure we have a safe way of collaborating if i propose a plan now you may not trust ill do it and have to tell me youll do it but then protect yourself instead  id prefer to have a plan where we both agree on what can work even if it means being a little slower  for example you might say i have to sit here and doublesupport munich to make sure i dont lose it but we can work together once i see im not under threat  just dont take too long or even im going to have to push back at you for this season but as soon as you can move into galicia we can attack russia together from there  im open to suggestions,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,57,Spring,1904
one other option given the builds which happened russia built a northern fleet so if you wanted we could go in a different direction than attacking them  i could go south and attack italy and you and russia could attack england together  just keeping options open,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,58,Spring,1904
thanks you i would like to rebuild trust,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,59,Spring,1904
i will be holding in mun and moving to sil can you support ber to sil,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,60,Spring,1904
maybe you could move vieadr,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,61,Spring,1904
venadr definitely makes sense as does your move to sil  i can move to gal as well,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,62,Spring,1904
thank you glad to work together again,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,63,Spring,1904
man that sucks why‚Äôd you do that,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,64,Fall,1904
i didnt think theyd actually take it  i really just wanted to make sure italy got into marseille  im sorry about that  obviously if id wanted to attack you i would have done it myself  it should be pretty easy to repair though right,0,True,0,austria,germany,10,65,Fall,1904
of course you could just leave that unit in munich for now where you can keep an eye on it  once you have it surrounded you crush it easily  right now if i dont support warsaw you can get it guaranteed ballvn cuts that support and sil s pruwar gets in if i move gal,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,66,Fall,1904
can you move to gal,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,67,Fall,1904
i‚Äôm in gal already what do you mean,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,68,Fall,1904
sorry are you moving gal is what i meant to ask,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,69,Fall,1904
you mean can i move gal so you know it‚Äôs not supporting war,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,70,Fall,1904
yeah what is your plan for that unit,1,,0,germany,austria,10,71,Fall,1904
i was going to cover bud because part of the reason i had to make moves dangerous for you was because russia is all around me right now and i need to get them not focused on taking 23 of my centers  once they are not totally hovering over me i‚Äôm more safe to actually counterattack,0,True,0,austria,germany,10,72,Fall,1904
ok we‚Äôll see after this turn i suppose,1,True,0,germany,austria,10,73,Fall,1904
gal can cover bud alb can cover ser was some of what i‚Äôm doing to make sure i‚Äôm less likely to get smashed,1,True,0,austria,germany,10,74,Fall,1904
hello russia would you like to work together,1,True,-1,germany,russia,10,0,Spring,1901
greeting good sir kaiser  an alliance would sound good to me how about the old warsaw pact of 1901 dmz in prussia silesia and bohemia,0,True,1,russia,germany,10,1,Spring,1901
agreed,1,True,-1,germany,russia,10,2,Spring,1901
can you help me verify some information and see if i can trust the chain of people i have received information from what are you and turkey‚Äôs plan for the black sea,1,True,-1,germany,russia,10,3,Spring,1901
are plan is to bounce in the black sea,1,True,1,russia,germany,10,4,Spring,1901
hey just want to check in and make sure we‚Äôre still good with the dmz you wanted,1,True,-1,germany,russia,10,5,Fall,1901
yeah sounds good can you sup me into sweden i‚Äôll give you norway if you do,0,True,1,russia,germany,10,6,Fall,1901
hey sorry i didn‚Äôt see that i wasn‚Äôt on all yesterday i‚Äôd like to work with you in the north since i‚Äôm afraid england is good and will have france soon,0,True,0,germany,russia,10,7,Winter,1901
ok sounds good what do you have planned,1,True,0,russia,germany,10,8,Spring,1902
england is moving out of nwy back into the oceans i would like swe what are your thoughts,1,True,0,germany,russia,10,9,Spring,1902
ok sounds good i will give you sweeten but in return can you destroy one of your fleets and build somewhere else that much naval power to the north is scary to stp,1,True,0,russia,germany,10,10,Spring,1902
do you need me to destroy and build somewhere else i want to move it out of the area england was afraid of the same reasons and will be less suspicious if i move it in rather than rebuild it,1,True,0,germany,russia,10,11,Spring,1902
yeah that works,1,True,0,russia,germany,10,12,Spring,1902
supporting you into sweeden,1,True,0,russia,germany,10,13,Spring,1902
cool appreciate the help,1,,0,germany,russia,10,14,Spring,1902
how did you not get sweden last round i suped you in,1,True,0,russia,germany,10,15,Fall,1902
i was positioning to get ready for england thanks i‚Äôll get it this turn though,0,True,0,germany,russia,10,16,Fall,1902
you‚Äôre closing in on turkey very quickly how are your relations with austria,1,True,1,germany,russia,10,17,Winter,1902
almost as good as ours it will be interesting to see who gets what in turkey,1,True,-1,russia,germany,10,18,Spring,1903
good have you predetermined the division of turkey at all,1,True,1,germany,russia,10,19,Spring,1903
ha not much yet whats your move for the year are you stabbing england,0,True,-1,russia,germany,10,20,Spring,1903
yeah same with france france wants to give their centers away to england so i do not think this is the turn to stab if they‚Äôre about to gain centers so easily i‚Äôll let you know when i have my moves planned,1,True,1,germany,russia,10,21,Spring,1903
congrats on your progress into france looks like you have as good a shot on paris as england or france with england sailing back north i wanted to ask you to reconsider your allegiances since i predicted your stab into my territory i suggest we get back on good terms vs you continuing your attack which will be a lot less fruitful without your control of lvn  we would make a good team with you going northwest and me going southwest,0,True,-1,russia,germany,10,22,Spring,1903
hello russia i would like to discuss the reconsideration of alliances are you willing to commit to going against austria,1,True,1,germany,russia,10,23,Fall,1903
i am considering that austria might be the strongest power on the board at the moment it looks like they could probably keep that momentum unless they meet resistance from more than one of us,1,False,0,germany,russia,10,24,Winter,1903
yeah austria is looking pretty strong what are you thinking for 1904,1,True,0,russia,germany,10,25,Spring,1904
i think we start moving on austria i need to have austria thinking i‚Äôm not going to attack them so i‚Äôll probably hold mun and not do much else near them maybe move in france too,1,True,0,germany,russia,10,26,Spring,1904
will you let me move lvn back to pru,1,True,0,germany,russia,10,27,Spring,1904
sounds good yeah i made sure you got prussia üëå,1,True,0,russia,germany,10,28,Fall,1904
i know we might be a bit at odds right now but i dont particularly like you getting attacked from two sides so i thought id let you know that ska is moving to take den this fall,1,True,0,russia,germany,10,29,Fall,1905
thanks are you still planning on attacking me or just letting me know about the second attack,1,,0,germany,russia,10,30,Fall,1905
greetings germany apologies for my previous string of betrayals austria had now in turn betrayed me which leaves me pretty far out of the game like you are as well unless im mistaken i propose that i support you into nwy from sweden to cause a little chaos and prevent the seemingly eminent austriaengland win,1,True,0,russia,germany,10,31,Fall,1908
hello russia good to hear from you excuse my ignorance but how would austriaengland win if the game ends after 1910 winter,1,,0,germany,russia,10,32,Fall,1908
hey england and i have agreed not to attack you anymore i have gotten to where i can just defend and we would prefer if we can allow you to focus on defending moscow for the rest of the game,1,True,3,germany,russia,10,33,Spring,1909
hey germany would you like to work together,1,True,0,england,germany,10,0,Spring,1901
yes i‚Äôd like to work together can you let me know what your regional alliances are besides me,1,,0,germany,england,10,1,Spring,1901
currently france and i are keeping the channel clear and for 1901 only we aren‚Äôt building fleets in brest or liverpool  i‚Äôve asked russia not to go north and am trying to convince italy to not hit france  my preference is to work with you over france longterm because you can build armies while i build fleets ensuring neither of us can effectively stab the other,1,True,0,england,germany,10,2,Spring,1901
to work with you i‚Äôd ask that you don‚Äôt build f kie in 1901 and that you let me have belgium at some point before 1904,1,,0,england,germany,10,3,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm good with that plan similarly i‚Äôd rather ally with you over france but will be needing to discuss nonaggression for the moment with france,1,True,0,germany,england,10,4,Spring,1901
i can hold off on building fleets initially,1,True,0,germany,england,10,5,Spring,1901
is your initial plan to move north or toward france,1,True,0,germany,england,10,6,Spring,1901
if you can please try to convince austria and italy to pursue the lepanto italy going west at the start fractures the west to the point that we can‚Äôt do much without incorporating italy into our alliance and italy doesn‚Äôt strike me as an experienced player,1,True,0,england,germany,10,7,Spring,1901
1901 is just norway beyond that i‚Äôm thinking france unless am opportunistic stp presents itself,1,True,0,england,germany,10,8,Spring,1901
are you planning on hitting bur right out of the gate if so i might need to adjust my plans,1,True,0,england,germany,10,9,Spring,1901
i have briefly talked to both italy and austria in my direct interests only i will try to convince italy east is ideal,1,True,0,germany,england,10,10,Spring,1901
ok i am fine with your northern plans i haven‚Äôt heard enough from russia yet to exchange anything of use there,1,True,0,germany,england,10,11,Spring,1901
not sure about bur yet can you share what your plans would be depending on what i do with that army,1,True,0,germany,england,10,12,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm thinking i‚Äôll get back to you i‚Äôm putting my kid to bed soon,1,True,0,england,germany,10,13,Spring,1901
if you order f kie  den and either a mun  ruh  a ber  mun or a mun  bur  a ber  kie  then i can swap to  f lon  ec f edi  nth a yor  wal,1,True,0,england,germany,10,14,Spring,1901
so basically a southern english opening  either a pure anschluss or rhineland,1,True,0,england,germany,10,15,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm thinking f kie  den a mun  ruh a ber  mun i‚Äôll let you know if there are any changes but right now i‚Äôm unsure about italy‚Äôs intentions,1,True,0,germany,england,10,16,Spring,1901
i would like to take bel in 1901 if possible are you for sure going against france,1,True,0,england,germany,10,17,Spring,1901
i thought you wanted it before 1904 i‚Äôd prefer if i got belgium initially and then could move on to france while giving belgium to you at a later time would you be ok with that,1,True,0,germany,england,10,18,Spring,1901
if i can take it in 1901 i‚Äôd prefer that so that i can put out a navy that can break into mao without losing ec  we each get 5 if we split germany den hol swe par mar england nrwy bel bre sp por  this split also puts my navy away from you and pushes you towards armies which is more sustainable longterm  i said before 1904 because it is possible that france will order a par  pic  a mar  bur or some other combination of moves that makes it near impossible for us to take bel in 1901,1,True,0,england,germany,10,19,Spring,1901
what do you think,1,True,0,england,germany,10,20,Spring,1901
this is a partnership and i would prefer to treat it that way,1,True,0,england,germany,10,21,Spring,1901
ok i can agree to all of that sounds like a plan,1,True,0,germany,england,10,22,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm set to hit france  what have you heard from russia about up north,1,True,0,england,germany,10,23,Spring,1901
i have an idea you tell france that i england am being super rude and making all sorts of demands and you would rather not work with me but you need france to support you germany into bel because i‚Äôm convoying there and you need to build f kie  depending on france‚Äôs response we hit some combination of bel hol and bre  what do you think,1,True,0,england,germany,10,24,Fall,1901
scratch that,1,True,0,england,germany,10,25,Fall,1901
i want to hear france and italy‚Äôs reactions before we make plans for this season i think it could help us be more efficient if we can use that to guess correctly,1,True,0,germany,england,10,26,Fall,1901
france told me you had ec as dmz and i wasn‚Äôt openly aggressive so i‚Äôll pretend like i‚Äôm going to side with them to get their orders,1,True,0,germany,england,10,27,Fall,1901
france told me you had ec as dmz and i wasn‚Äôt openly aggressive so i‚Äôll pretend like i‚Äôm going to side with them to get their orders,1,True,0,germany,england,10,28,Fall,1901
ok,1,True,0,england,germany,10,29,Fall,1901
any thoughts,1,True,0,england,germany,10,30,Fall,1901
france is expecting you to move to brest where do you think we should move,1,True,0,germany,england,10,31,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm hitting bel you could go bur and hol,1,True,0,england,germany,10,32,Fall,1901
yeah i can do that,1,True,0,germany,england,10,33,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm thinking two fleets for me will you hold off on building a fleet this year,1,True,0,england,germany,10,34,Winter,1901
sure i can do that this turn,1,,0,germany,england,10,35,Winter,1901
if you can put your fleets on the west so you can get around spain and put pressure there that‚Äôd be great especially because france is all armies on the main area,1,True,0,germany,england,10,36,Winter,1901
and the we can talk about plans up north after builds,1,True,0,germany,england,10,37,Winter,1901
as long as russia doesn‚Äôt build a stp or f stpnc my plan for 1902 is to move into mao via irish ec and nwgs with one fleet in nth i might be able to convoy you into pic,1,True,0,england,germany,10,38,Winter,1901
i‚Äôve been talking to some people about russia and since i bounced them in sweden and they don‚Äôt believe my excuse i think i need to build a fleet to take to bal,0,True,0,germany,england,10,39,Winter,1901
can you live with that i won‚Äôt be able to make use of another army right now against france anyways,1,True,0,germany,england,10,40,Winter,1901
if you build in ber,1,True,0,england,germany,10,41,Spring,1902
i think we can lock up the north now what do you want to do for france,1,True,0,germany,england,10,42,Spring,1902
i can hold in hol so you can convoy that army somewhere in the fall i can support bel to bur while i move bur to gas,1,True,0,germany,england,10,43,Spring,1902
if russia moves to pru you might have a problem if you hold a hol  what do you think about a bel  pic a bur s a bel  pic a mun s a bur h a hol  kie,1,True,0,england,germany,10,44,Spring,1902
i don‚Äôt think i need to worry about pru austria is pretty strong on russia‚Äôs south west,1,True,0,germany,england,10,45,Spring,1902
the rest looks good though if you‚Äôre good with that plan still thinking about what to do with hol but that doesn‚Äôt really affect you so much,1,True,0,germany,england,10,46,Spring,1902
what are you doing with your norway fleet,1,True,0,germany,england,10,47,Spring,1902
f nrwy  nwgs,1,True,0,england,germany,10,48,Spring,1902
ok i‚Äôm moving a hol  kie,1,True,0,germany,england,10,49,Spring,1902
what are your plans,1,True,0,england,germany,10,50,Fall,1902
i‚Äôm thinking a burmar if i can get italy on board a munbur what do you want to do,1,True,0,germany,england,10,51,Fall,1902
what are your plans,1,True,0,germany,england,10,52,Fall,1902
i am trying to get italy to support me burmar but they think par will be supporting bre rather than cutting my support from burmar anything you could say to them to convince them to support me into mar,1,True,0,germany,england,10,53,Fall,1902
i‚Äôll try to think of something to say,1,True,0,england,germany,10,54,Fall,1902
thanks,1,True,0,germany,england,10,55,Fall,1902
i don‚Äôt really know what to tell him that would convince him to support you in he‚Äôs in the better support position but he has to realize that he needs the center more than he needs france dead,1,True,0,england,germany,10,56,Fall,1902
you have any ideas,1,True,0,england,germany,10,57,Fall,1902
burgas munbur and then i can take it myself next year,1,True,0,germany,england,10,58,Fall,1902
any thoughts what are your plans,1,True,0,germany,england,10,59,Fall,1902
scratch that last plan italy is going to support me into mar,1,True,0,germany,england,10,60,Fall,1902
what are you doing,1,True,0,germany,england,10,61,Fall,1902
sorry my birthday is today and i was at dinner,1,True,0,england,germany,10,62,Fall,1902
i think i‚Äôm going to shoot for bre just in case it‚Äôs open if i‚Äôm bounced in mao then that means france won‚Äôt be getting a center,1,True,0,england,germany,10,63,Fall,1902
happy birthday hope it‚Äôs been a good one,1,True,0,germany,england,10,64,Fall,1902
yeah that plan is what i was thinking too,1,True,0,germany,england,10,65,Fall,1902
what‚Äôs your next move i think if you generally swing around spain toward italy while i work on russia in the north we can finish off france and move on to our next targets,1,True,0,germany,england,10,66,Winter,1902
i agree i‚Äôd rather you didn‚Äôt build another fleet right now would that be ok,1,True,0,england,germany,10,67,Winter,1902
yeah sorry i didn‚Äôt respond before adjudication but that was my plan figured you wouldn‚Äôt want me to build fleets,1,True,0,germany,england,10,68,Spring,1903
in return for me not having fleets could you avoid nth,1,True,0,germany,england,10,69,Spring,1903
i‚Äôd like to discuss who we can attack next as well since france is on the ropes,1,True,0,germany,england,10,70,Spring,1903
i‚Äôll move f edi  nwgs then nrwy i‚Äôm keeping f bel there in case france retreats  i say we‚Äôre close to stabbing italy and austria russia is not in a position to fight back and never will be with turkey so messed up what do you think,1,True,0,england,germany,10,71,Spring,1903
i was thinking maybe i take on russia and you work towards italy it will be a little longer of a route for you but will help you secure the west,1,True,0,germany,england,10,72,Spring,1903
would you mind leaving stp open until i take it having only one unit bordering nrwy would help keep things stable,1,True,0,england,germany,10,73,Spring,1903
so like don‚Äôt go to stp,1,True,0,germany,england,10,74,Spring,1903
what are your plans for this turn,1,True,0,germany,england,10,75,Spring,1903
i‚Äôm setting myself up for iberia  if you take stp i‚Äôd very much prefer that you did it by taking stpsc instead of using an army that way we can maintain stability in the north,1,True,0,england,germany,10,76,Spring,1903
can i have your support into paris i‚Äôd also like to ask how we were planning on dividing france so as to keep things balanced,1,True,0,germany,england,10,77,Fall,1903
i thought we discussed you get par and mar and i get bre  the iberian  can you take mar instead,1,True,0,england,germany,10,78,Fall,1903
what are you planning on this turn,1,True,0,england,germany,10,79,Fall,1903
what‚Äôs the deal with austria,1,True,0,england,germany,10,80,Fall,1903
if i get par and mar can you not support me from bre,1,True,0,germany,england,10,81,Fall,1903
need to talk to austria but they‚Äôre claiming defensive positioning after not responding in time to messages,1,True,0,germany,england,10,82,Fall,1903
please don‚Äôt take stp with an army,1,True,0,england,germany,10,83,Fall,1903
i‚Äôm not planning on it and i really doubt i‚Äôd be able to with russia picking up 2 centers in turkey,1,True,0,germany,england,10,84,Fall,1903
oh i missed that is austria going to start sniping italy,1,True,0,england,germany,10,85,Fall,1903
im talking with them but unsure right now i got myself in a bind when i fell asleep the other night when negotiating with austria and they moved toward me i hope they‚Äôll draw back and choose to go after russia or italy next but i doubt it‚Äôll be russia based on their collaboration to finish turkey off faster,1,True,0,germany,england,10,86,Fall,1903
yeah i think we can hold against russia with what we have up there austria might be tricky,1,True,0,england,germany,10,87,Fall,1903
can you keep moving fleets toward the mediterranean after france falls to prepare for fighting austria i have a feeling italy will fall soon after france unless austria just chooses another target,1,True,1,germany,england,10,88,Winter,1903
i‚Äôll move some but i need to keep a couple back to keep you honest and maintain control of nth this is why i‚Äôve been so pushy about your fleet production and keeping armies out of stpfin if you don‚Äôt build fleets then i don‚Äôt have to keep people in the rear,1,True,-1,england,germany,10,89,Winter,1903

and austria is about to smack mun which is unfortunate  should i go ahead and dump a fleet into stp so that you can take mos,1,True,-1,england,germany,10,91,Winter,1903

because a ruh currently be displaced what do you think about ordering a bur  mun to cut potential mun support instead of a bur s a ruh,1,True,5,england,germany,10,139,Spring,1907
makes perfect sense to me updated my orders,1,True,-5,germany,england,10,140,Spring,1907
we have to manage russia‚Äôs collapse austria stabbing is great but we need to be careful,1,True,5,england,germany,10,141,Fall,1907
ok let me know if you have any suggestions for what i should do,1,True,-5,germany,england,10,142,Fall,1907
if i were in your shoes i‚Äôd hold f ber and then use a ruh and a bur to support a kie  mun austria stabbed russia you might be able to take mun back and rebuild your armies  separately would you please support a nrwy  fin,1,True,5,england,germany,10,143,Fall,1907
i will support that plan works for me fingers crossed,1,True,-5,germany,england,10,144,Fall,1907

i‚Äôm struggling with how to handle ber bal mun and fin any ideas,1,True,3,england,germany,10,146,Spring,1908

yeah i‚Äôll probably lose ber but that sounds about as good as i could figure out too,1,True,-3,germany,england,10,148,Spring,1908
chat is back up and my orders are in,1,True,3,england,germany,10,149,Fall,1908
we need to be careful with austria because he is close to at least 2 stalemate lines  position 1 httpukdiplomorgpouchonlinestalematesatoystaleiiihtm  part ii position 1 httpukdiplomorgpouchonlinestalematesatoysouthernprogressivehtm,1,True,3,england,germany,10,150,Fall,1908
ok so those are their positions and what recommendations on their orders let me know if you have any ideas to prevent it,1,True,-3,germany,england,10,151,Fall,1908
to slow him down i think you need to contest boh i know that means you might lose berlin but you can always destroy it build an army in kie  if we can keep him out of boh then he‚Äôll have to do a bunch of shuffling towards turkey and we‚Äôll have a better chance of taking moscow,1,True,3,england,germany,10,152,Fall,1908
i think we need you to get your armies to the front in austria are you going to have boh hold while being supported,1,True,4,england,germany,10,153,Spring,1909
i think this is what i‚Äôll do with the austrian front it‚Äôll cut any support from the adjacent countries a ber  sil a boh  vie a mun  tar,1,True,-4,germany,england,10,154,Spring,1909
any suggestions,1,True,-4,germany,england,10,155,Spring,1909
i‚Äôve told russia that i‚Äôm not advancing anymore because austria becomes invincible if he takes moscow he might be open to working with us in exchange for survival,1,True,4,england,germany,10,156,Spring,1909
ok i‚Äôll message them in the morning a similar thing,1,True,-4,germany,england,10,157,Spring,1909
russia is not entering orders we need to get to moscow now,1,True,4,england,germany,10,158,Fall,1909
are you moving ber to pru you might need all of the support to do it,1,True,4,england,germany,10,159,Fall,1909
i think we‚Äôd be better off if you supported moscow holding we aren‚Äôt in a position to take it,1,True,-4,germany,england,10,160,Fall,1909
hello turkey would you be interested in a information sharing agreement there shouldn‚Äôt be any direct conflict between us anytime soon but you can probably get information out of france and england better that me due to location,1,True,0,germany,turkey,10,0,Spring,1901
hello i would be happy to accept this agreement,1,True,0,turkey,germany,10,1,Spring,1901
great to hear how is your relationship with russia plans for black sea,1,True,0,germany,turkey,10,2,Spring,1901

hello   could i expect a peace from my east,1,True,0,france,germany,10,0,Spring,1901
yes you can expect peace from the east,1,True,0,germany,france,10,1,Spring,1901
can you confirm the same for me,1,True,0,germany,france,10,2,Spring,1901
sure i can lets keep bur dmz and do not move there,1,True,0,france,germany,10,3,Spring,1901
ok agreed,1,True,0,germany,france,10,4,Spring,1901
would you be interested in an adventure south,1,True,0,france,germany,10,5,Spring,1901
i‚Äôm not opposed i‚Äôm trying to convince italy to lepanto so maybe if you and i could hold of on appearing aggressive towards italy they could shift their focus on the eastern med,1,True,0,germany,france,10,6,Spring,1901
do you have any plans with england or know of england‚Äôs plans,1,True,0,germany,france,10,7,Spring,1901
for italy id like to have you press him to go east  with england i do have a dmz agreed,1,True,0,france,germany,10,8,Spring,1901
working on italy i‚Äôll let you know when i know for sure,1,False,0,germany,france,10,9,Spring,1901
hey england is being very aggressive what do you think they‚Äôre going to do,1,True,0,germany,france,10,10,Fall,1901
i find your moves interesting yes england is hostile to me and if you join him im out but if you join me we can successfully defend the mainland while taking out italy more centers and then after english centers are easy grab,1,True,0,france,germany,10,11,Fall,1901
i can explain my reasoning if that helps f kieden is obvious choice in my opinion to get a center and get involved in the north a munruh is still in agreement with what we discussed and gives me a little say on hollandbelgium a bermun was mostly as a deterrent to italy from attacking austria and a little bit vice versa,1,True,0,germany,france,10,12,Fall,1901
i‚Äôve had a neutral enough opening want me to ask england anything to try to predict their moves,1,True,0,germany,france,10,13,Fall,1901
i see but if you moved into tyr italy could be done until 1903 especially if austria joins,1,False,0,france,germany,10,14,Fall,1901
no need england is probably going for brest,1,True,0,france,germany,10,15,Fall,1901
ok i‚Äôm not so sure about attacking italy though let me talk to austria and get back to you i won‚Äôt give away anything you‚Äôve told me,1,True,0,germany,france,10,16,Fall,1901
still interested in attacking italy or no,1,True,0,germany,france,10,17,Fall,1901
definitely not anymore,1,True,-1,france,germany,10,18,Winter,1901
i will surrender to england with only one center to survive,1,True,-1,france,germany,10,19,Fall,1902
is there a reason you‚Äôve chosen to surrender to england,1,True,1,germany,france,10,20,Fall,1902
italy and i have discussed things and would rather rebuild you and push back on england together if you‚Äôre interested in not surrendering,1,False,3,germany,france,10,21,Winter,1902
he is stronger so he can protect me better if you do intend to do so please move back from my lands,1,True,-3,france,germany,10,22,Winter,1902
working out the plan but yes that is the intention will you commit to working with us,1,False,3,germany,france,10,23,Spring,1903
how do you intend to fight england with all those armies,1,True,-3,france,germany,10,24,Spring,1903
strong alliances and putting myself at risk but i think with your help we can limit any gains england could get this turn and i could get 2 builds if they take you this turn it‚Äôs probably all over,1,False,3,germany,france,10,25,Spring,1903
i have italy committed to helping with their fleets and not attacking you or me i have austria on board with a non aggression agreement and i am discussing terms with russia you are the final piece to the puzzle i‚Äôd really like your help,1,False,3,germany,france,10,26,Spring,1903
really,1,True,-3,france,germany,10,27,Spring,1903
yeah but if i can‚Äôt get you on board this plan will be scrapped and i‚Äôll need something else if they can add 2 centers while i take 2 that‚Äôs isn‚Äôt worth the risk of turning on my strongest ally,1,False,3,germany,france,10,28,Spring,1903
and you have built all the armies and dare to ask me to join your plan while italy is keeping his mouth shut thats why england is getting my centers,1,True,-3,france,germany,10,29,Spring,1903
which center is england letting you keep,1,True,3,germany,france,10,30,Spring,1903
not something i wish to share,1,True,-3,france,germany,10,31,Spring,1903
hello russia  i‚Äôm curious as to how you like to play this game  i‚Äôm often a big fan of the ar alliance turkey is a great initial target germany second with italy coming next after that for me and england next for you  lots of possibilities  any thoughts,1,,-1,austria,russia,10,0,Spring,1901
greeings austria  i agree the old jug is a little obvious i do believe that ar is a lot more flexible for both of us    how do you envision a 1901,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,1,Spring,1901
we could bounce in gal as that‚Äôs a fairly safe way to maintain those two units in a rearguard position for starters  then there‚Äôs turkey if i can convince them that you‚Äôre going north so that they can move quickly with their fleets with me ie ankcon then you could just take bla which would speed up this whole endeavor right away  if we don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll do that or you don‚Äôt want to lie in 01 you two could just bounce there and go to mosukr while i go to ser then in the fall you could either take rum with the fleet so you can force bla or else i support you into rum from ukr while going for bla again  of course italy goes trl and ven right out of the gate i won‚Äôt be as useful an ally to you p,1,,-1,austria,russia,10,2,Spring,1901
any thoughts on 1901 moves  germany and italy both seem content to play cautiously so they say the anschluss hold in munich from germany and how about a lepanto from italy and turkey is making friendly sounds but nothing concrete  you feeling like the typical 3 units south approach so we can pick apart turkey i dont seen any obvious eg fighting right out of the gate to give you an easy opening into scandanavia as cool as that would be  ar alliances where r gets in the west early can do some fun things,1,,-1,austria,russia,10,3,Spring,1901
agreed on the bounce in gal yeah if you can convince turkey to move f to con that would be great,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,4,Spring,1901
are you worried that italy will disrupt you this spring,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,5,Spring,1901
italian 1901 moves are a wildcard  i think they want to take it cautious which means i‚Äôd have a tiny bit of breathing room but if you were italy and wanted to dive into austria wouldn‚Äôt you tell them you wanted to move cautiously too p,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,6,Spring,1901
yeah fair what are your 1901 plans then going for serbia and keeping trip defended might be the way to go then,1,,1,russia,austria,10,7,Spring,1901
wow the west looks way more fun than what we‚Äôre all doing,1,,-1,austria,russia,10,8,Fall,1901
ha hows that,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,9,Fall,1901
england gets into the channel with the aggressive convoy from wales option germany puts two on bur and france weirdly decides to launch an army into the east  things will move fast over there,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,10,Fall,1901
of course we could slow things down for them if it starts to look out of hand  and we you especially need to watch a nascent eg alliance  i‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be able to do some fun stuff too üôÇ  we should talk to france so they don‚Äôt crumble too quickly,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,11,Fall,1901
wait dumby question im used to playdip why does the board show some peoples spring moves and not others,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,12,Fall,1901
yeah that germanyenglish alliance is looking pretty formidable looks like we do have an antiturkish italy which could be useful we need france to give eg a fight itd be nice for us to get sweden but im looking pretty outgunned to the north,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,13,Fall,1901
the board shows me everyone‚Äôs moves did you go back a season to see the moves or are you only looking at the current position,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,14,Fall,1901
i see the board now it just showed me everyones moves but turkeys and mine it was weird,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,15,Fall,1901
that is definitely odd,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,16,Fall,1901
at least you have no worries about an english army in nwy right next to stp  how did you want to play rum  tell turkey you‚Äôre supporting your fleet into there and if they stab you by taking bla in the fall you‚Äôll build f sev in the winter to force them right back out  totally valid defensive threat and maybe convinces them to leave ank where it is,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,17,Fall,1901
yeah that would be a good play are you going for the second build in greece not sure how that will play out with italy and turkey im debating whether or not to go for sweden or send my fleet south,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,18,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm definitely going for gre italy can‚Äôt guarantee a build without taking tunis which keeps ion from being involved in gre in any direction  turkey may not feel like letting me have gre but i can support myself in so they can‚Äôt really stop it either,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,19,Fall,1901
yeah you need greece agreed what if i tell turkey that i will sup their bulgarian army into rum which will then free up your army in serbia to actaully support me into rum then your albanian fleet gets greece for free,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,20,Fall,1901
do you think turkey will believe that  we could try but i‚Äôd hate to go for gre unsupported and have turkey decide at the last minute the they don‚Äôt trust you or want to keep me from getting gre  let‚Äôs sound them out and see whether we can tell what they‚Äôre likely to do and go from there,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,21,Fall,1901
sounds good,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,22,Fall,1901
supporting you into rum will show my hand as your ally but that has to happen at some point  if i do that do i have your assurance that in exchange next season youll do rum s serbul so we can squeeze them back into their homeland  well need that to succeed in spring so that in case they get into aeg they cant stop it for the fall,1,,-1,austria,russia,10,23,Fall,1901
hey so let me know what you think about fall plans when you get a chance although i imagine you‚Äôre hopefully having much more fun doing some new year‚Äôs party or something üôÇ,1,,-1,austria,russia,10,24,Fall,1901
looks like we only have 13 hrs until adjudication quick timetable on this game i guess,1,,-1,austria,russia,10,25,Fall,1901
in case you‚Äôre out partying and only read this while i‚Äôm asleep if your good with my offer i support you into rum now you support serbul next season then it‚Äôs a deal  also since you didn‚Äôt ask for any particular plans in the warviegalbohsil region i‚Äôm going to assume a ‚Äúbounceenforceddmz‚Äù of gal is still in effect and we can do that again if you‚Äôre planning instead on poking at germany to remind them to be nice about swe i can instead cover trieste  i could see how f bal  a pru could wreck havoc on a german position where their fleet has landed way up in sweden kie  ber  den sitting kinda wide open  just let me know or else we can stick with another bounce for now,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,26,Fall,1901
yeah sounds good,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,27,Fall,1901
so thats a yes for i get you rum you help support me into bul next season  and lets stay off of germanys doorstep for now fight one war at a time yeah üôÇ,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,28,Fall,1901
and i assume you meant you want support for ukrrum since youre doing sevbla to keep turkey out right  because you didnt actually say which unit you were sending to rum would be very sad to order a support for the wrong unit yknow,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,29,Fall,1901
yeah i‚Äôm not going to poke germany sup my army in moving into bla with my fleet you‚Äôll get bul next season üëçüèª,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,30,Fall,1901
cool thats what i had ordered already but glad to confirm,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,31,Fall,1901
wow im glad i picked you to work with and not turkey  i really hate picking allies who cant get their orders in,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,32,Winter,1901
as a consequence you can build sev and force arm in spring and crush bul at the same time and in fall 02 bulcon ensures that con s ank is cut and bla s armank succeeds and the turk ends 02 on 2 dots,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,33,Winter,1901
seems like you made a bit of a misorder on wargal though  that wasnt intentional was it  i didnt want to be in gal i just wanted it empty  i can try to get out of your way there but its going to be a bit crowded after the builds,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,34,Winter,1901
oh yeah sorry about that i dont know what went wrong yeah i guess try to evacuate that unit so it can actually be useful to us trying to decide whether to build north or south rn,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,35,Winter,1901
want to plan a german offensive it looks like we have a lot of free units that could attack them,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,36,Spring,1902
two fronted war  do we maybe want to pin down turkey so theyre unable to become a threat first pick up one more build from them each  plan for that build in sev then do f bla s sevarm in spring and f bla s sevank in fall  meanwhile rumgre s serbul in spring and in fall i hit bulcon to cut their support so that ank is unsupported in the fall and we get both bulank in one year  one build for each of us turkeys down to 2 centers and cant cause much trouble even behind us and we can turn our attention more easily on germany  we could use our rearguard units to push up on the german line now but to actually break through requires a ton of force we really need trlbohsilpru to ensure we crack munber unless they leave themselves totally undefended  even just 2 armies back there and its slow going and they can pull holkie to fill in another support in one move  im game but it seems maybe a year early,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,37,Spring,1902
oh i didn‚Äôt see they build a fleet in berlin this means they‚Äôll force swe and put pressure on stp unless you can convince them to work with you against england instead  once the push fleets like that they‚Äôll be way out of position and yeah we can crack them  maybe we can afford to push sooner we should consider some tactics i could perhaps be convinced,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,38,Spring,1902
so in theory if we did the whole airhead alliance we could blitz westward all at once now vieboh galsil warpru ventrl  all three of us go after germany now and in the fall we make supported attacks on both munich and berlin  one has to fall and if they arent careful in spring both could in the same year  the problem with that kind of plan is it requires tons of trust for you me and italy  you have to trust me to not dive right in to warsaw as you walk out italy has to trust leaving their entire homeland totally undefended and i have to launch a two front war where my two allies could just coordinate instead walking ventri  tunionalb while you do wargal as im getting out of the way  fun kind of things to do when trust has been built but i dont know yall one bit yet üôÇ,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,39,Spring,1902
so since im not sure i want to commit to jumping all over germany just yet i want to make sure you dont stress about my bored armies my orders will involvee vie h galbud as well as the gre s serbul while you do rum s serbul as well ok  italy will have a unit f eas after this move and will be convoying the army over to peel apart smy and help you into arm to take ank  if you want to leave gal open for now we can keep it as a dmz so you dont need to worry about ukr or anything like that  unless you have any other concrete plans youd prefer to do that is,1,,0,austria,russia,10,40,Spring,1902
yeah i am totally on board for your proposal that gets us one build each this round from turkey i was juts saying we should start moving into germanys territory without making a full attack yet galboh and vietyr could set us up for that next turn as for working with italy that is an option but how much have you been talking with them so far yeah any ideas to the north for retaining stp,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,41,Spring,1902
yeah sounds good to me how will gal move to budapest since theres an army already there also how have negotaitions with italy gone do they expect smy or con,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,42,Spring,1902
galbud budser serbul gre s serbul  the latter succeeds as long as you hold up your end of the bargain and order rum s serbul  you misorder that or forget and i am not able to get out of your way in gal p,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,43,Spring,1902
re consmyank ive talked to italy and theyre going for smy and will support me into con and if you need it you wont by then ill support you into ank  a nice 3way split of turkey,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,44,Spring,1902
ofc im not looking to break our alliance anytime soon xd a dual win is very possible for us,1,False,0,russia,austria,10,45,Spring,1902
re stp  thats tricky  if you send war north to help you hold it which it will for a year or two until they bring all three of those fleets to bear at once youre using the army which wed want to be useful in silpru  as long as you cover stp now they cant take it from you this year  they get swe this year and spring of next year they move into position and then finally in fall they have 23 units in position to take stp  by then we should be able to make them think twice about that either by backing up stp with some army strength or else losing it temporarily while we push against munber on land,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,46,Spring,1902
to your second point im not entirely sure about 2 builds for you one for me and one for italy long term that is could i have con and then give you smy next year that would leave me with 1 more army the you but that seems fair since im a lot more spread,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,47,Spring,1902
re stp yeah ill keep negotiating with eg and if i cant get anywhere with them ill go for the protect stp at all costs i think i might be able to play one against the other though,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,48,Spring,1902
long term we don‚Äôt need italy no  in fact we can probably just take smy from them the very year after they get it if turkey is dead and italy has lots of fleets they‚Äôll be going after france which only strengthens eg further which we don‚Äôt want,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,49,Spring,1902
but as for current plans we already splitting equally i supported you into rum wasn‚Äôt needed but i ordered it and that told turkey i was their enemy that cost me something so you agreed to one season‚Äôs worth of support for me to get bul an even trade  then i‚Äôll make sure to keep tapping con each season to cut support for ank which gets you that one which would mean a fair trade after that is con for me which i won‚Äôt need your support for just your permission that i can take it for myself and we‚Äôre still good  italy taking smy on their own helps both of us because it gets rid of a unit which can support con or ank  once this stuff is done however i‚Äôm open to giving you smy especially if we‚Äôre both moving against germany and splitting munber for the two of us,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,50,Spring,1902
but if you see it differently let me know diplomacy is the name of the game and it‚Äôs not a compromise unless everyone is equally  unhappy üòâ,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,51,Spring,1902
fair  but the one thing for us to consider is if i get to builds this year i can put them to the north and two fleets would be the perfect support for out german invasion in the following year,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,52,Spring,1902
a fleet in the north would be awesome yes  if it looks like we have a chance at making sure that happens i‚Äôm definitely interested in trying to help that become a reality  that totally opens up stalemate lines which otherwise get locked down,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,53,Spring,1902
looks like turkey has to choose this next season block arm or syr  can‚Äôt do both i‚Äôll be in aeg to make sure turkey cracks open totally next year  i‚Äôm moving my armies a little south as well to help them from worrying you üôÇ,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,54,Fall,1902
and yeah you‚Äôre going to need two builds from turkey sooner rather than later  that should be doable pretty quickly,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,55,Fall,1902
in fact i‚Äôm a bit worried about your western border already  if you want to watch your back and send that rumanian army through the gal dmz so that you have two units covering war in case germany thinks about munsil  bal c kiepri  yikes i‚Äôm cool with that if it‚Äôs just passing through for defensive reasons,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,56,Fall,1902
yeah that is a little worrying should i just sup my sev army inot arm again,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,57,Fall,1902
if you want to ensure you own ank at the end of next year i think you need to do that supported attack again yes  if youre worried about germany and want to redeploy west thats fine too but itll make it slower to get you a turkish build,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,58,Fall,1902
if i were you id send the rumanian army to cover your western flank and keep hammering at turkey so you can get builds first ank next year then like we discussed you can have smy well have to steal it from italy which may mean i need to stab them and if i do that i wont be able to simultaneously fight against germany as much with you but we can figure that out when we get to it,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,59,Fall,1902
maybe turkey forgot to order again then they‚Äôll lose all three of their units next season and we‚Äôll be able to get you ank and smy both next year  make sure your orders are submitted just in case,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,60,Fall,1902
awesome the turk chose to defend syria not arm  attacks on con and smy ensure you get ank in spring  good to see england backed off in the north nice diplomatic work on your part üôÇ,1,,0,austria,russia,10,61,Fall,1902
hey things look pretty straightforward in the south we both do supported attacks on ank  con and smy can only support one  the other is destroyed in spring  then in fall whoever got in supports the other attack and we get one build each next year,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,62,Spring,1903
sounds good i plan on moving in on ank what are your orders for bul and greece moving sertrip coould set up a free build from italy this turn as well also any ideas on keepung france around a little longer germand  and england dont seem that close,1,True,-1,russia,austria,10,63,Spring,1903
also ive heard intel that germany is moving on us now i suggest vieboh and bringing your other units north would help us have the perfect counterattack for the following year when we get reinforcements,1,True,-1,russia,austria,10,64,Spring,1903
yeah moving two units back to vie and boh now and i would frankly be very worried if i were you of this f bal c kielvn berpru munsil  that would crack war in one season and put huge pressure mos,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,65,Spring,1903
but if germany does that i‚Äôll be ready to put pressure on them in boh at least,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,66,Spring,1903
are you going to cover against germany too,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,67,Spring,1903
nice save in the north and if turkey messes up in the fall you get both builds from ank and smy in one year  plus i‚Äôm covering your butt by moving to boh so that mun won‚Äôt go to sil so you‚Äôre looking pretty good i‚Äôm going to need that build from con this year to get a second fleet england is coming,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,68,Spring,1903
yeah im glad i got the bounce to the north or id be in real trouble wait i dont think turkey even has to make a mistake if i sup you into con from bla than that prevents con from suping smy from my two pronged attack from ank and arm,1,True,-1,russia,austria,10,69,Spring,1903
if turkey orders conank that cuts support of ank s armsmy  if you attack the other way arm s anksmy you‚Äôll get into smy but conank will recapture ank,1,,1,austria,russia,10,70,Spring,1903
if you do bla s ank ank s armsmy you keep ank but again conank cuts support for your attack on smy,1,,1,austria,russia,10,71,Spring,1903
however aeg s armsmy bla s bulcon is guaranteed now that i look closer  they have no fleets to cut either support now so if we do that then all three turkish centers drop this turn i missed that in my earlier analysis thanks for making me dig into it again,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,72,Spring,1903
can you take a look and make sure i‚Äôm reading the tactics on that correctly,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,73,Spring,1903
yeah thats right we should have the turk out of the game in the winter you have my support from bla into con which guarantees your build but to guarantee mine could you sup army in arm into smy with your aeg fleet bc otherwise turkey has a shot of surviving if he cuts support from ank,1,True,-1,russia,austria,10,74,Fall,1903
aeg s armsmy and bulcon are both already ordered üôÇ,1,,1,austria,russia,10,75,Fall,1903
you should make sure to leave both stp and mos open for your two builds  i‚Äôm building f tri i‚Äôll need it in the mediterranean are you building a northern fleet now while you have a chance,1,,1,austria,russia,10,76,Fall,1903
f tri for me a mos for you so f stpsc to back up your other fleet and keep england happy or f stpnc to get one out up top before you get bottled in,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,77,Winter,1903
sounds about right,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,78,Winter,1903
you decide on whether youll do south coast or north  looks like youve managed to avoid war with england up until now so probably south coast,1,,0,austria,russia,10,79,Winter,1903
yeah prob either south coast or army im thinking an army could be good since i already have one fleet there,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,80,Winter,1903
yeah an army can sneak around in nwyfin easier too,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,81,Winter,1903
ive played this game a long time and i dont remember the last time i saw an ar alliance with both austria and russia building fleets in 1903  that is the sign of an extremely wellfunctioning alliance for primarily landbased powers üôÇ,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,82,Spring,1904
hell yeah man were doing well how should we coordinate the german offensive this year,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,83,Spring,1904
i am going to support france into munich  you should push them back to prussia right  i have a little concern that if they go into sil we will have a hole in our line  galicia  what should we do about that  either i can go there or you can convoy an army from turkey up to rum and go into gal the season after that  either way one of us should transit through gal towards the front lines,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,84,Spring,1904
we can drain our units out of turkey at the same rate so we both are safe over there and get our units where we can make use of them,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,85,Spring,1904
okay sounds good ill pull the  ank army to fill the hole would it be valuable to pull that con army up into the fold also i love the support france into mun play as for ejecting germnays foothold in lvn i think i march from moscow right,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,86,Spring,1904
i will definitely bring con out of  there but do you mind if it waits a season so that we evacuate turkey at the same rate you‚Äôve got 2 units there now and i‚Äôve got 1 after this season it‚Äôll be one each and we can pull them out at the same time  just helps us both worry less about any asymmetry,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,87,Spring,1904
moslvn stp and war supports the move gobbal cuts the possibility of bal s lvn seems like the right set of northern moves,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,88,Spring,1904
re turkey if you want to move faster we could i could move my con out now if you are moving both your armies out ankrum and smyarm,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,89,Spring,1904
so actually i‚Äôm not going to stress about turkey i‚Äôll trust you and move conbul and i suggest you move smyarm to get that into play as well  i think i need to go to gal in case germany goes to sil and also retreats lvnpru you‚Äôll need extra support to hold war if germany has pru  sil and can cut lvn with their fleet,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,90,Spring,1904
i can shuffle gal out of your way so you can get rum in place to support your own unit unless you want me to keep gal there for now  you could bring your other army around and move rumukr  either way if you want to do rumgal let me know and i will move out of the way,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,91,Fall,1904
what are your thoughts  seems like a key season for coordination,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,92,Fall,1904
i think ill move rumgal if your cool shuffling ill start moving smy into the fold as well want to move greece to ion so we have another fleet in the med,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,93,Fall,1904
since were still bringing units up i think i will prob not be making any offensives up north unless you have any ideas,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,94,Fall,1904
yep ill get gal out of the way and let you get up there to support yourself in the push toward berlin  as for moves botbal war s lvnpru lvnpru might succeed if i ask france who owes me a favor to tap sil  or you could counter attack next season after you have gal in place,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,95,Fall,1904
yeah lets push germany out of pru ask france to tap berlin though bc you can tap sil with boh then we can disband pru if im looking at this right,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,96,Fall,1904
i am probably moving aegion to hold england off yes  and good point re silber  im feeling a little exposed in the balkans though  i may need to cover my butt those southern armies  i would hate for our alliance to fall apart because you noticed shiny dots sitting undefended,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,97,Fall,1904
yeah likewise i mean to be fair as long as we dont stab each other i think we have the dual win in the bag at this point which kinda of discourages betrayal what are you thinking as far as covering rn to be fair im relatively exposed too,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,98,Fall,1904
well if im leaving aeg youll have no worries about smy but im looking at bul and ser  hey maybe if youre not doing anything with bla this season we could do grebul blabulec and wed bounce  my dot would be safe and wed keep the good position were in and i wouldnt be any closer to rum so youd still be safe in leaving it for gal,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,99,Fall,1904
im not sure about ser  i guess i wont worry about it because if you stabbed me for it youd have an army sitting all alone in the middle of my territory and would not last long,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,100,Fall,1904
agreed on the bounce although that wont work next season bc i will convoy that last army into the fold,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,101,Fall,1904
should i also ask france for the cut or would it be more effective to leave that to you,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,102,Fall,1904
we can work out a different bounce if we need it or maybe we will be just less entangled and wont need to worry about it then,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,103,Fall,1904
i asked them already,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,104,Fall,1904
and reminded them that their help here is ensuring that their enemy has to enemies pushing on them hard  plus i dont think mun is under threat right now,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,105,Fall,1904
france is tapping berlin so i‚Äôll tap sil and you tap bal and you should be able to crush pru,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,106,Fall,1904
so some thoughts on strategy beyond small tactics we can keep italy working with us for another year but i think if we want to push forward we need yet another fleet each  i could take two dots off of italy next year keep one build for myself and one you could take from me in con  the real key for us long term is to get into bur ruh and fleets in the north,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,107,Fall,1904
you forgot to bounce me in bul  not the end of the world but i didnt want to be in bul  we may need to put off killing italy for a little while  theyre gaining position against england and the more tied up in the south that england is the less ability they have to help you out germany against you in the north  have you thought of offering to support them into sweden  it would be amazing for us if ge started fighting,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,108,Fall,1904
you might want to move your ank army up too mos instead of gal btw if you can cover stp with an army it would free up that fleet to dig in against denswekieber,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,109,Fall,1904
yeah sounds good ill move that ank army up to cover mosstp ill ask england if they want support into swe so should we wait on attacking italy this year or not im not partial either way but i agree that once we do you should give me some of your builds in the back as you gain from italy that way i can have some new fleets to make gains to the north,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,110,Winter,1904
i indeed thinking on holding off on attacking italy this year because they are likely to make progress against england  and yes if we‚Äôre not getting you builds in germany and i am getting builds in italy we need you building in the atlantic which i can‚Äôt do for sure  similarly if i can break through in france and need builds and you‚Äôre getting some in germany  you‚Äôd do the same for me üôÇ,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,111,Winter,1904
spring bohmun cut their use of that for support tri s vietrl vietrl bulgre  you do war s galsil galsil pru s balber  this forces germany to do kie s ber or else berlin falls in spring  if they do hold berlin for spring they lose it in the fall because sil can be the mover while bal cuts kiel and pru supports the move uncuttably  fall we possibly also have the option of asking italy to do marbur which cuts that support and then trlbohsil to take mun  or that can wait for the next season  looking pretty good,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,112,Spring,1905
any thoughts for moves  running out of time lets not lose momentum,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,113,Spring,1905
sounds good yeah ill take sil threaten ber and bring that ank unit north,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,114,Spring,1905
alright well berlin fell quicker than expected im thinking of moving the sev army into mos which should allow me to send my stp fleet to bot,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,115,Fall,1905
i think a quick seizure of scandinavia will prevent britain from saving germany from our ground invasion thats why i think i should move my berlin fleet back out to bal and replace it with my prussian army supported by sil just to make sure then i can move warsaw into prussia to cover that territory,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,116,Fall,1905
i think this line of play is in our best inetrsts but i wanted to run it by you to see if you think either of those moves into the baltic sea seemed to risky,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,117,Fall,1905
lvn is critical yes  and mos  berlin is trickier we can retake the typically hard to capture munich now with berkie marbur silbohtrl work together to force mun,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,118,Fall,1905
if they knew how to play this game they‚Äôd see that coming and do this kie s munber swebal  that would evaporate ber in exchange for losing mun  but to avoid losing the fleet you could shuffle pru out of the way to leave it open for a retreat space  or let them evaporate it and rebuild f stpnc which would totally screw them,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,119,Fall,1905
with a mos f stpnc they are so sunk in scandinavia,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,120,Fall,1905
so we could put your sil army in munich if you‚Äôd like and then berlin is still easy next year yeah i think that‚Äôs best get you munich for the north coast build save pru as a retreat space as well prusil to get out of the way in case ber has to retreat and bal is taken,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,121,Fall,1905
france is on board to do marbur  so we can get you munich and if germany isnt very smart youll have both munich and berlin,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,122,Fall,1905
i‚Äôve already put in orders for boh and trl s silmun,1,True,0,austria,russia,10,123,Fall,1905
sounds good,1,True,0,russia,austria,10,124,Fall,1905
arggggg  i told you to do f stplvn not gob  now you cant build in stp  if youd gone to lvn youd have fleets in ber  lvn  stp and more easily able to protect against england who will bee convoying an army to nwy next season if they have any brains at all,1,,0,austria,russia,10,125,Fall,1905
other than supporting munich do need anything from me this season  i have ideas about the north but ill let you ask if you want any advice üòâ,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,126,Spring,1906
but i cant help myself stp  fin is unlikely to be blocked and then you can do a war s moslvn a moslvn a sevmos a sil s ber  what do you think  too safe  better to make some risks,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,127,Spring,1906
in the south im just putting myself in position to replace italys units while england floods into the med  if you cant get a foothold in scandanavia england will be leading this board in 1910,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,128,Spring,1906
ok thanks i think ill do that sorry for not responding my messages havnt been sending for the last week,1,True,1,russia,austria,10,129,Fall,1906
oh nice  stp open for f stpnc,1,True,-1,austria,russia,10,130,Fall,1906
so england is totally overcommitted in the south and yet cannot break my stalemate line i dont think they understand that though  your new northern fleet is going to be a pain in their butt keeping them pinned down protecting nwy  i have a plan to get you another northern unit but it requires being clever you move blabul and i use my two new armies to dislodge you from there and you retreat off the board and rebuild up in stp maybe south coast this time so you have 3 fleets against germanys 2 and you can capture bal and break through their lines to capture den or kie  other than that the only option is hoping you guess cleverly andor eg screw up  getting you an extra unit up there seems the most efficient and your f bla isnt doing us much good anymore,0,True,1,austria,russia,10,131,Spring,1907
sounds good ill move blabul should i attempt the fin sup stp into nwy,1,True,-1,russia,austria,10,132,Spring,1907
i thought about finstp but then i remembered about coasts fin cant support an attack on nwy its a fleet and can only support an attack on a province it could itself move to so that support is invalid üò¶,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,133,Spring,1907
so id instead go for gob which would force swe s bal and allow you to instead do gob c lvnfin and then you do have a unit which can support an attack on nwy,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,134,Spring,1907
oh hey i forgot  munber  just want support or are you shuffling units around for better placement,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,135,Spring,1907
because if you wanted you could do munber berpru silmun and i can support silmun to make sure you keep it but youd have a spring risk youd lose ber and need to recapture in the fall,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,136,Spring,1907
but if i dont hear from you ill assume you just want support for munich,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,137,Spring,1907
sounds good ill grab bot and i think i will go for the grand shuffle so please support silmun,1,True,-1,russia,austria,10,138,Spring,1907
two supports ordered for silmun,1,,1,austria,russia,10,139,Spring,1907
although looking at the way germany plays  munich is less likely to be attacked than berlin  if you wanted you could just leave it open for a season and do sil s munber  then when germany does bal s kieber you‚Äôll both bounce but you‚Äôll have shuffled ber safely back to pru  then in the fall you can do pru  mun s silber and it‚Äôs 3 vs 2 you get in with the army and can concentrate the fleets on the swefin area  i‚Äôll support whichever you choose though it‚Äôs your risk your choice,1,,1,austria,russia,10,140,Spring,1907
ok im doing rumbul ser s rumbul to get rid of that southern fleet and if you can retake ber rebuild  i think you can crush berlin pru  sil s munber botbal cuts off their retreat  the only way they guess their way out of it is to explicitly run away from ber berbal swe s berbal which would be weird  their fleet getting crushed would really screw them though  youd wreak havoc on kiedenswe if they only had one fleet  the other guess you could do is sil s munber pru s gobbal  if they try to run away and you do that again their fleet is crushed  so i guess you now have a 5050 guess at totally wrecking the german fleet üôÇ,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,141,Fall,1907
ummm please try to at least put in provisional orders next time  kinda wrecks the game for you allies when you nmr ,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,142,Fall,1907
and do remember to disband f bul instead of retreating the rest of our northern line depends on those units existing where they are,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,143,Fall,1907
of course part of this is my fault  apparently my order change to put in double support for mun didn‚Äôt go through it saved the version where i supported silmun ,1,True,1,austria,russia,10,144,Fall,1907
yeah apologies for that one i will not miss another step,1,True,-3,russia,austria,10,145,Winter,1907
if you do gob s prubal warpru  sil s warpru and they work germany will be pretty toast,1,True,3,austria,russia,10,146,Winter,1907
let me know what you want boh  trl to do you can clearly retake mun or ber,1,True,3,austria,russia,10,147,Spring,1908
im sending pru to bal and war to prussia so probably cant take ber or mun this season,1,True,-3,russia,austria,10,148,Spring,1908
ok sounds good  make sure to use gob to support prubal in that case,1,True,3,austria,russia,10,149,Spring,1908
ah i would be pretty mad about the stab but i did kind deserve it with that missed set of orders last year are you splitting with germany or england if its both ill prob just surrender,1,True,-3,russia,austria,10,150,Fall,1908
we could probably end the game as a 3way tie ega at the end of the year  sorry about the stab i had gotten kinda bogged down and we were running out of time  in a non time limited game i would‚Äôve been more patient our ar position was still better,1,,3,austria,russia,10,151,Fall,1908
did england say stupid shit to piss you off i‚Äôd have thought you‚Äôd disband the fleets and slam into me to ‚Äúpunish my stab‚Äù  not that i‚Äôm complaining  if you care i‚Äôm happy to support your last unit or two to survive the game at the end so that england can‚Äôt have the satisfaction of eliminating you,1,True,8,austria,russia,10,152,Spring,1909
ha no my thought process after a stab is more survival than revenge yeah that would be sick which units do you want to keep alive,1,True,-8,russia,austria,10,153,Spring,1909
they cant take a mos without my help if either you or i are in warsaw,1,True,8,austria,russia,10,154,Spring,1909
so depending on how we get there if it turns out you have both great  if it turns out that i have war and sevukr underneath ill be supporting you in mos and hoping you use that unit to support war,1,,8,austria,russia,10,155,Spring,1909

nothing from italy other than hello,1,True,0,england,austria,10,5,Spring,1901
can you do me a favor and see if he seems interested in a egi pileon to f  you don‚Äôt need to commit to anything but if he doesn‚Äôt seem interested then it means he‚Äôs coming after me  and having austria collapse early does nothing to help england‚Äôs mid game you know  just means there‚Äôs probably a huge russia and  or italy on the board,1,True,0,austria,england,10,6,Spring,1901
i‚Äôd rather not have italy dabbling in france because the west gets crowded much more quickly than the east there are more centers in the east than the west  italy doing a lepanto to turkey‚Äôs south is a fairly standard opening that keeps austria and italy neutral with each other,1,True,0,england,austria,10,7,Spring,1901

i‚Äôve heard from germany he says you‚Äôve offered him an alliance and i encouraged him to take it if he gets trustworthy vibes from you for what it‚Äôs worth eg is preferable to me given that it keeps russia in check,1,True,0,austria,england,10,11,Spring,1901
as for the lepanto it‚Äôs up to italy if he wants to go that route  i‚Äôd be fine going after turkey with him but if he‚Äôs impatient that quickly turns into ‚Äúi‚Äôm bored waiting for my second build i‚Äôll go after trieste now‚Äù if you know what i mean,1,True,0,austria,england,10,12,Spring,1901

yeah if only pic wasn‚Äôt there wasn‚Äôt expecting pie to happen but that‚Äôs a definite plus for germany,1,True,0,england,austria,10,14,Fall,1901
pic is fine  they have some guesswork to do take the build from por and cover bre with pic risking your convoy to pic or you just walking into mao with them having no open center to build another atlantic fleet or else forgo a 1901 build and self bounce in bre leaving you looking like a genius if you guess right and support picbre leaving them both without a build and way out of position lots of options for you but no no guarantees i suppose,1,True,0,austria,england,10,15,Fall,1901
yeah it‚Äôs all mind games and i can‚Äôt participate in them directly,1,True,0,england,austria,10,16,Fall,1901
yeah not much luck they‚Äôll listen to your suggestions at this point üòâ,1,True,0,austria,england,10,17,Fall,1901
would you mind offering france some advice under the guise of trying to keep the west together longer,1,True,0,england,austria,10,18,Fall,1901
to be honest i‚Äôve reached out but gotten radio silence from day one from them  ¬Ø„ÉÑ¬Ø  i‚Äôll keep trying though,1,True,0,austria,england,10,19,Fall,1901
1 point out that england can force belgium  2 point out that germany won‚Äôt give up a second build for a guaranteed burgundy  3 point out that a bounce in bur ie a pic  bur  a mun  bur bounces a wal  pic  4 losing bre is unlikely because of the guaranteed bel and even if france loses it they won‚Äôt have to destroy and will be able to move a mar  a pic into place next year,1,True,0,england,austria,10,20,Fall,1901
scratch that just advise france to bounce bur because germany won‚Äôt use two,1,True,0,england,austria,10,21,Fall,1901
i could try either kind of suggestion but aren‚Äôt they more likely to worry about what you do than what germany does  how about this i‚Äôll try to get some idea about which way they‚Äôre most concerned with before i suggest which way to go and then check in with you  if they never respond to my messages well that‚Äôs also an indication they‚Äôre not so great at this game and you can go for whatever attack a n00b wouldn‚Äôt see coming üòâ,0,True,0,austria,england,10,22,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm trying to get russia to point out belgium because russia and i are clearly at least at peace with our openings you‚Äôre naturally close to germany and will have more info on that front,1,True,0,england,austria,10,23,Fall,1901
two seemingly separate pieces of info that form a cohesive story when joined might create a stronger narrative in france‚Äôs head,1,True,0,england,austria,10,24,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm just spitballing if you disagree please let me know so that i can orchestrate a cohesive front of information,1,,0,england,austria,10,25,Fall,1901
indeed this is a good point as long as france isn‚Äôt ignoring all inbound messages and wasting our glorious diplomatic efforts p,1,True,0,austria,england,10,26,Fall,1901
he was chatting with me a good bit before the turn germany just made a better argument closer to the deadline,1,True,0,england,austria,10,27,Fall,1901
ah ok maybe just skiing today or something some of us do have lives i suppose  not me but some of us üò¶,1,True,0,austria,england,10,28,Fall,1901
i‚Äôm happy to pass on your suggestions as isbut will let you know before i do once i‚Äôve heard back from them in return do you have any intel on rt relations,1,True,0,austria,england,10,29,Fall,1901
so for what its worth france thinks im an ally of germany and so doesnt want to share their plans with me unless i join in a 3way alliance with them and germany against italy which sounds weird and i dont know how that would work  i think theyre just not really experienced at this game but at the same time dont seem too inclined to take my suggestions either  so i think that any info i pass on to them might just backfire  i did already mention that losing burgundy now would cause their entire position to crumble which is the truth so perhaps theyre already planning to cover that i would if i were them probably,1,True,0,austria,england,10,30,Fall,1901
thanks if i were them i definitely would move to bur i would also move to tyr but i‚Äôm weird,1,True,0,england,austria,10,31,Fall,1901
oh i would totally move to trl  i thought about suggesting it to them actually before i talked to you about the various misdirection ideas,1,True,0,austria,england,10,32,Fall,1901
its a fun english position when france cant build a second fleet  youre sittin in the cat seat now,1,True,0,austria,england,10,33,Winter,1901
yeah those french moves were interesting to say the least definitely makes life easier  you‚Äôre not doing too bad yourself with turkey being so bunched up and russia struggling in swe,1,True,0,england,austria,10,34,Spring,1902
i didn‚Äôt even notice a smy,1,True,0,england,austria,10,35,Spring,1902
yeah a smy is an interesting choice f smy slows italy and i down but leaves arm undefended against russia  a arm keeps the russian at bay but means that frankly i could take bul and then leave the turk bottled up behind the bosporus forever guarded by only one unit  it‚Äôs like england with no fleets,1,True,0,austria,england,10,36,Spring,1902
fun times in both of our spheres  you and me and germany are looking pretty nice  do you and i wait until tf are more dismantled before we talk about coordinating our next target or do we start musing that now üôÇ,1,True,0,austria,england,10,37,Fall,1902

greeting oh sultan of turkey  any thoughts on the way you‚Äôd like to play this game  i tend to love at alliances with austria building lots of armies and turkey going mostly fleets because breaking through to the ionian sea can be pretty hard otherwise  we could go after russia first and once they‚Äôre weakened turn some force on italy as well  lots of loot to split up and keep us both happy for quite some time what do you think,1,True,0,austria,turkey,10,0,Spring,1901
i think that idea would work very well you will most likely need to get a truce with italy for the first few phases to protect your back until i can get ships in the area,1,True,0,turkey,austria,10,1,Spring,1901
sounds good  if i italy is not lying to me i could get that truce  what do you think we should do with russia then try and trick him into leaving either galacia or the black sea empty i don‚Äôt imagine we‚Äôd be so lucky as to have him do both but you never know some people are just trusting like that üôÇ   if you control bla we make pretty short work of the southern russian position rum and sev fall in a year or two  but if he‚Äôs cagey and careful it‚Äôll go slower,1,True,0,austria,turkey,10,2,Spring,1901
that sounds good to me i will talk with russia about having a dmz in bla so i can move in,1,True,0,turkey,austria,10,3,Spring,1901
so did russia agree to leave bla empty as a dmz and then go in anyway or was that an arranged bounce like him and i in gal,1,True,0,austria,turkey,10,4,Fall,1901
no the bounce wasnt planned could you support bul to rum or are you supporting alb to gre,1,True,0,turkey,austria,10,5,Fall,1901
ok sorry for the slow reply was a busy morning  so normally id be supporting myself into gre as thats the safest thing for me to do from a selfish perspective but one which gets me no goodwill from an ally  but youd like my support for bulrum while presumably following up conbul and trying for ankbla again so that russia has to choose do a supported attack on rum letting you into bla or else bounce you in bla and let you have rum is that the proposal,1,True,0,austria,turkey,10,6,Fall,1901
hey turkey i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre probably having an actual life and enjoying nye but we should make sure to coordinate for the fall which will be adjudicated in 13hrs  as of now we haven‚Äôt fully agreed on anything because i haven‚Äôt heard back from you yet,1,True,0,austria,turkey,10,7,Fall,1901
sorry i didnt get back to you sooner my plan is essentially what youve already laid out i will move bul to rum and ank to bla but i will be moving con to smy so i can get a ship for certain,1,True,0,turkey,austria,10,8,Fall,1901
hey was having nye dinner with the fam  sounds reasonable i can support that move even if i can‚Äôt guarantee that it succeeds since russia could order ukr and sev to work together on rum but it‚Äôs worth a shot,0,True,0,austria,turkey,10,9,Fall,1901
well i guess my move didnt upload for some reason but i see it doesnt particularly matter since you betrayed me,0,True,-1,turkey,austria,10,10,Winter,1901
yeah sorry about that  it looks like it was a good choice for me though because had i supported the move you didnt manage to submit i would have pissed off the russian while they still got what they wanted without my support and had i wanted to keep going after them they would have seen it coming  but i apologize i did not follow through on the support you asked for this time,1,True,1,austria,turkey,10,11,Winter,1901
greetings  we probably don‚Äôt have too much interesting to say to each other this early in the game but we both probably care what italy and germany do  what have you heard,1,True,0,austria,france,10,0,Spring,1901
wow we should talk france drop me a line when you feel up for it eh,1,True,0,austria,france,10,1,Fall,1901
sorry for not replying i was a bit busy i will move back from italy,1,True,0,france,austria,10,2,Fall,1901
no worries  we all have lives  do you think youll be able to trust germany while england is jumping all over you  id be worried about an eg tag team attack if i were you that can end very badly if they get an english army on the continent and a german army in burgundy,1,True,0,austria,france,10,3,Fall,1901
well it is not something i wish to share with you as a close ally with germany but i proposed him a tripartite attack on italy all three of us gain something while i mostly get to trust germany,1,,0,france,austria,10,4,Fall,1901
fair enough  im not an avowed ally of germany or anything  so far weve just both agreed to stay out of tyrolia so we dont need to watch our backs  but i understand you may need to keep some of your choices close to the vest  however if you do decide to go after italy thats something id like to know about as thats right on my doorstep  theyre a natural target for the two of us to go after but im not sure how germany could easily participate in that what supply center of italy would they hold which wouldnt stretch them right next to my own home centers,1,True,0,austria,france,10,5,Fall,1901
looks like germany and england are against me,1,True,-1,france,austria,10,6,Winter,1901
indeed as i suspected and tried to warn you about and in particular the move to burgundy i think i mentioned was pretty obvious  one strategy ive sometimes found useful when getting tagteamed by forces more numerous than my own ask a neighbor to come to your aid with the promise that if i start to collapse ill let that neighbor take my centers to spike those who are attacking me  in this case you could ask italy to move venpie so that they can support marseille or if youre really struggling at some point they can take it from you and use that to help you hold eg at bay until they inevitably start fighting each other  in fact once italy is on your doorstep and eg see this the mere threat of someone else getting your supply centers sometimes leads to them attacking each other instead,1,False,1,austria,france,10,7,Winter,1901
nice defense  retreat to gas to cut off germany‚Äôs only allowed retreat and they have to rebuild in berlin and kiel way far away maybe you can even convince them to back off now  maybe even build fleets and go after england,1,True,1,austria,france,10,8,Fall,1902
build with what,1,True,-1,france,austria,10,9,Fall,1902
germany‚Äôs only legal retreat is gas  if you choose gas as your retreat as well both units are destroyed  they picked up sweden this year as well so if they have to disband bur but go up one center from swe they have two builds coming  those two could both be fleets if they wanted to go after england and give up on attacking you,1,True,1,austria,france,10,10,Fall,1902
will england go for brest,1,True,-1,france,austria,10,11,Fall,1902
what do you mean  england just successfully took brest right  what are you asking,1,True,1,austria,france,10,12,Fall,1902
oh wait i realize now that germany will have an available retreat pic  arg  that is unfortunate,1,True,1,austria,france,10,13,Fall,1902
so i guess you can retreat to gas and decide whether to keep all three of your armies or keep the fleet and lose one of them  im not sure which is more valuable  armies will hold germany off longer but that fleet may allow you to pick up portugal and survive longer  i could attack italy to get them off your back but what you really want is italy helping you not attacking you  youre in a tight spot,1,True,1,austria,france,10,14,Fall,1902
what are your standings with germany,1,True,-5,france,austria,10,15,Spring,1904

what is your relationship with italy right now,1,True,5,austria,france,10,17,Spring,1904
i am working with italy and we have agreed on something i was thinking could you support me in munich i am just willing to mess up and shake his position a bit,1,True,-5,france,austria,10,18,Spring,1904
i can probably try to support that attack but if kie  ber s mun to hold our attack wont succeed and mun s parbur would dislodge you  if that happens you can retreat to ruh which would totally cause tons of german pain especially as russia comes to help so that could still be a good risk to take,1,True,5,austria,france,10,19,Spring,1904
i was going on the same line but it is hard to expect he will go for such defensive moves,1,True,-5,france,austria,10,20,Spring,1904
this is where diplomacy comes in if i can convince them that im going to not attack we have a chance,1,True,5,austria,france,10,21,Spring,1904
maybe through italy this could work he obviously wont buy my shit,1,True,-5,france,austria,10,22,Spring,1904

thats ok and should work,1,True,-5,france,austria,10,24,Spring,1904
well that sure annoyed the german üôÇ,1,True,5,austria,france,10,25,Fall,1904
hey there  any chance you can use munich to hit berlin  you could cut a support so that russia and i could crush one of their units and press up to the german border more,1,True,5,austria,france,10,26,Fall,1904
sure i will do that,1,True,-5,france,austria,10,27,Fall,1904
i wasnt expecting germany to throw their entire armed forces at just retaking munich but im kinda glad they did they crumbled their entire defenses doing so  might as well keep the fleet in mar its possible with italys position we can even keep you alive in there,1,True,5,austria,france,10,28,Fall,1904
well i did my best here,1,True,-5,france,austria,10,29,Fall,1904
surviving a concerted 21 this long is no small feat  wish i could‚Äôve been able to help sooner  for what it‚Äôs worth i‚Äôm not attacking italy for now so that they can continue to work together with you to hold eg off,1,True,5,austria,france,10,30,Fall,1904
thanks i have tried my best to break that alliance but to no avail i do understand that you as austria and italy wont be interested in fighting germany in early game no hard feelings against anyone but i do feel like revenging on germany or england in any way possible,1,True,-5,france,austria,10,31,Fall,1904

unfortunately i cannot support you against germany at this time france is teetering but not gone and i do not have an army large enough to launch an invasion of germany  i hope that sticking to my word in norway and my forthrightness with intelligence will be enough to continue our amicable relationship  turkey is trapped in the south with that odd a smy build but on the plus side that strategic limitation opens up a russo turkish alliance that is far less threatening than a normal juggernaut  maybe you could offer swe to germany in exchange for you and i destroying one of his two fleets i‚Äôd prefer to not offer the idea on my own also if he does not pass it along to me that will tell us both a great deal about his naval and northern ambitions,1,True,0,england,russia,10,17,Spring,1902
ok i understand and yes i still consider us on good terms how does the destroy german fleet trade work again,1,True,0,russia,england,10,18,Spring,1902
say that you can cede swe but two german fleets on the baltic represent ongoing threat to stp you can ask him if he is open to destroying his second fleet in 1903  if germany is open to that the only way i see it happening is if i support you into swe in spring 1903 he destroys and then i support him back into swe in fall 1903,1,True,0,england,russia,10,19,Spring,1902
im assuming its an all out attack on france kind of turn,1,True,-1,russia,england,10,20,Spring,1903
yes you should consider doing something like self bouncing in lithuania germany is coming for you,1,True,1,england,russia,10,21,Spring,1903
you mean livonia wait where am i getting attacked thanks for the headsup i have some italian intelligence you may want,1,True,-1,russia,england,10,22,Spring,1903
i don‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs attacking you self bouncing up there delays his attack into stp  what‚Äôs the italian intelligence,1,True,1,england,russia,10,23,Spring,1903
not sure what the italian is scheming they told me they were going lepanto but i havent been negotiating with them much,0,True,-1,russia,england,10,24,Spring,1903
sorry i failed to tip you off about italy moving west i second guessed telling you bc i wasnt sure it was accurate do you think that will be harmful to you or can you use the italians to help finish off france it looks like you have spain in the bag but mar and par might be a little more challenging what do you have planned for the fleet heading north,1,True,-1,russia,england,10,25,Spring,1903
the italians can‚Äôt help me  it is just sitting there it‚Äôs meant to not threaten swe and to hold nth,1,True,1,england,russia,10,26,Fall,1903
whats the play in 1904 are you threatening denmark,1,True,1,russia,england,10,27,Spring,1904
no i‚Äôm just holding nth  thank you for building on the south coast instead of the north i request that you do not put an army in stp i have stayed out of norway because you have not put an army in stp or a fleet in stpnc  i made a similar request to germany last year i asked that he take stp with a fleet instead of an army and then warned you of an attack,1,,-1,england,russia,10,28,Spring,1904
i used the wrong set of words i meant securing nth instead of holding it i‚Äôm not currently planning on taking stp or supporting an attack there  my apologies for using the wrong word i know that there is a big difference between holding and securing,1,False,-1,england,russia,10,29,Fall,1904
